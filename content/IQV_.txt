our market opportunity 

we compete in a market of greater than 285 billion consisting of outsourced research and development realworld evidence and connected health and technology enabled clinical and commercial operations markets for life sciences companies and the broader healthcare industry the following sets forth our estimates for the size of our principal markets 

• outsourced research and development biopharmaceutical spending on drug development totaled approximately 150 billion in 2021 of that amount we estimate that our addressable opportunity clinical development spending excluding preclinical spending was approximately 81 billion the portion of this addressable opportunity that was outsourced in 2021 based on our estimates was approximately 39 billion 

• realworld evidence and connected health total addressable market of approximately 60 billion based on 2021 sales that consists of tightly coupled life sciences and healthcare markets first the life sciences market for realworld evidence of approximately 20 billion includes postlaunch evidence generation market access and patient engagement services second the market for connected healthcare of approximately 40 billion includes areas such as revenue cycle management payer analytics and clinical decision support services and 

• technology enabled commercial operations total addressable market of approximately 75 billion based on 2021 sales that includes information data warehousing it outsourcing software applications and other services in the broader market for it services this addressable market also includes commercial services such as recruiting training deploying and managing global sales forces channel management patient engagement services market access consulting brand communication advisory services and health information analytics and technology consulting 

in deriving estimates of the size of the various markets described above we review thirdparty sources which include estimates and forecasts of spending in various segments in combination with internal iqvia research and analysis informed by our experience serving these segments as well as projected growth rates for each of these segments see “industry and market data” above 

we believe there are six key trends affecting our end markets that will create increasing demand for research and development services technology  analytics solutions and contract sales and medical solutions 

growth and innovation in the life sciences industry the life sciences industry is a large and critical part of the global healthcare system and according to the latest information available from the iqvia market prognosis service is estimated to have generated approximately 142 trillion in revenue in 2021 according to our research revenue growth in the life sciences industry globally is expected to range from 3 to 6 between 2022 and 2026 according to the iqvia institute it is estimated that spending on pharmaceuticals in emerging markets will expand at a 5 to 8 compound annual growth rate “cagr” through 2026 the growth of emerging markets demonstrates their strategic importance to global life sciences organizations along with the emergence of local and regional companies with similar operational and informational needs we expect all of these organizations to apply a high degree of sophistication to their commercial operations in these countries especially as some begin to emerge as sources of original innovative products for global companies this requires highly localized knowledge and information assets the development of market access strategies and performance benchmarking in addition local players are learning that they need to compete on the basis of improved information and analytics 

growth in research and development spending trends in research and development are impacted as a result of several factors including major biopharmaceutical companies’ efforts to replenish revenues lost from the socalled “patent cliff” increased access to capital by the small and midcap biotechnology industry and recent increases in pharmaceutical approvals by regulatory authorities the iqvia institute also estimates that approximately 300 new molecular entities “nmes” are expected to be approved between 2022 and 2026 or 60 per year compared to 53 per year on average during the past decade we believe that further research and development spending combined with the continued need for cost efficiency across the healthcare landscape will continue to create opportunities for biopharmaceutical services companies particularly those with a global reach and broad service offerings to help biopharmaceutical companies with their pre and postlaunch solutions development and commercialization needs 

increased complexity in research and development biopharmaceutical companies face environments in which it has become increasingly difficult to operate improved standards of care in many therapeutic areas and the emergence of new types of therapies such as biologics genetically targeted therapies gene and stem cell therapies and other treatment modalities have led to more complex development and regulatory pathways we believe that our global clinical development capabilities including our expertise in biomarkers and genomics and our global laboratory network position us well to help biopharmaceutical companies manage the complexities inherent in an environment where this type of expertise is important for example connected intelligence helps us validate protocols to ensure studies in new disease areas have greater accuracy and also enables us through innovations such as predictive analytics to find patients who may not have been diagnosed 

regulators require clinical trials involving local populations as part of the process for approving new pharmaceutical products especially in certain asian and emerging markets understanding the epidemiological and physiological differences in different ethnic populations and being able to conduct clinical trials locally in certain geographies will be important to pharmaceutical product growth strategies both for multinational and localregional biopharmaceutical companies we believe that our global clinical development capabilities and unmatched presence in asia and other emerging markets make us a strong partner for biopharmaceutical companies managing the complexities of international drug development 

financial pressures driving the need for increased efficiency despite expected accelerating growth in the global life sciences market we believe our clients will face increased operating margin pressure due to their changing product mix pricing and reimbursement challenges and rising costs of compliance product portfolios for life sciences companies have shifted toward specialty products with lower peak market sales potential than traditional primary care medicines we believe that the need for biopharmaceutical companies to maximize productivity and lower costs across their processes from research and development through commercial operations will cause them to look to partners as they enter into outsourcing arrangements to improve efficiency further our clients are looking for new ways to simplify processes and drive operational efficiencies by using automation consolidating vendors and adopting new technology options such as hosted and cloudbased applications this provides opportunities for technology services vendors to capture and consolidate internal spending by providing lowercost and variablecost options that lower clients’ research and development selling marketing and administrative costs 

evolving need to integrate and structure expanding sources of data over the past decade many health systems around the world have focused on digitizing medical records while such records theoretically enhance access to data relevant information is often unintegrated unstructured siloed in disparate software systems or entered inconsistently in addition new sources of data from the internet such as social media and information on limited patient pools and information resulting from enhanced diagnostic technologies are creating new sources of healthcare data 

in order to derive valuable insights from existing and expanding sources of information clients need access to statistically significant data sets organized into databases that can be queried and analyzed for example realworld evidence studies demonstrate practical and clinical efficacies which we believe require the aggregation and integration of large clinical data sets across all care settings types of therapies and patient cohorts longitudinal studies require analysis of nonidentified patient diagnoses treatments procedures and laboratory test results to identify types of patients that will likely best respond to particular therapies finally manufacturers also require the ability to analyze social media activity to identify unmet patient needs and support for new orphan drugs this information is highly relevant to all healthcare stakeholders and we believe the opportunity to more broadly apply healthcare data can only be realized through structuring organizing and integrating new and existing forms of data in conjunction with sophisticated analytics 

need for demonstrated value in healthcare participants in the healthcare industry are focused on improving quality and reducing costs both of which require assessment of quality and value of therapies and providers as a result physicians no longer make prescribing decisions in isolation but rather in the context of guidance and rules from payers integrated delivery networks and governments we believe life sciences companies are working to bring alignment across constituents on the value of their treatments in order to successfully develop and commercialize new therapies 

there is increasing pressure on life sciences companies to support and justify the value of their therapies many new drugs that are being approved are more expensive than existing therapies and will likely receive heightened scrutiny by regulators and payers to determine whether the existing treatment options would be sufficient additionally many new specialty drugs are molecularbased therapies and require a more detailed understanding of clinical factors and influencers that demonstrate therapeutic value as a result leading life sciences companies are utilizing more sophisticated outcome research and data analytics services 

we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of these global trends in healthcare beyond our proprietary information assets we have developed key capabilities to assess opportunities to develop and commercialize therapies support and defend the value of medicines and help our clients operate more efficiently through the application of insightdriven decisionmaking and costefficient technology solutions

good clinical practice 

good clinical practice “gcp” regulations and guidelines are the industry standard for the conduct of clinical trials with respect to maintaining the integrity of the data and safety of the research subjects the united states food and drug administration “fda” the european medicines agency “ema” japan’s ministry of health labor and welfare and most other global regulatory authorities expect that study results and data submitted to such authorities be based on clinical trials conducted in accordance with gcp provisions records for clinical trials must be maintained for specified periods for inspection by the fda and other regulators 

regulation of drugs biologics and medical devices 

in the united states pharmaceutical biological and medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by the fda the federal food drug and cosmetic act “fdc act” the public health service act “phs act” and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern among other things the research development testing manufacture storage recordkeeping approval labeling promotion and marketing distribution postapproval monitoring and reporting sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical biological and medical device products failure to comply with applicable united states requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions such as fda refusal to approve a pending new drug application “nda” for a new drug a biologics license application “bla” for a new biological product premarket approval “pma” or clearance for a new medical device warning or untitled letters clinical holds product recalls product seizures total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions fines civil penalties and criminal prosecution 

regulation of patient information 

our information management services relate to the processing of information regarding patient diagnosis and treatment of disease and are therefore subject to substantial governmental regulation in addition the confidentiality of patientspecific information and the circumstances under which such patientspecific records may be released for inclusion in our databases or used in other aspects of our business is heavily regulated federal state and foreign governments are contemplating or have proposed or adopted additional legislation governing the possession use and dissemination of personal data such as personal health information and personal financial data as well as security breach notification rules for loss or theft of such data additional legislation or regulation of this type might among other things require us to implement additional security measures and processes or bring within the legislation or regulation deidentified health or other data each of which may require substantial expenditures or limit our ability to offer some of our services 

in particular personal health information is recognized in many countries such as the united states the european union or eu and several countries in asia as a special sensitive category of personal information subject to additional mandatory protections violations of data protection regulations are subject to administrative penalties civil money penalties and criminal prosecution including corporate fines and personal liability 

regulation of promotion marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products and medical devices 

certain of our services are subject to detailed and comprehensive regulation in each geographic market in which we operate such regulation relates among other things to the distribution of drug samples the marketing and promotion of approved products the qualifications of sales representatives and the use of healthcare professionals in sales functions 

in the united states certain of our services are subject to numerous federal and state laws pertaining to promotional activities involving pharmaceutical products and medical devices certain of our services are subject to the fda’s regulations against “offlabel promotion” which require sales representatives to restrict promotion of the approved product they are detailing to the approved labeling for the product the prescription drug marketing act imposes licensing personnel record keeping packaging labeling product handling and facility storage and security requirements other federal and state laws prohibit manufacturers suppliers and providers from offering giving or receiving kickbacks or other remuneration in connection with ordering or recommending the purchase or rental of healthcare items and services the sale or distribution of pharmaceutical products and devices is also governed by the united states federal trade commission act and state consumer protection laws we are subject to similar regulations currently in effect in the other countries where we offer contract sales  medical solutions 

we are also subject to various laws and regulations that may apply to certain drug and device promotional practices including among others various aspects of medicare and federal healthcare programs violations of these laws and regulations may result in criminal andor civil penalties including possibly as an “aider and abettor” 

regulation of laboratories 

our united states laboratories are subject to licensing and regulation under federal state and local laws relating to hazard communication and employee righttoknow regulations and the safety and health of laboratory employees additionally our united states laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations and licensing requirements relating to the handling storage and disposal of hazardous waste radioactive materials and laboratory specimens including the regulations of the environmental protection agency the nuclear regulatory commission the department of transportation the national fire protection agency and the united states drug enforcement administration “dea” the use of controlled substances in testing for drugs with a potential for abuse is regulated in the united states by the dea and by similar regulatory bodies in other parts of the world our united states laboratories using controlled substances for testing purposes are licensed by the dea the regulations of the united states department of transportation public health service and postal service apply to the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens our laboratories also are subject to international air transport association regulations which govern international shipments of laboratory specimens furthermore when the materials are sent to a foreign country the transportation of such materials becomes subject to the laws rules and regulations of such foreign country our laboratories outside the united states are subject to applicable national laws governing matters such as licensing the handling and disposal of medical specimens genetic material hazardous waste and radioactive materials as well as the health and safety of laboratory employees 

in addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace the united states occupational safety and health administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers may be exposed to bloodborne pathogens such as hiv and the hepatitis b virus although we believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with such federal state and local laws failure to comply with such laws could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business fines criminal penalties and other enforcement actions 

further laboratories that analyze human blood or other biological samples for the diagnosis and treatment of clinical trial subjects must comply with clinical laboratory improvement amendments “clia” as well as requirements established by various states the failure to meet these requirements may result in civil penalties and suspension or revocation of the clia certification 

data privacy 

patient health information is among the most sensitive of personal information and it is critically important that information about an individual’s healthcare is properly protected from inappropriate access use and disclosure real world evidence  information that allows us to examine actual practices and outcomes  is essential to increase access to care improve outcomes and lower costs iqvia uses a wide variety of privacyenhancing technologies and safeguards to protect individual privacy while generating and analyzing information on a scale that helps healthcare stakeholders identify disease patterns and correlate with the precise treatment path and therapy needed for better outcomes we employ a wide variety of methods to manage privacy requirements including 

• governance frameworks models and training to promote good decision making and accountability

human capital 

overview our approximately 79000 employees help us drive our business success and achieve our ambition to advance human health we are a diverse global team that shares a passion for collaboration and solving complex problems our workforce is comprised of a wide variety of professionals including clinicians data scientists epidemiologists and more 

our culture is one in which employees are encouraged to apply their insight curiosity and intellectual courage across everything they do the way we manage our people and the programs we offer our employees reflect our commitment to fostering this culture of empowerment and engagement 

each one of our employees provide value no matter where they sit within the organization we are committed to creating an environment where all employees are respected and heard where people from all backgrounds can contribute to and share in our growth and where opportunity and advancement is available to everyone 

attracting developing and retaining a talented workforce is essential to the success of our business and the realization of our purpose investments in our people are motivated by our desire to have an engaged and connected workforce this results in high productivity and better results for iqvia in an industry as competitive as ours we also recognize that employees who feel supported contribute to higher retention and recruitment rates 

board oversight of human capital management our board of directors the “board” receives regular updates on key human capital metrics including recruitment and attrition rates talent development data and diversity statistics related to hiring promotion and our overall workforce 

the board also devotes significant time to leadership development and succession planning at the executive level and provides guidance on important decisions in each of these areas the leadership development and compensation committee of the board has primary responsibility for succession planning for the chief executive officer and oversight of succession planning for senior leadership 

human capital management strategy our employees are critical to our continued success and are a core element of our longterm strategy senior management is responsible for ensuring that our initiatives policies and processes reflect and reinforce our desired corporate culture which we believe supports successful human capital management our human capital management strategy is built on three fundamental focus areas 

• recruitment  we consider a range of qualified candidates for all positions we hire qualified individuals with a variety of backgrounds and experiences from both within and outside the organization for positions at all levels 

• development  progression  we are committed to having a diverse pipeline of talent moving up in our organization and providing opportunities for all employees to develop within their current role as well as towards their next role we do this by encouraging mentoring and establishing support networks as well as by providing tools to help employees map out and achieve their career goals

for a more complete discussion of the material risk facing our business see below 

risks relating to our business 

our business and operations has been and may in the future be adversely affected by the novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic and the various governmental industry and consumer actions related thereto had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these effects have included and may include in the future a negative impact on the availability of our key personnel temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our business partners customers suppliers third party service providers or other vendors an increased risk of customer defaults or delays in payments or purchasing decisions and the interruption of domestic and global supply chains distribution channels liquidity and capital or financial markets 

as covid19 including any variants continues to spread we have and may in the future experience disruptions that could severely impact our business including 

• closure or inaccessibility of clinical site locations 

• delays or difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials and starting new clinical trials 

• delays or difficulties in clinical site initiation including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff 

• interruption of key clinical trial activities such as clinical trial site monitoring due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments employers and others 

• delays in receiving approval from local regulatory authorities to initiate our planned clinical trials 

• significant disruption in our businesses that rely on facetoface interactions or are dependent on inperson gatherings events or conferences and 

• significant and unpredictable reductions or increases in demand for certain of our offerings 

in addition we have directed a substantial portion of our workforce to work from home while the outbreak persists in order to help minimize the risk of covid19 to our employees having a significant portion of our workforce working from home has caused an increased risk of loss of productivity greater cybersecurity risk and increased risk to our system of internal controls over financial reporting to the extent global conditions improve the duration and sustainability of any such improvements will be uncertain and continuing adverse impacts andor the degree of improvement may vary by geography the actions we take in response to any improvements in conditions such as our returntooffice plans may also vary by geography and by business and will likely be made with incomplete information there is a risk that such actions may prove to be premature incorrect or insufficient and could have a material and adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

further the effects of the pandemic may also increase our cost of capital or make additional capital more difficult or available only on terms less favorable to us 

the potential loss or delay of our large contracts or of multiple contracts could adversely affect our results 

most of our research  development solutions clients can terminate our contracts upon 30 to 90 days notice our clients may delay terminate or reduce the scope of our contracts for a variety of reasons beyond our control including but not limited to 

• decisions to forego or terminate a particular clinical trial 

• lack of available financing budgetary limits or changing priorities 

• actions by regulatory authorities 

• production problems resulting in shortages of the drug being tested 

• failure of products being tested to satisfy safety requirements or efficacy criteria 

• unexpected or undesired clinical results for products 

• insufficient patient enrollment in a clinical trial 

• insufficient investigator recruitment 

• shift of business to a competitor or internal resources 

• product withdrawal following market launch or 

• shut down of manufacturing facilities 

the covid19 pandemic or a similar global event could also exacerbate many of the above situations and cause delays changes in scope or cancellation of our contracts as a result contract terminations delays and alterations are a regular part of our research  development solutions business in the event of termination our contracts often provide for fees for winding down the project but these fees may not be sufficient for us to realize the full amount of revenues or profits anticipated under the related services contracts and termination may result in lower resource utilization rates in addition we will not realize the full benefits of our backlog of contractually committed services if our clients cancel delay or reduce their commitments under our contracts with them which may occur if among other things a client decides to shift its business to a competitor or revoke our status as a preferred provider thus the loss or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could adversely affect our revenues and profitability we believe the risk of loss or delay of multiple contracts potentially has greater effect where we are party to broader partnering arrangements with global biopharmaceutical companies 

we depend on third parties for data and support services our suppliers or providers might restrict our use of or refuse to license data or provide services which could lead to our inability to access certain data or provide certain services and as a result materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

each of our technology  analytics solutions information services is derived from data we collect from third parties these data suppliers are numerous and diverse reflecting the broad scope of information that we collect and use in our business 

although we typically enter into longterm contractual arrangements with many of these suppliers of data at the time of entry into a new contract or renewal of an existing contract suppliers may increase restrictions on our use of such data increase the price they charge us for data or refuse altogether to license the data to us in addition during the term of any data supply contract suppliers may fail to adhere to our data quality control standards or fail to deliver data further although no single individual data supplier is material to our business if a number of suppliers collectively representing a significant amount of data that we use for one or more of our services were to impose additional contractual restrictions on our use of or access to data fail to adhere to our qualitycontrol standards repeatedly fail to deliver data or refuse to provide data now or in the future our ability to provide those services to our clients could be materially adversely impacted which may harm our operating results and financial condition 

additionally we depend on third parties for support services to our business such support services include but are not limited to third party transportation providers suppliers of drugs for patients participating in clinical trials suppliers of kits for use in our clinical trial laboratories business suppliers of reagents for use in our testing equipment and providers of maintenance contracts for our equipment the failure of any of these third parties to adequately provide the critical support services could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if we fail to perform our services in accordance with contractual requirements regulatory standards and ethical considerations we could be subject to significant costs or liability and our reputation could be harmed 

we contract with biopharmaceutical companies to perform a wide range of services to assist them in bringing new drugs to market our services include monitoring clinical trials data and laboratory analysis electronic data capture patient recruitment and other related services and we perform these services in a number of ways including through physical and technologyenabled efforts such services are complex and subject to contractual requirements regulatory standards and ethical considerations for example we must adhere to regulatory requirements such as the fda and current gcp and good laboratory practice requirements if we fail to perform our services in accordance with these requirements regulatory agencies may take action against us for failure to comply with applicable regulations governing clinical trials or sales and marketing practices such actions may include sanctions such as injunctions or failure of such regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of products delay suspension or withdrawal of approvals license revocation product seizures or recalls operational restrictions civil or criminal penalties or prosecutions damages or fines clients may also bring claims against us for breach of our contractual obligations and patients in the clinical trials and patients taking drugs approved on the basis of those clinical trials may bring personal injury claims against us for negligence any such action could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and reputation 

such consequences could arise if among other things the following occur 

improper performance of our services the performance of clinical development services is complex and timeconsuming for example we may make mistakes in conducting a clinical trial that could negatively impact or obviate the usefulness of the clinical trial or cause the results of the clinical trial to be reported improperly if the clinical trial results are compromised we could be subject to significant costs or liability which could have an adverse impact on our ability to perform our services as examples 

• noncompliance generally could result in the termination of ongoing clinical trials or sales and marketing projects or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities 

• compromise of data from a particular clinical trial such as failure to verify that informed consent was obtained from patients could require us to repeat the clinical trial under the terms of our contract at no further cost to our client but at a substantial cost to us and 

• breach of a contractual term could result in liability for damages or termination of the contract 

large clinical trials can cost up to hundreds of millions of dollars and while we endeavor to contractually limit our exposure to such risks improper performance of our services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition damage our reputation and result in the cancellation of current contracts by or failure to obtain future contracts from the affected client or other clients 

investigation of clients from time to time one or more of our clients are audited or investigated by regulatory authorities or enforcement agencies with respect to regulatory compliance of their clinical trials programs or the marketing and sale of their drugs in these situations we have often provided services to our clients with respect to the clinical trials programs or activities being audited or investigated and we are called upon to respond to requests for information by the authorities and agencies there is a risk that either our clients or regulatory authorities could claim that we performed our services improperly or that we are responsible for clinical trial or program compliance if our clients or regulatory authorities make such claims against us and prove them we could be subject to damages fines or penalties in addition negative publicity regarding regulatory compliance of our clients’ clinical trials programs or drugs could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

insufficient client funding to complete a clinical trial as noted above clinical trials can cost hundreds of millions of dollars there is a risk that we may initiate a clinical trial for a client and then the client becomes unwilling or unable to fund the completion of the clinical trial in such a situation notwithstanding the client’s ability or willingness to pay for or otherwise facilitate the completion of the clinical trial we may be ethically bound to complete or wind down the clinical trial at our own expense 

security breaches and unauthorized use of our it systems and information or the it systems or information in the possession of our vendors could expose us our clients our data suppliers or others to risk of loss 

we rely upon the security of our computer and communications systems infrastructure to protect us from cyberattacks and unauthorized access cyberattacks can include malware computer viruses hacking or other significant disruption of our computer communications and related systems cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems as cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against one or more cyber threats might defeat the measures that we or our vendors take to anticipate detect avoid or mitigate such threats certain techniques used to obtain unauthorized access introduce malicious software disable or degrade service or sabotage systems may be designed to remain dormant until a triggering event and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures since techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources although we take steps to manage and avoid these risks and to prevent their recurrence our preventive and remedial actions may not be successful such attacks whether successful or unsuccessful could result in our incurring costs related to for example rebuilding internal systems defending against litigation responding to regulatory inquiries or actions paying damages or fines or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties publicity about vulnerabilities and attempted or successful incursions could damage our reputation with clients and data suppliers and reduce demand for our services 

we also store proprietary and sensitive information in connection with our business which could be compromised by a cyberattack to the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data an inappropriate disclosure of proprietary or sensitive information an inability to access data sources or an inability to process data or provide our offerings to our clients it could cause significant damage to our reputation affect our relationships with our data suppliers and clients including loss of suppliers and clients lead to claims against us and ultimately harm our business we may be required to incur significant costs to alleviate remedy or protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future we may also face inquiry or increased scrutiny from government agencies as a result of any such disruption or breach while we have insurance coverage for certain instances of a cyber security breach our coverage may not be sufficient if we suffer a significant attack or multiple attacks any such breach or disruption could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and our reputation as a service provider 

some of our vendors have significant responsibility for the security of certain of our data centers and computerbased platforms or softwareasaservice saas applications upon which our businesses rely to host or process data or to perform various functions also our data suppliers have responsibility for security of their own computer and communications environments these third parties face risks relating to cyber security similar to ours which could disrupt their businesses and therefore materially impact ours accordingly we are subject to any flaw in or breaches to their computer and communications systems or those that they operate for us which could result in a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial results 

failure to meet productivity objectives under our internal business transformation initiatives could adversely impact our competitiveness and harm our operating results 

we are pursuing business transformation initiatives to update technology increase innovation and obtain operating efficiencies as part of these initiatives which include accelerating site startup timelines and improving our customer buying experience we seek to improve our productivity flexibility quality functionality and cost savings by investing in the development and implementation of global platforms and integration of our business processes and functions to achieve economies of scale these various initiatives may not yield their intended gains or be completed in timely manner which may impact our competitiveness and our ability to meet our growth objectives and as a result materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

if we are unsuccessful at investing in growth opportunities our business could be materially and adversely affected 

we continue to invest significantly in growth opportunities including the development and acquisition of new data technologies and services to meet our clients’ needs for example we are expanding our services and technology offerings such as the development of a cloudbased platform with a growing number of applications to support commercial and clinical operations for life sciences companies eg multichannel marketing marketing campaign management customer relationship management incentive compensation management targeting and segmentation performance management site engagement payments trial master file risk based monitoring inhome nursing and other services clinical trial management and decentralized trials and other applications we also continue to invest significantly in growth opportunities in emerging markets such as the development launch and enhancement of services in china india russia turkey and other countries we consider our presence in these markets to be an important component of our growth strategy 

there is no assurance that our investment plans or growth strategy will be successful or will produce a sufficient or any return on our investments further if we are unable to develop new technologies and services clients do not purchase our new technologies and services our new technologies and services do not work as intended or there are delays in the availability or adoption of our new technologies and services then we may not be able to grow our business or growth may occur slower than anticipated additionally although we expect continued growth in healthcare spending in emerging markets such spending may occur more slowly or not at all and we may not benefit from our investments in these markets 

we plan to fund growth opportunities with cash from operations or from future financings there can be no assurance that those sources will be available in sufficient amounts to fund future growth opportunities when needed 

any of the foregoing could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

data protection privacy and similar laws in the united states and around the world restrict access use and disclosure of personal information and failure to comply with or adapt to changes in these laws could materially and adversely harm our business 

the confidentiality collection use retention security transfer and disclosure of personal data including individually identifiable health information and clinical trial patientspecific information are subject to governmental regulation generally in the country that the personal data were collected or used collectively privacy laws for example united states federal regulations under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” create specific requirements for the protection of the privacy and security of individual health information these provisions apply to both “covered entities” primarily health care providers and health insurers and their “business associates” or service providers as there are some instances where we are a hipaa “business associate” of a “covered entity” we can be directly liable for mishandling protected health information under hipaa’s enforcement scheme we can be subject to significant penalties in connection with hipaa violations along with the potential for significant other expenditures related to these activities these rules require individuals’ written authorization in many situations in addition to any required informed consent before protected health information may be used for research we are both directly and indirectly affected by the privacy provisions surrounding individual authorizations because many investigators with whom we are involved in clinical trials are directly subject to them as a hipaa “covered entity” and because we obtain identifiable health information from third parties that are subject to such regulations 

in general patient health information is among the most sensitive and highly regulated of personal information privacy laws in the united states and around the world are designed to ensure that information about an individual’s healthcare is properly protected from inappropriate access use and disclosure privacy laws also include the european union’s “eu” general data protection regulation canada’s personal information protection and electronic documents act and other data protection privacy data security data localization and similar national stateprovincial and local laws in the eu personal data includes any information that relates to an identifiable natural person health information about an identifiable person carries additional obligations under eu law including obtaining the explicit consent from the individual for collection use or disclosure of the information in addition we are subject to eu rules with respect to crossborder transfers of such data out of the eu along with similar data transfer requirements or data localization requirements in other countries 

we have established frameworks models processes and technologies to manage privacy and security for many data types from a variety of sources and under a myriad of privacy laws in addition we rely on our data suppliers to deliver information to us in a form and in a manner that complies with applicable privacy laws these laws are complex and there is no assurance that the safeguards and controls employed by us or our data suppliers will be sufficient to prevent a breach of these laws or that claims will not be filed against us or our data suppliers despite such safeguards and controls failure to comply with such laws certain certificationregistration and annual recertificationregistration provisions associated with these data protection and privacy regulations and similar rules in various jurisdictions or to resolve any serious privacy complaints may result in among other things regulatory sanctions criminal prosecution civil liability negative publicity damage to our reputation or data being blocked from use or liability under contractual provisions for example in july 2015 indictments were issued by the seoul central district prosecutors’ office in south korea against ims korea and two of its employees among others alleging improper handling of sensitive health information in violation of applicable privacy laws see item 3 “legal proceedings” for additional information 

laws and expectations relating to privacy continue to evolve and we continue to adapt to changing needs for example the definition of “personally identifiable information” and “personal data” continues to evolve and broaden and many new laws and regulations are being enacted in addition certain established programs have been or are at risk of being declared invalid such as the euus privacy shield framework that operated for several years but was struck down by the european court of justice in july 2020 so that this area remains in a state of flux changes to these programs may adversely impact our ability to provide services to our clients or develop new products or services federal state and foreign governments are contemplating or have proposed or adopted new privacy laws or modifications to existing privacy laws including by amendment replacement or interpretation through judicial or administrative decisions new or modified privacy laws might among other things require us to implement new security measures and processes or bring within the scope of the privacy law other data not currently regulated each of which may require substantial expenditures or limit our ability to offer some of our services additionally changes in privacy laws may limit our data access use and disclosure and may require increased expenditures by us or may dictate that we not offer certain types of services any of the foregoing may have a material adverse impact on our ability to provide services to our clients or maintain our profitability 

there is ongoing concern from privacy advocates regulators and others regarding data protection and privacy issues and the number of jurisdictions with privacy laws has been increasing also there are ongoing public policy discussions regarding whether the standards for deidentified anonymous or pseudonymized health information are sufficient and the risk of reidentification sufficiently small to adequately protect patient privacy these discussions may lead to further restrictions on the use of such information there can be no assurance that these initiatives or future initiatives will not adversely affect our ability to access and use data or to develop or market current or future services 

many privacy laws protect more than patient information and although they vary by jurisdiction these laws can extend to employee information business contact information provider information and other information relating to identifiable individuals failure to comply with these laws may result in among other things civil and criminal liability negative publicity damage to our reputation and liability under contractual provisions in addition compliance with such laws may require increased costs to us or may dictate that we not offer certain types of services 

the occurrence of any of the foregoing could impact our ability to provide the same level of service to our clients require us to modify our offerings or increase our costs which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 

our success depends in part upon our ability to develop use and protect our proprietary methodologies analytics systems technologies and other intellectual property we rely upon a combination of trade secrets confidentiality policies nondisclosure invention assignment and other contractual arrangements and patent copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights these laws are subject to change at any time and certain agreements may not be fully enforceable which could further restrict our ability to protect our innovations further these laws may not provide adequate protection for our intellectual property particularly in countries in which the legal system provides less protection for intellectual property rights our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing services similar to or duplicative of ours further the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors former employees or other third parties and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 

our ability to obtain protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation or thirdparty opposition risks as well as the uncertainty as to the scope of protection registrability patentability validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights in each applicable country governments may adopt regulations and government agencies or courts may render decisions requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property rights when we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights we may be subject to claims that the intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our confidential and proprietary information litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly time consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property rights furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management’s attention and resources could delay further sales or the implementation of our solutions impair the functionality of our solutions delay introductions of new solutions result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our solutions or injure our reputation and harm our operating results and financial condition 

the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could reduce the differentiation of our services and harm our business the value of our investment in development or business acquisitions could be reduced and third parties might make claims against us related to losses of their confidential or proprietary information in addition we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights these incidents and claims could harm our business reduce revenue increase expenses and harm our reputation 

we may be subject to claims by others that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights 

third parties may assert claims that we or our clients infringe their intellectual property rights and these claims with or without merit could be expensive to litigate cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management resources and attention in defending the claim in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can also seek injunctive relief that may limit the operation of our business or prevent the marketing and selling of our services that infringe on the plaintiff’s intellectual property rights to resolve these claims we may enter into licensing agreements with restrictive terms or significant fees stop selling be required to implement costly redesigns to the affected services or pay damages to satisfy contractual obligations to others if we do not resolve these claims in advance of a trial there is no guarantee that we will be successful in court these outcomes may have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition certain contracts with our suppliers or clients contain provisions whereby we indemnify subject to certain limitations the counterparty for damages suffered as a result of claims related to intellectual property infringement and the use of data claims made under these provisions could be expensive to litigate and could result in significant payments 

we rely on licenses from third parties to certain technology and intellectual property rights for some of our services and the licenses we currently have could terminate or expire 

some of our business services rely on technology or intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others our licenses to this technology or these intellectual property rights could be terminated or could expire we may be unable to replace these licenses in a timely manner failure to renew these licenses or renewals of these licenses on less advantageous terms could harm our operating results and financial condition 

our financial results may be adversely affected if we underprice our contracts overrun our cost estimates or fail to receive approval for or experience delays in documenting change orders 

most of our research  development solutions contracts are either fee for service contracts or fixedfee contracts our past financial results have been and our future financial results may be adversely impacted if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates and are unable to successfully negotiate a change order change orders typically occur when the scope of work we perform needs to be modified from that originally contemplated by our contract with the client modifications can occur for example when there is a change in a key clinical trial assumption or parameter or a significant change in timing where we are not successful in converting outofscope work into change orders under our current contracts we bear the cost of the additional work such underpricing significant cost overruns or delay in documentation of change orders could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

the relationship of backlog to revenues varies over time 

backlog represents future revenues for our research  development solutions business from work not yet completed or performed under signed binding commitments and signed contracts once work begins on a project revenue is recognized over the duration of the project projects may be terminated or delayed by the client or delayed by regulatory authorities for reasons beyond our control to the extent projects are delayed the timing of our revenue could be affected in the event that a client cancels a contract we typically would be entitled to receive payment for all services performed up to the cancellation date and subsequent clientauthorized services related to terminating the canceled project typically however we have no contractual right to the full amount of the revenue reflected in our backlog in the event of a contract cancellation the duration of the projects included in our backlog and the related revenue recognition range from a few weeks to many years our backlog may not be indicative of our future revenues from our research  development solutions business and we may not realize all the anticipated future revenue reflected in our backlog a number of factors may affect backlog including 

• the size complexity and duration of the projects 

• the percentage of full services versus functional services 

• the cancellation or delay of projects and 

• change in the scope of work during the course of a project 

although an increase in backlog will generally result in an increase in revenues to be recognized over time depending on the level of cancellations an increase in backlog at a particular point in time does not necessarily correspond directly to an increase in revenues during a particular period the extent to which contracts in backlog will result in revenue depends on many factors including but not limited to delivery against projected schedules the need for scope changes change orders contract cancellations and the nature duration size complexity and phase of the contracts each of which factors can vary significantly from time to time 

the rate at which our backlog converts to revenue may vary over time for a variety of reasons the revenue recognition on larger more global projects could be slower than on smaller less global projects for a variety of reasons including but not limited to an extended period of negotiation between the time the project is awarded to us and the actual execution of the contract as well as an increased timeframe for obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals additionally the increased complexity of the drug development pipeline and the need to enroll precise patient populations could extend the length of clinical trials causing revenue to be recognized over a longer period of time further delayed projects will remain in backlog unless otherwise canceled by the client and will not generate revenue at the rate originally expected thus the relationship of backlog to realized revenues may vary over time 

our business depends on the continued effectiveness and availability of our information systems including the information systems we use to provide our services to our clients and failures of these systems may materially limit our operations 

due to the global nature of our business and our reliance on information systems to provide our services we intend to increase our use of webenabled and other integrated information systems in delivering our services we also provide access to similar information systems to certain of our clients in connection with the services we provide them as the breadth and complexity of our information systems continue to grow we will increasingly be exposed to the risks inherent in the development integration and ongoing operation of evolving information systems including 

• disruption impairment or failure of data centers telecommunications facilities or other key infrastructure platforms 

• security breaches of cyberattacks on and other failures or malfunctions in our critical application systems or their associated hardware and 

• excessive costs excessive delays or other deficiencies in systems development and deployment 

the materialization of any of these risks may impede the processing of data the delivery of databases and services and the daytoday management of our business and could result in the corruption loss or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary confidential or other data while we have disaster recovery plans in place they might not adequately protect us in the event of a system failure while many of our operations have disaster recovery plans in place we currently do not have excess or standby computer processing or network capacity everywhere in the world to avoid disruption in the receipt processing and delivery of data in the event of a system failure despite any precautions we take damage from fire floods hurricanes power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses breakins and similar events at our various computer facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to our servers and from our servers to our clients corruption or loss of data may result in the need to repeat a clinical trial at no cost to the client but at significant cost to us the termination of a contract or damage to our reputation 

in addition any failure by our computer environment to provide sufficient processing or network capacity to transfer data could result in interruptions in our service in the event of a delay in the delivery of data we could be required to transfer our data collection operations to an alternative provider of server hosting services such a transfer could result in significant delays in our ability to deliver services to our clients and increase our costs additionally significant delays in system enhancements or inadequate performance of new or upgraded systems once completed could damage our reputation and harm our business finally longterm disruptions in the infrastructure caused by events such as natural disasters the outbreak of war the escalation of hostilities and acts of terrorism particularly involving cities in which we have offices could adversely affect our businesses although we carry property and business interruption insurance our coverage might not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur 

we have continued to undertake significant programs to optimize business processes with respect to our services our inability to effectively manage the implementation and adapt to new processes designed into new or upgraded systems in a timely and costeffective manner may result in disruption to our business and negatively affect our operations 

we have entered into agreements with certain vendors to provide systems development and integration services that develop or license to us the it platform for programs to optimize our business processes if such vendors fail to perform as required or if there are substantial delays in developing implementing and updating the it platform our client delivery may be impaired and we may have to make substantial further investments internally or with third parties to achieve our objectives additionally our progress may be limited by parties with existing or claimed patents who seek to enjoin us from using preferred technology or seek license payments from us meeting our objectives is dependent on a number of factors which may not take place as we anticipate including obtaining adequate technologyenabled services creating itenabled services that our clients will find desirable and implementing our business model with respect to these services also increased itrelated expenditures may negatively impact our profitability 

we may experience challenges with the acquisition development enhancement or deployment of technology necessary for our business 

we operate in businesses that require sophisticated computer systems and software for data collection data processing cloudbased platforms analytics cryptography statistical projections and forecasting mobile computing social media analytics and other applications and technologies particularly in our technology  analytics solutions and research  development solutions businesses we seek to address our technology risks by increasing our reliance on the use of innovations by crossindustry technology leaders and adapt these for our biopharmaceutical and healthcare industry clients some of these technologies supporting the industries we serve are changing rapidly and we must continue to adapt to these changes in a timely and effective manner at an acceptable cost we also must continue to deliver data to our clients in forms that are easy to use while simultaneously providing clear answers to complex questions there can be no guarantee that we will be able to develop acquire or integrate new technologies that these new technologies will meet our needs or those of our clients’ needs or achieve expected investment goals or that we will be able to do so as quickly or costeffectively as our competitors significant technological change could render certain of our services obsolete moreover the introduction of new services embodying new technologies could render certain of our existing services obsolete our continued success will depend on our ability to adapt to changing technologies manage and process everincreasing amounts of data and information and improve the performance features and reliability of our services in response to changing client and industry demands we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful design development testing introduction or marketing of our services new services or enhancements to existing services may not adequately meet our own requirements or those of current and prospective clients or achieve any degree of significant market acceptance these types of failures could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and reputation 

consolidation in the industries in which our clients operate may reduce the volume of services purchased by consolidated clients following an acquisition or merger which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 

mergers or consolidations among our clients have in the past and could in the future reduce the number of our clients and potential clients when companies consolidate overlapping services previously purchased separately are usually purchased only once by the combined entity leading to loss of revenue other services that were previously purchased by one of the merged or consolidated entities may be deemed unnecessary or cancelled if our clients merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services there can be no assurance as to the degree to which we may be able to address the revenue impact of such consolidation any of these developments could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by client or therapeutic concentration 

although we did not have any client that represented 10 or more of our revenues in 2021 2020 and 2019 we derive the majority of our revenues from a number of large clients if any large client decreases or terminates its relationship with us our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

additionally conducting multiple clinical trials for different clients in a single therapeutic class involving drugs with the same or similar chemical action has in the past and may in the future adversely affect our business if some or all of the clinical trials are canceled because of new scientific information or regulatory judgments that affect the drugs as a class or if industry consolidation results in the rationalization of drug development pipelines similarly marketing and selling drugs for different biopharmaceutical companies with similar chemical actions subjects us to risk if new scientific information or regulatory judgment prejudices the drugs as a class which may lead to compelled or voluntary prescription limitations or withdrawal of some or all of such drugs from the market 

our business is subject to international economic political and other risks that could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we have significant operations in countries that may require complex arrangements to deliver services throughout the world for our clients additionally we have established operations in locations remote from our most developed business centers as a result we are subject to heightened risks inherent in conducting business internationally including the following 

• required compliance with a variety of local laws and regulations which may be materially different than those to which we are subject in the united states or which may change unexpectedly for example conducting a single clinical trial across multiple countries is complex and issues in one country such as a failure to comply with local regulations or restrictions may affect the progress of the clinical trial in the other countries for example by limiting the amount of data necessary for a clinical trial to proceed resulting in delays or potential cancellation of contracts which in turn may result in loss of revenue 

• the united states or foreign countries could enact legislation or impose regulations or other restrictions including unfavorable labor regulations tax policies or economic sanctions which could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business in or expatriate profits from the countries in which we operate including hiring retaining and overseeing qualified management personnel for managing operations in multiple countries differing employment practices and labor issues and taxrelated risks including the imposition of taxes and the lack of beneficial treaties that result in a higher effective tax rate for us 

• foreign countries are expanding or may expand their regulatory framework with respect to patient informed consent protection and compensation in clinical trials which could delay or inhibit our ability to conduct clinical trials in such jurisdictions 

• the regulatory or judicial authorities of foreign countries may not enforce legal rights and recognize business procedures in a manner in which we are accustomed or would reasonably expect 

• local economic political and social conditions including potential hyperinflationary conditions political instability and potential nationalization repatriation expropriation price controls or other restrictive government actions including changes in political and economic conditions may lead to changes in the business environment in which we operate as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

• immigration laws are subject to legislative change and varying standards of application and enforcement due to political forces economic conditions or other events including proposals in the us to change limitations on temporary and permanent workers and local immigration laws may require us to meet certain other legal requirements as a condition to obtaining or maintaining entry visas which may impact our ability to provide services to our clients 

• potential violations of local laws or antibribery laws such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and the uk bribery act may cause difficulty in managing foreign operations as well as significant consequences to us if those laws are violated 

• regulatory changes and economic conditions following the uk’s exit from the eu “brexit” including uncertainties as to its effect on trade laws tariffs instability and volatility in the global financial and currency markets conflicting or redundant regulatory regimes in europe and political stability 

• clients in foreign jurisdictions may have longer payment cycles and it may be more difficult to collect receivables in foreign jurisdictions and 

• natural disasters public health emergencies and pandemics such as the covid19 including any variants or international conflict including terrorist acts could interrupt our services endanger our personnel lower patient visits and increase patient dropout rates cause delays in recruitment of new patients decrease the productivity of our clinical research associates cause other project delays or loss of clinical trial materials or results 

these risks and uncertainties could negatively impact our ability to among other things perform large global projects for our clients furthermore our ability to deal with these issues could be affected by applicable united states laws and the need to protect our assets any such risks could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

climate change may have an impact on our business 

while we have determined that at this time climate change does not present a material risk to our business given the nature of our activities we continue to evaluate and mitigate our business risks associated with climate change and we recognize that there are inherent climaterelated risks wherever business is conducted any of our office or it systems locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change furthermore climate change may impact patients in our clinical trials and our employees particularly where they work remotely changing market dynamics global policy developments and the increasing frequency and impact of extreme weather events on critical infrastructure have the potential to disrupt our business the business of our thirdparty suppliers and the business of our customers and may cause us to experience losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations 

exchange rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial condition 

because a large portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar and our financial statements are reported in united states dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition exchange rate fluctuations between local currencies and the united states dollar create risk in several ways including 

• foreign currency translation risk the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies and translated into united states dollars for financial reporting purposes accordingly exchange rate fluctuations will affect the translation of foreign results into united states dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated results 

• foreign currency transaction risk we are subject to foreign currency transaction risk for fluctuations in exchange rates during the period of time between the consummation and cash settlement of a transaction we earn revenue from our service contracts over a period of several months and in some cases over several years accordingly exchange rate fluctuations during this period may affect our profitability with respect to such contracts 

we may limit these risks through exchange rate fluctuation provisions stated in our service contracts or we may hedge our transaction risk with foreign currency exchange contracts or options we have not however hedged all of our foreign currency transaction risk and we may experience fluctuations in financial results from our operations outside the united states and foreign currency transaction risk associated with our service contracts 

due to the global nature of our business we may be exposed to liabilities under anticorruption laws including the united states foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and various international anticorruption laws and any allegation or determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are required to comply with the fcpa the uk bribery act and other international anticorruption laws which prohibit companies from engaging in bribery including corruptly or improperly offering promising or providing money or anything else of value to nonunited states officials and certain other recipients in addition the fcpa imposes certain books records and accounting control obligations on public companies and other issuers we operate in parts of the world in which corruption can be common and compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices our global operations face the risk of unauthorized payments or offers being made by employees consultants sales agents and other business partners outside of our control or without our authorization it is our policy to implement safeguards to prohibit these practices by our employees and business partners with respect to our operations however irrespective of these safeguards or as a result of monitoring compliance with such safeguards it is possible that we or certain other parties may discover or receive information at some point that certain employees consultants sales agents or other business partners may have engaged in corrupt conduct for which we might be held responsible violations of the fcpa the uk bribery act or other international anticorruption laws may result in restatements of or irregularities in our financial statements as well as severe criminal or civil sanctions and we may be subject to other liabilities which could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition in some cases companies that violate the fcpa may be debarred by the united states government andor lose their united states export privileges changes in anticorruption laws or enforcement priorities could also result in increased compliance requirements and related costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition the united states or other governments may seek to hold us liable for successor liability fcpa violations or violations of other anticorruption laws committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquired or will acquire 

we face risks related to sales to government entities 

we derive a portion of our revenue from sales to government entities in the united states in general our contracts with united states government entities are terminable at will by the government entity at any time government demand and payment for our services may be affected by publicsector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations including government shutdowns government contracts are subject to oversight including special rules on accounting expenses reviews and security failure to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions including termination of contracts fines and suspensions or debarment from future business with the united states government as a result failure to comply with these rules could have an adverse effect on our future business reputation operating results and financial condition 

if we are unable to successfully develop and market new services or enter new markets our growth results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

a key element of our growth strategy is the successful development and marketing of new services or entering new markets that complement or expand our existing business as we develop new services or enter new markets including services targeted at participants in the broader healthcare industry we may not have or adequately build the competencies necessary to perform such services satisfactorily may not receive market acceptance for such services or may face increased competition if we are unable to succeed in developing new services entering new markets or attracting a client base for our new services or in new markets we will be unable to implement this element of our growth strategy and our future business reputation results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our research  development solutions business could subject us to potential liability that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our research  development solutions business involves the testing of new drugs on patients in clinical trials and if marketing approval is granted the availability of these drugs to be prescribed to patients our involvement in the clinical trials and development process creates a risk of liability for personal injury to or death of patients particularly those with lifethreatening illnesses resulting from adverse reactions to the drugs administered during testing or after product launch respectively for example we have from time to time been sued and may be sued in the future by individuals alleging personal injury due to their participation in clinical trials and seeking damages from us under a variety of legal theories although we maintain the types and amounts of insurance we view as customary in the industries and countries in which we operate if we are required to pay damages or incur defense costs in connection with any personal injury claim that is outside the scope of indemnification agreements we have with our clients if any indemnification agreement is not performed in accordance with its terms or if our liability exceeds the amount of any applicable indemnification limits or available insurance coverage our financial condition results of operations and reputation could be materially and adversely affected we maintain professional liability insurance including liability for completed operations coverage in the future we may not be able to get adequate insurance for these types of risks at reasonable rates 

we also contract with physicians to serve as investigators in conducting clinical trials if the investigators commit errors or make omissions during a clinical trial that result in harm to clinical trial patients or after a clinical trial to a patient using the drug after it has received regulatory approval claims for personal injury or liability damages may result additionally if the investigators engage in fraudulent behavior clinical trial data may be compromised which may require us to repeat the clinical trial or subject us to liability we do not believe we are legally responsible for the medical care rendered by such thirdparty investigators and we would vigorously defend any claims brought against us however it is possible we could be found liable for claims with respect to the actions of thirdparty investigators which may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

some of our services involve direct interaction with clinical trial subjects or volunteers and subcontracting into a network of phase i clinical facilities which could create potential liability that may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and reputation 

we subcontract into a network of facilities where phase i clinical trials are conducted which ordinarily involve testing an investigational drug on a limited number of healthy individuals typically 20 to 80 persons to determine such drug’s basic safety failure to operate such a facility in accordance with applicable regulations could result in that facility being shut down which could disrupt our operations additionally we face risks associated with adverse events resulting from the administration of such drugs to healthy volunteers and the professional malpractice of medical care providers any professional malpractice or negligence by such investigators nurses or other subcontracted employees could potentially result in liability to us in the event of personal injury to or death of a healthy volunteer in clinical trials and could also cause us reputational harm this liability particularly if it were to exceed the limits of any indemnification agreements and insurance coverage we may have may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

our contract sales  medical solutions business could result in liability to us if a drug causes harm to a patient while we are generally indemnified and insured against such risks we may still suffer financial losses 

when we market drugs under contract for a biopharmaceutical company we could suffer liability for harm allegedly caused by those drugs either as a result of a lawsuit against the biopharmaceutical company to which we are joined a lawsuit naming us or any of our subsidiaries or an action launched by a regulatory body while we are generally indemnified by the biopharmaceutical company for the action of the drugs we market on its behalf and we carry insurance to cover harm caused by our negligence in performing services it is possible that we could nonetheless incur financial losses regulatory penalties or both in particular any claim could result in potential liability for us if the claim is outside the scope of the indemnification agreement we have with the biopharmaceutical company the biopharmaceutical company does not abide by the indemnification agreement as required or the liability exceeds the amount of any applicable indemnification limits or available insurance coverage such a finding could have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and reputation furthermore negative publicity associated with harm caused by drugs we helped to market could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

our insurance may not cover all of our indemnification obligations and other liabilities associated with our operations 

we maintain insurance designed to provide coverage for ordinary risks associated with our operations and our ordinary indemnification obligations the coverage provided by such insurance may not be adequate for all claims we may make or may be contested by our insurance carriers if our insurance is not adequate or available to pay liabilities associated with our operations or if we are unable to purchase adequate insurance at reasonable rates in the future our profitability may be adversely impacted 

if we are unable to attract suitable investigators and patients for our clinical trials our clinical development business might suffer 

the timely recruitment of investigators and patients for clinical trials is essential to our research  development solutions business investigators are typically located at hospitals clinics or other sites and supervise the administration of the investigational drug to patients during the course of a clinical trial patients generally include people from the communities in which the clinical trials are conducted our clinical development business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract suitable and willing investigators or patients for clinical trials on a consistent basis for example if we are unable to engage investigators to conduct clinical trials as planned or enroll sufficient patients in clinical trials we might need to expend additional funds to obtain access to resources or else be compelled to delay or modify the clinical trial plans which may result in additional costs to us 

if we lose the services of key personnel or experience sustained labor shortages and are unable to recruit additional qualified personnel or we are required to substantially increase wage rates to attract or retain employees our business could be adversely affected 

our success substantially depends on the collective performance contributions and expertise of our personnel including senior management and key personnel qualified professional scientific and technical operating staff and qualified sales representatives for our contract sales services there is significant and increasing competition for qualified personnel particularly those with higher educational degrees such as a medical degree a phd or an equivalent degree or relevant experience in the industry including highly technical specialties such as clinical research associates project managers and technology developers and in the locations in which we operate this increase in competition and shortage of qualified personnel in certain specialty areas may make it more difficult to hire and retain our key employees and could result in substantial increased costs such as increased wage rates to attract and retain employees the departure of our key employees or our inability to continue to identify attract and retain qualified personnel or replace departed personnel in a timely fashion may impact our ability to grow our business and compete effectively in our industry and may negatively affect our ability to meet financial and operational goals 

disruptions in the credit and capital markets and unfavorable general economic conditions could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

disruptions in the credit and capital markets could have negative effects on our business that may be difficult to predict or anticipate including the ability of our clients vendors contractors and financing sources to meet their contractual obligations although we are unable to quantify the impact it has had on us we are aware of a limited number of instances in our research  development solutions business during the past several years where cancellations changes in scope and failure to pay timely were attributable at least in part to difficulty in our clients’ ability to obtain financing in the future such actions by our clients could if they involve a significant amount of business with us have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our effective income tax rate may fluctuate for a variety of reasons which may adversely affect our operations earnings and earnings per share 

our effective income tax rate is influenced by our projected profitability in the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate changes in a jurisdiction’s income tax rates and the distribution of our profits and losses among such jurisdictions may have a significant impact on our effective income tax rate which in turn could have an adverse effect on our net income and earnings per share other factors that may affect our effective income tax rate include but are not limited to 

• changes in the value of deferred tax assets and liabilities 

• changes in tax laws in various jurisdictions 

• audits by taxing authorities and 

• the establishment of valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets if we determined that it is more likely than not that future income tax benefits will not be realized 

in addition our effective income tax rate is influenced by us tax law which has been substantially modified by the tax cuts and jobs act enacted in 2017 “tax act” in the course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain which may require the use of estimates and significant judgement to account for their impact on the effective income tax rate in our consolidated financial statements as the regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tax act our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

all of these items described above may cause fluctuations in our effective income tax rate through increased us tax liability andor the loss of tax attributes in any given year that could adversely affect our results of operations and impact our earnings and earnings per share additional information regarding our income taxes is presented in note 16 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” or other standardsetting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements 

we are required to prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” which is periodically revised andor expanded from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the fasb and the sec it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt such as amended guidance for income taxes may require additional changes to the current accounting treatment that we apply to our financial statements and may require us to make significant changes to our reporting systems such changes could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

our relationships with existing or potential clients who are in competition with each other may adversely impact the degree to which other clients or potential clients use our services which may adversely affect our results of operations 

the biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive with biopharmaceutical companies each seeking to persuade payers providers and patients that their drug therapies are better and more costeffective than competing therapies marketed or being developed by competing firms in addition to the adverse competitive interests that biopharmaceutical companies have with each other biopharmaceutical companies also have adverse interests with respect to drug selection and reimbursement with other participants in the healthcare industry including payers and providers biopharmaceutical companies also compete to be first to market with new drug therapies we regularly provide services to biopharmaceutical companies who compete with each other and we sometimes provide services or funding to such clients regarding competing drugs in development our existing or future relationships with our biopharmaceutical clients may therefore deter other biopharmaceutical clients from using our services or may result in our clients seeking to place limits on our ability to serve other biopharmaceutical industry participants in connection with drug development activities in addition our further expansion into the broader healthcare market may adversely impact our relationships with biopharmaceutical clients and such clients may elect not to use our services reduce the scope of services that we provide to them or seek to place restrictions on our ability to serve clients in the broader healthcare market with interests that are adverse to theirs a loss of clients or reductions in the level of revenues from a client could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations business and prospects 

if we are unable to successfully identify acquire and integrate existing businesses services and technologies our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 

we anticipate that a portion of our future growth may come from acquiring existing businesses services or technologies the success of any acquisition will depend upon among other things our ability to effectively integrate acquired personnel operations services and technologies into our business and to retain the key personnel and clients of our acquired businesses in addition we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or obtain any necessary financing on commercially acceptable terms we may also spend time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition targets but not complete the transaction any future acquisition could involve other risks including among others the assumption of additional liabilities and expenses difficulties and expenses in connection with integrating the acquired companies and achieving the expected benefits issuances of potentially dilutive securities or interestbearing debt loss of key employees of the acquired companies transaction costs diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and with respect to the acquisition of foreign companies the inability to overcome differences in foreign business practices language and customs our failure to identify potential acquisitions complete targeted acquisitions and integrate completed acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our results of operations may be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our goodwill and intangible assets 

we assess the realizability of our indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill annually and conduct an interim evaluation whenever events or changes in circumstances such as operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset indicate that these assets may be impaired our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of the businesses we have acquired which in turn could depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses into our own business if we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets such impairment charges could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we face risks arising from the restructuring of our operations 

from time to time we have adopted restructuring plans to improve our operating efficiency through various means such as reduction of overcapacity elimination of nonbillable support roles or other realignment of resources restructuring presents significant potential risks of events occurring that could adversely affect us including 

• actual or perceived disruption of service or reduction in service standards to clients 

• the failure to preserve supplier relationships and distribution sales and other important relationships and to resolve conflicts that may arise 

• loss of sales as we reduce or eliminate staffing on noncore services 

• diversion of management attention from ongoing business activities and 

• the failure to maintain employee morale and retain key employees 

further any such restructuring would result in charges that if material could harm our results of operations and significantly reduce our cash position or increase debt in addition we may incur certain unforeseen costs once any restructuring activities are implemented further if we determine to effect any restructuring we can give no assurance that any projected cost reductions resulting from such restructuring activities will be achieved within the expected timeframe or at all 

because of these and other factors we cannot predict whether we will realize the purpose and anticipated benefits of these measures and if we do not our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

additionally there may be delays in implementing the restructuring activities or a failure to achieve the anticipated levels of cost savings and efficiency as a result of the restructuring activities each of which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations further restructuring or reorganization activities may also be required in the future beyond what is currently planned which could further enhance the risks associated with these activities 

risks relating to our industry 

the biopharmaceutical services industry is highly competitive 

the biopharmaceutical services industry is highly competitive our business often competes with other biopharmaceutical services companies internal discovery departments development departments sales and marketing departments information technology departments and other departments within our clients some of which could be considered large biopharmaceutical services companies in their own right with greater resources than ours we also compete with universities teaching hospitals governments agencies and others if we do not compete successfully our business will suffer the biopharmaceutical services industry is highly fragmented with numerous smaller specialized companies and a handful of companies with global capabilities similar to certain of our own capabilities increased competition has led to price and other forms of competition such as acceptance of less favorable contract terms that could adversely affect our operating results there are few barriers to entry for companies considering offering any one or more of the services we offer because of their size and focus these companies might compete effectively against us which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our future growth and success will depend on our ability to successfully compete with other companies that provide similar services in the same markets some of which may have financial marketing technical and other advantages we also expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of consolidation among these various companies large technology companies with substantial resources technical expertise and greater brand power could also decide to enter or further expand in the markets where our business operates and compete with us if one or more of our competitors or potential competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors or if a new entrant emerged with substantial resources the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively we compete on the basis of various factors including breadth and depth of services reputation reliability quality geographic coverage innovation security price and industry expertise and experience in addition our ability to compete successfully may be impacted by the growing availability of health information from social media government health information systems and other free or lowcost sources consolidation or integration of wholesalers retail pharmacies health networks payers or other healthcare stakeholders may lead any of them to provide information services directly to clients or indirectly through a designated service provider resulting in increased competition from firms that may have lower costs to market eg no data supply costs any of the above may result in lower demand for our services which could result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

outsourcing trends in the biopharmaceutical industry and changes in aggregate spending and research and development budgets could adversely affect our operating results and growth rate 

economic factors and industry trends that affect biopharmaceutical companies affect our research  development solutions business biopharmaceutical companies continue to seek longterm strategic collaborations with global clinical research organizations with favorable pricing terms competition for these collaborations is intense and we may decide to forego an opportunity or we may not be selected in which case a competitor may enter into the collaboration and our business with the client if any may be limited in addition if the biopharmaceutical industry reduces its research  development solutions activities or reduces its outsourcing of clinical trials and sales and marketing projects or such outsourcing fails to grow at projected rates our operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected we may also be negatively impacted by consolidation and other factors in the biopharmaceutical industry which may slow decision making by our clients or result in the delay or cancellation of clinical trials our commercial services may be affected by reductions in new drug launches and increases in the number of drugs losing patent protection all of these events could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our business may be materially and adversely impacted by factors affecting the biopharmaceutical and healthcare industries 

the vast majority of our revenue is generated from sales to the biopharmaceutical and healthcare industries the clients we serve in these industries are commonly subject to financial pressures including but not limited to increased costs reduced demand for their products reductions in pricing and reimbursement for products and services formulary approval and placement government approval to market their products and limits on the manner by which they market their products loss of patent exclusivity whether due to patent expiration or as a result of a successful legal challenge and the proliferation of or changes to regulations applicable to these industries to the extent our clients face such pressures or they change how they utilize our offerings the demand for our services or the prices our clients are willing to pay for those services may decline any such decline could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we may be affected by healthcare reform and potential additional reforms 

the united states congress continues to consider healthcare reform legislation and impose health industry cost containment measures which may significantly impact the biopharmaceutical industry in addition numerous government bodies are considering or have adopted various healthcare reforms and may undertake or are in the process of undertaking efforts to control growing healthcare costs through legislation regulation and voluntary agreements with medical care providers and biopharmaceutical companies we are uncertain as to the effects of these recent reforms on our business and are unable to predict what legislative proposals if any will be adopted in the future if regulatory cost containment efforts limit the profitability of new drugs our clients may reduce their research and development spending or promotional marketing and sales expenditures which could reduce the business they outsource to us similarly if regulatory requirements are relaxed or simplified drug approval procedures are adopted the demand for our services could decrease 

foreign and domestic government bodies may also adopt healthcare legislation or regulations that are more burdensome than existing regulations for example product safety concerns and recommendations by the drug safety oversight board could change the regulatory environment for drug products and new or heightened regulatory and licensing requirements may increase our expenses or limit or delay our ability to offer some of our services additionally new or heightened regulatory requirements may have a negative impact on the ability of our clients to conduct industrysponsored clinical trials which could reduce the need for our services 

actions by government regulators or clients to limit a prescription’s scope or withdraw an approved drug from the market could adversely affect our business and result in a loss of revenues 

government regulators have the authority after approving a drug to regulate or limit its scope of prescription or withdraw it from the market completely based on safety concerns similarly clients may act to voluntarily limit the scope of prescription of drugs or withdraw them from the market in the past we have provided services with respect to drugs that have been limited andor withdrawn if we are providing services to clients for drugs that are limited or withdrawn we may be required to narrow the scope of or terminate our services with respect to such drugs which would prevent earning the full amount of revenues anticipated under the related service contracts with negative impacts to our financial results 

if we do not keep pace with rapid technological changes our services may become less competitive or obsolete 

the biopharmaceutical industry is subject to rapid technological changes our current competitors or other businesses might develop technologies or services that are more effective or commercially attractive than or render obsolete our current or future technologies and services if our competitors introduce superior technologies or services including in the provision of clinical services and if we cannot make enhancements to remain competitive our competitive position would be harmed if we are unable to compete successfully we may lose clients or be unable to attract new clients which could lead to a decrease in our revenue and financial condition 

laws restricting biopharmaceutical sales and marketing practices may adversely impact demand for our services 

there have been a significant number of laws legislative initiatives and regulatory actions over the years that seek to limit biopharmaceutical sales and marketing practices for example three states in 2006 and 2007 passed laws restricting the use of prescriber identifiable information for the purpose of promoting branded prescription medicines although these laws were subsequently declared to be unconstitutional based on a decision of the us supreme court in sorrell v ims health in 2011 we are unable to predict whether and in what form other initiatives may be introduced or actions taken at the state or federal levels to limit biopharmaceutical sales and marketing practices in addition while we will continue to seek to adapt our services to comply with the requirements of these laws to the extent applicable to our services if enacted there can be no assurance that our efforts to adapt our offerings will be successful and provide the same financial contribution to us there can also be no assurance that future legislative initiatives will not adversely affect our ability to develop or market current or future offerings or that any future laws will not diminish the demand for our services all of which could over time result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

our research  development solutions clients face intense competition from lower cost generic products which may lower the amount that they spend on our services 

our research  development solutions clients face increasing competition from lower cost generic products which in turn may affect their ability to pursue research and development activities with us in the united states eu and japan political pressure to reduce spending on prescription drugs has led to legislation and other measures which encourages the use of generic products in addition proposals emerge from time to time in the united states and other countries for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by generic substitutes reducing our clients’ sales of that product and their overall profitability availability of generic substitutes for our clients’ drugs may adversely affect their results of operations and cash flow which in turn may mean that they would not have surplus capital to invest in research and development and drug commercialization including in our services if competition from generic products impacts our clients’ finances such that they decide to curtail our services our revenues may decline and this could have a material adverse effect on our business 

risks relating to our indebtedness 

restrictions imposed in the senior secured credit facilities as defined below and other outstanding indebtedness including the indentures governing outstanding notes issued by our wholly owned subsidiary iqvia inc may limit our ability to operate our business and to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 

the terms of the senior secured credit facilities restrict iqvia and its restricted subsidiaries from engaging in specified types of transactions these covenants restrict the ability of iqvia and its restricted subsidiaries among other things to 

• incur liens 

• make investments and loans 

• incur indebtedness or guarantees 

• issue preferred stock of a restricted subsidiary 

• issue disqualified equity 

• engage in mergers acquisitions and asset sales 

• declare dividends make payments or redeem or repurchase equity interests 

• alter the business iqvia and its restricted subsidiaries conduct 

• make restricted payments 

• enter into agreements limiting restricted subsidiary distributions 

• prepay redeem or purchase certain indebtedness and 

• engage in certain transactions with affiliates 

in addition the revolving credit facility and the term a and b loans under the fifth amended and restated credit agreement as defined below require iqvia to comply with a quarterly maximum senior secured net leverage ratio test and minimum interest coverage ratio test iqvia’s ability to comply with these financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and iqvia may not be able to satisfy them additionally the restrictions contained in the indentures governing the outstanding notes could also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions meet capital needs or make acquisitions or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facilities or the indentures governing the outstanding notes which could trigger acceleration of our indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of or default under any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial results in the event of any default under the senior secured credit facilities the applicable lenders could elect to terminate borrowing commitments and declare all borrowings and loans outstanding together with accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and other obligations to be due and payable in addition or in the alternative the applicable lenders could exercise their rights under the security documents entered into in connection with the senior secured credit facilities iqvia and the other subsidiary guarantors have pledged substantially all of their tangible and intangible assets subject to customary exceptions as collateral under the senior secured credit facilities including the stock and the assets of certain of our current and future wholly owned united states subsidiaries and a portion of the stock of certain of our nonunited states subsidiaries 

if we were unable to repay or otherwise refinance these borrowings and loans when due the applicable lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation in the event the applicable lenders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness any acceleration of amounts due under the fifth amended and restated credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities or the exercise by the applicable lenders of their rights under the security documents would likely have a material adverse effect on us 

despite our level of indebtedness we are able to incur more debt and undertake additional obligations incurring such debt or undertaking such additional obligations could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition 

although the fifth amended and restated credit agreement which governs the senior secured credit facilities of our wholly owned subsidiary through which we conduct our operations iqvia inc contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could increase in addition the receivables financing facility for one of our consolidated subsidiaries a bankruptcyremote special purpose entity the “spe” limits borrowing based on the amount of receivables purchased by the spe from certain of our other subsidiaries but when supported by the value of such purchased receivables the debt under our receivables financing facility can increase 

while the fifth amended and restated credit agreement also contains restrictions on our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to make loans and investments these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the investments incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 

restrictive covenants in our other indebtedness may limit our flexibility in our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to pursue our business strategies 

the terms contained in certain of our indebtedness including credit facilities and any future indebtedness of ours may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions including restrictions on our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to take actions that we believe may be in our interest these agreements among other things limit our ability to 

• incur additional debt 

• provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons 

• issue redeemable stock and preferred stock 

• pay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock 

• prepay redeem or repurchase debt 

• make loans investments and capital expenditures 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

• create or incur liens 

• make distributions from our subsidiaries 

• sell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries 

• make acquisitions and 

• consolidate or merge with or into or sell substantially all of our assets to another person 

a breach of the covenants or restrictions under the agreements governing our other indebtedness could result in a default under the applicable indebtedness such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in the event our lenders and noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we cannot assure that we and our subsidiaries would have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness 

our financial results our substantial indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of future financing 

interest rate fluctuations and our ability to deduct interest expense may affect our results of operations and financial condition 

because we have variable rate debt fluctuations in interest rates affect our business we attempt to minimize interest rate risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily swaps we have entered into and will continue to enter into swaps with financial institutions that have reset dates and critical terms that match those of our senior secured term loan credit facility accordingly any change in market value associated with the swaps may be offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt because we do not attempt to hedge all of our variable rate debt we may incur higher interest costs for the portion of our variable rate debt which is not hedged 

in addition the deduction for our interest expense may be limited which could have an adverse impact on our taxes and net income 

we may be adversely affected by changes in the method of determining the london interbank offered rate “libor” or the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate for our variable rate loans derivative contracts and other financial assets and liabilities 

the interest rates under our credit facilities and related interest rate swaps may be impacted by the discontinuation of libor for various currencies libor is used as a reference rate to calculate interest rates under our credit facilities in 2017 the united kingdoms financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to phase out libor in march 2021 the ice benchmark administration announced that it would cease to publish libor for us dollar borrowings after june 30 2023 the alternative reference rates committee convened by the board of governors of the federal reserve system has recommended the use of the secured overnight funding rate “sofr” as a replacement benchmark index for borrowings of us dollars our credit facilities will need to be amended to give effect to sofr as the benchmark rate with respect to our us dollardenominated term b loans market terms are still developing for loans and other products linked to sofr euribor and other benchmark replacements and there can be no assurance that rates linked to sofr euribor and other benchmark replacements or related administrative terms will be as favorable to us as those rates and terms under our existing credit facilities derivatives and other contracts 

risks relating to ownership of our common stock 

provisions of the corporate governance documents of iqvia could make an acquisition of iqvia difficult and may prevent attempts by its stockholders to replace or remove its management even if beneficial to its stockholders 

our certificate of incorporation and delaware bylaws and the general corporation law of delaware the “dgcl” contain provisions that could make it difficult for a third party to acquire iqvia even if doing so might be beneficial to its stockholders including 

• the division of the board of directors into three classes and the election of each class for threeyear terms 

• the sole ability of the board of directors to fill a vacancy created by the death or resignation of a director or the expansion of the board of directors 

• advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations 

• limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings and to take action by written consent 

• the approval of holders of at least seventyfive percent 75 of the outstanding shares of iqvia entitled to vote on any amendment alteration change addition or repeal of the delaware bylaws is required to amend alter change add to or repeal the delaware bylaws 

• the required approval of holders of at least seventyfive percent 75 of the outstanding shares of iqvia to remove directors which removal may only be for cause and 

• the ability of the board of directors to issue new series of and designate the terms of preferred stock without stockholder approval which could be used to among other things institute a rights plan that would have the effect of significantly diluting the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by the board of directors 

in addition iqvia is subject to section 203 of the dgcl regulating corporate takeovers section 203 subject to certain exceptions prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any “business combination” with any “interested stockholder” for a period of three years following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder unless 

• prior to such date the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder 

• upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder the interested stockholder owned at least 85 of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced excluding those shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers and employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer or 

• on or subsequent to such date the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders and not by written consent by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder 

in general section 203 defines “business combination” to include mergers or consolidations between a delaware corporation and an interested stockholder transactions with an interested stockholder involving the assets or stock of the corporation or its majorityowned subsidiaries and transactions which increase an interested stockholder’s percentage ownership of stock in general section 203 defines an “interested stockholder” as any entity or person beneficially owning 15 or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by stockholders to replace members of the board of directors because iqvia’s board is responsible for appointing the members of management these provisions could in turn affect any attempt to replace current members of management as a result stockholders of iqvia may lose their ability to sell their stock for a price in excess of the prevailing market price due to these protective measures and efforts by stockholders to change the direction or management of iqvia may be unsuccessful 

our operating results and share price may be volatile which could cause the value of our stockholders’ investments to decline 

our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future and such fluctuations may be significant in addition securities markets worldwide have experienced and are likely to continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could subject the market price of our shares to wide price fluctuations regardless of our operating performance our operating results and the trading price of our shares may fluctuate in response to various factors including 

• market conditions in the broader stock market 

• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly and annual financial and operating results 

• introduction of new services by us or our competitors 

• issuance of new or changed securities analysts’ reports or recommendations 

• sales or anticipated sales of large blocks of our stock 

• additions or departures of key personnel 

• regulatory or political developments 

• litigation and governmental investigations 

• changing economic conditions and 

• exchange rate fluctuations 

these and other factors many of which are beyond our control may cause our operating results and the market price for our shares to fluctuate substantially while we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares and may otherwise negatively affect the market price and liquidity of our shares in addition in the past when the market price of a stock has been volatile holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock if any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation 

since we have no current plans to pay regular cash dividends on our common stock stockholders may not receive any return on investment unless they sell their common stock for a price greater than that which they paid for it 

although we have previously declared dividends to our stockholders prior to our initial public offering in may 2013 we do not currently anticipate paying any regular cash dividends on our common stock any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board and will depend on among other things our results of operations financial condition cash requirements contractual restrictions and other factors that our board may deem relevant in addition our ability to pay dividends is and may be limited by covenants of existing and any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur including under our existing credit facilities therefore any return on investment in our common stock is solely dependent upon the appreciation of the price of our common stock on the open market which may not occur 

our certificate of incorporation contains a provision renouncing any interest and expectancy in certain corporate opportunities identified by certain parties even if such corporate opportunities are ones that we might reasonably be deemed to have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue 

our certificate of incorporation provides that iqvia renounces any interest or expectancy in the business opportunities of the tpg global llc the bain capital llc cpp investment board private holdings inc and leonard green  partners lp and their affiliates other than our company and our subsidiaries and all of their respective partners principals directors officers members managers managing directors andor employees and each such person will have no obligation to offer us such opportunities this provision applies to each of these current or former stockholders and associated parties only for so long as a nominee designated by such stockholder under the shareholders agreement continues to serve on our board of directors and no individual serving our board of directors has at any time been designated as a nominee by such stockholder under the shareholders agreement stockholders are deemed to have notice of and have consented to this provision of our certificate of incorporation 

therefore a director or officer of our company who also serves as a director officer member manager or employee of such stockholders may pursue certain business opportunities including acquisitions that may be complementary to its business and as a result such opportunities may not be available to us these potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on the business financial condition results of operations or prospects of our company if attractive corporate opportunities are allocated by such stockholders to themselves or their other affiliates instead of to us

purchases of equity securities by the issuer 

on october 30 2013 the board approved an equity repurchase program the “repurchase program” authorizing the repurchase of up to 1250 million of either our common stock or vested inthemoney employee stock options or a combination thereof the board increased the stock repurchase authorization under the repurchase program with respect to the repurchase of the companys common stock by 600 million 15 billion 20 billion 15 billion and 20 billion in 2015 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively on february 10 2022 the board increased the stock repurchase authorization under the repurchase program with respect to the repurchase of the companys common stock by an additional 20 billion which increased the total amount that has been authorized under the repurchase program to 9725 billion the repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any particular amount of common stock or vested inthemoney employee stock options and it may be modified extended suspended or discontinued at any time the timing and amount of repurchases are determined by our management based on a variety of factors such as the market price of our common stock our corporate requirements and overall market conditions purchases of our common stock may be made in open market transactions effected through a brokerdealer at prevailing market prices in block trades or in privately negotiated transactions the repurchase program for common stock does not have an expiration date in addition from time to time we have repurchased and may continue to repurchase common stock through private or other transactions outside of the repurchase program 

from inception of the repurchase program through december 31 2021 we have repurchased a total of 68 billion of our securities under the repurchase program 

during the year ended december 31 2021 we repurchased 17 million shares of our common stock for approximately 395 million under the repurchase program for additional information regarding our equity repurchases see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” and note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

as of december 31 2021 we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to approximately 05 billion of our common stock under the repurchase program the february 10 2022 20 billion increase in the stock repurchase authorization increased the remaining authorization to repurchase common stock under the repurchase program up to approximately 25 billion 

since the merger between quintiles and ims health we have repurchased 674 million shares of our common stock at an average market price per share of 10095 for an aggregate purchase price of 68 billion both under and outside of the repurchase program this includes shares withheld from employees to satisfy certain tax obligations due in connection with grants of stock under the quintiles ims holdings inc 2017 incentive and stock award plan the “plan” the plan provides for the withholding of shares to satisfy tax obligations it does not specify a maximum number of shares that can be withheld for this purpose the shares of common stock withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations may be deemed to be “issuer purchases” of shares that are required to be disclosed pursuant to this item

overview of the impact of covid19 

during 2020 the covid19 pandemic disrupted the pace of our clinical trials and offerings that rely on facetoface interactions but at the same time it accelerated change in the industry and created demand for new services the pandemic resulted in the delay but not cancellation of a number of existing and planned clinical trials both because many clinical trials were slowed or temporarily paused and because many planned clinical trials did not begin as scheduled as they were crowded out by clinical trials for covid19 vaccines and other therapies during 2021 we experienced an acceleration in business momentum as these delayed clinical trial activities began or restarted which contributed to our financial results for the year 

throughout the past year and into 2022 we have worked on a substantial number of covidrelated projects covidspecific work currently does not represent a material amount of our backlog and is executed over shorter timelines than other therapeutic work though we do anticipate that this work will continue through 2022 and potentially into 2023 and beyond there will be a need for vaccines for multiple manufacturers to meet global demand new vaccines for emerging variants of the virus alternative vaccines needed as a result of adverse safety events quality issues or manufacturing delays novel treatment programs that are targeted at specific populations and conditions and vaccine safety monitoring studies 

the pandemic has also affected our business strategy in a number of ways one of the most significant impacts on our research  development solutions business has been the acceleration of decentralized clinical trials decentralized clinical trials combine the use of remote technologies and fieldbased services to enable portions of a clinical trial to be conducted away from an investigator site this approach reduces the burden on patients of having to travel to and from investigator sites frequently and allows trials to continue to be conducted even during periods of limited access to investigator sites while the decentralized clinical trial opportunity was identified before covid19 we saw how critical those capabilities were during the pandemic and accelerated their development accordingly we invested in the use of remote technologies expanded our relationships with local laboratories and healthcare providers and established a virtual network of investigators and care professionals 

we also took the opportunity presented by the pandemic to completely rethink and revolutionize our workplace and in 2021 we implemented the iqvia future of work program this program was designed to address employee feedback for more flexibility and it will facilitate approximately 80 of our employees working in flexible arrangements reducing our physical footprint and the employee commute impact on the environment to facilitate this transition we made investments in real estate to reconfigure our office space to install the most efficient work arrangements and in technology to support our employees and ensure that we can innovate collaborate and grow successfully 

the company continues to maintain strong liquidity as of december 31 2021 cash and cash equivalents were 1366 million and the company had 100 million drawn under its 15 billion revolving credit facility as of december 31 2021 the company was in compliance with the financial covenants under its debt agreements in all material respects and does not have material uncertainty about ongoing ability to meet the covenants of our credit arrangements 

business combinations 

we have completed and will continue to consider strategic business combinations to enhance our capabilities and offerings in certain areas including various individually immaterial acquisitions during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 these transactions were accounted for as business combinations and the acquired results of operations are included in our consolidated financial information since the acquisition date see note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information with respect to these business combinations 

sources of revenue 

total revenues are comprised of revenues from the provision of our services we do not have any material product revenues 

costs and expenses 

our costs and expenses are comprised primarily of our costs of revenue reimbursed expenses and selling general and administrative expenses costs of revenue include compensation and benefits for billable employees and personnel involved in production trial monitoring data management and delivery and the costs of acquiring and processing data for our information offerings costs of staff directly involved with delivering technologyrelated services offerings and engagements related accommodations and the costs of data purchased specifically for technology services engagements and other expenses directly related to service contracts such as courier fees laboratory supplies professional services and travel expenses as noted above reimbursed expenses are comprised principally of payments to investigators who oversee clinical trials and travel expenses for our clinical monitors and sales representatives selling general and administrative expenses include costs related to sales marketing and administrative functions including human resources legal finance quality assurance compliance and general management for compensation and benefits travel professional services training and expenses for information technology facilities and depreciation and amortization 

foreign currency translation 

in 2021 approximately 35 of our revenues were denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar which represents approximately 60 currencies because a large portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and our financial statements are reported in united states dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly affect our results of operations the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies and translated into united states dollars for financial reporting purposes accordingly exchange rate fluctuations will affect the translation of foreign results into united states dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated results as a result we believe that reporting results of operations that exclude the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations on certain financial results can facilitate analysis of period to period comparisons this constant currency information assumes the same foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect for the comparable prioryear period were used in translation of the current period results 

consolidated results of operations 

for information regarding our results of operations for technology  analytics solutions research  development solutions and contract sales  medical solutions refer to “segment results of operations” later in this section 

for a discussion of our results of operations comparison for 2020 and 2019 refer to our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 filed on february 12 2021

in 2021 our revenues increased 2515 million or 221 as compared to 2020 this increase was comprised of constant currency revenue growth of approximately 2398 million or 211 reflecting a 604 million increase in technology  analytics solutions a 1752 million increase in research  development solutions and a 42 million increase in contract sales  medical solutions 

costs of revenue exclusive of depreciation and amortization 



2021 compared to 2020 

when compared to 2020 costs of revenue exclusive of depreciation and amortization in 2021 increased 1733 million or 231 this increase included a constant currency increase of approximately 1606 million or 214 comprised of a 314 million increase in technology  analytics solutions a 1267 million increase in research  development solutions and a 25 million increase in contract sales  medical solutions 

as a percent of revenues costs of revenue exclusive of depreciation and amortization in 2021 increased compared to 2020 

selling general and administrative expenses 



2021 compared to 2020 

the 175 million increase in selling general and administrative expenses in 2021 as compared to 2020 included a constant currency increase of approximately 151 million or 84 comprised of a 42 million increase in technology  analytics solutions a 32 million increase in research  development solutions a 1 million decrease in contract sales  medical solutions and a 78 million increase in general corporate and unallocated expenses 

depreciation and amortization 



the 23 million decrease in depreciation and amortization in 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily due to certain intangible assets from the merger between quintiles and ims health becoming fully amortized in 2021 offset by higher intangible asset balances as a result of acquisitions occurring in 2020 and 2021 increased amortization due to higher capitalized software balances and accelerated amortization related to intangibles impacted by the companys acquisition of quests noncontrolling interest in q 2 solutions 

restructuring costs 



the restructuring costs incurred were due to ongoing efforts to streamline our global operations the remaining actions under these plans are expected to occur throughout 2022 and are expected to consist of consolidating functional activities eliminating redundant positions and aligning resources with customer requirements 

interest income and interest expense 



interest income included interest received primarily from bank balances and investments 

interest expense during 2021 was lower than 2020 due to lower interest rates attributed to lower libor rates the refinancing of our existing term a loans and the redemption of our 3250 senior notes due 2025 which was offset by the interest expense on the issuance of our 1750 senior notes due 2026 and 2250 senior notes due 2029 see note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for more information on these transactions 

loss on extinguishment of debt 



during 2021 we recognized loss on extinguishment of debt of 26 million for fees and expenses incurred related to the refinancing of our 3250 senior notes due 2025 and prior credit agreement as discussed further in note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

other income net 



other income net for 2021 increased compared to 2020 primarily due to foreign currency gain 

income tax expense 

in 2021 we recorded a benefit of 29 million related to a 2020 us federal tax return position associated with foreign derived intangible income “fdii” and global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” tax credits also in 2021 we recorded a 9 million tax expense as a result of the us treasury department issuing final regulations on foreign tax credits 

in 2020 the us treasury department issued final regulations regarding fdii and gilti we have determined we will elect the gilti high tax exception as allowed by the final regulations and have amended our 2018 us federal consolidated income tax returns and plan to amend our 2019 us federal consolidated income tax returns resulting in a favorable impact of 26 million which we recorded in 2020 

in 2019 the us treasury department issued final regulations on the transition tax and proposed regulations on fdii which was introduced by the tax act enacted by the us government on december 22 2017 the tax act is comprehensive legislation that includes provisions that lower the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 beginning in 2018 and imposes a onetime transition tax on undistributed foreign earnings the final regulations related to the transition tax did not have a material impact as a result of the proposed fdii guidance which was subsequently finalized in 2020 we reversed the tax benefit originally recorded in 2018 by recording a tax expense of 25 million for this impact in 2019 

equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates 



equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates remained relatively consistent in 2021 compared to 2020 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 



net income attributable to noncontrolling interests included quest’s interest in q 2 solutions on april 1 2021 the company acquired the 40 noncontrolling interest in q 2 solutions from quest which resulted in a decrease in the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2021 compared to 2020 see note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional details regarding this transaction

research  development solutions 



backlog 

research  development solutions contracted backlog increased from 226 billion as of december 31 2020 to 248 billion as of december 31 2021 and we expect approximately 70 billion of this backlog to convert to revenue in the next 12 months contracted backlog was 190 billion as of december 31 2019 

backlog represents at a particular point in time future revenues from work not yet completed or performed under signed contracts once work begins on a project revenues are recognized over the duration of the project 

we believe that backlog is an indicator of future revenues but the timing of revenue will be affected by a number of factors including the variable size and duration of projects many of which are performed over several years cancellations and changes to the scope of work during the course of projects projects that have been delayed remain in backlog but the timing of the revenue generated may differ from the timing originally expected additionally projects may be terminated or delayed by the customer or delayed by regulatory authorities in the event that a client cancels a contract we typically would be entitled to receive payment for all services performed up to the cancellation date and subsequent clientauthorized services related to winding down the canceled project for more details regarding risks related to our backlog see part i item ia “risk factors—risks related to our business—the relationship of backlog to revenues varies over time”

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows in addition to operating cash flows other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include capital expenditures acquisitions investments debt service requirements equity repurchases adequacy of our revolving credit and receivables financing facilities and access to the capital markets 

we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which those funds can be accessed on a costeffective basis the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences however those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations we have and expect to transfer cash from those subsidiaries to the united states and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so 

we had a cash balance of 1366 million as of december 31 2021 385 million of which was in the united states a decrease from 1814 million as of december 31 2020 

based on our current operating plan we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents future cash flows from operations and our ability to access funds under our revolving credit and receivables financing facilities will enable us to fund our operating requirements capital expenditures contractual obligations and meet debt obligations for at least the next 12 months we regularly evaluate our debt arrangements as well as market conditions and from time to time we may explore opportunities to modify our existing debt arrangements or pursue additional financing arrangements that could result in the issuance of new debt securities by us or our affiliates we may use our existing cash cash generated from operations or dispositions of assets or businesses andor proceeds from any new financing arrangements or issuances of debt or equity securities to repay or reduce some of our outstanding obligations to repurchase shares from our stockholders or for other purposes as part of our ongoing business strategy we also continually evaluate new acquisition expansion and investment possibilities or other strategic growth opportunities as well as potential dispositions of assets or businesses as appropriate including dispositions that may cause us to recognize a loss on certain assets should we elect to pursue any such transaction we may seek to obtain debt or equity financing to facilitate those activities our ability to enter into any such potential transactions and our use of cash or proceeds is limited to varying degrees by the terms and restrictions contained in our existing debt arrangements we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to complete any such financing arrangements or other transactions on favorable terms or at all 

equity repurchase program 

on february 10 2022 the board increased the stock repurchase authorization under the repurchase program with respect to the repurchase of the companys common stock by an additional 20 billion which increased the total amount that has been authorized under the repurchase program to 9725 billion since the plan’s inception in october 2013 the repurchase program does not obligate the company to repurchase any particular amount of common stock and it may be modified extended suspended or discontinued at any time 

as of december 31 2021 the company had remaining authorization to repurchase up to approximately 05 billion of its common stock under the repurchase program the february 10 2022 20 billion increase in the stock repurchase authorization increased the remaining authorization to repurchase common stock under the repurchase program up to approximately 25 billion in addition from time to time the company has repurchased and may continue to repurchase common stock through private or other transactions outside of the repurchase program

cash flow from operating activities 



2021 compared to 2020 

cash provided by operating activities increased 983 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 the increase is primarily due to an increase in cashrelated net income 762 million an increase in advanced billings 411 million a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets 131 million and the timing of income tax and other payables 81 million offset by a decrease in accounts receivable and unbilled services 393 million and the timing of accounts payable and accrued expenses 9 million 

cash flow from investing activities 



2021 compared to 2020

contingencies 

we are exposed to certain known contingencies that are material to our investors the facts and circumstances surrounding these contingencies and a discussion of their effect on us are in note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k these contingencies may have a material effect on our liquidity capital resources or results of operations in addition even where our reserves are adequate the incurrence of any of these liabilities may have a material effect on our liquidity and the amount of cash available to us for other purposes 

we believe that we have made appropriate arrangements in respect of the future effect on us of these known contingencies we also believe that the amount of cash available to us from our operations together with cash from financing will be sufficient for us to pay any known contingencies as they become due without materially affecting our ability to conduct our operations and invest in the growth of our business 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations and commitments 

below is a summary of our future payment commitments by year under contractual obligations as of december 31 2021 



1 interest payments on our debt are based on the interest rates in effect on december 31 2021 

2 purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable pricing provisions and the approximate timing of the transactions 

3 we are currently committed to invest 139 million in private equity funds as of december 31 2021 we have funded approximately 91 million of these commitments and we have approximately 48 million remaining to be funded which has not been included in the above table as we are unable to predict when these commitments will be paid 

4 amounts represent expected future benefit payments for our pension and postretirement benefit plans as well as expected contributions for 2022 for our funded pension benefit plans we made cash contributions totaling approximately 29 million to our defined benefit plans in 2021 and we estimate that we will make contributions totaling approximately 33 million to our defined benefit plans in 2022 due to the potential impact of future plan investment performance changes in interest rates changes in other economic and demographic assumptions and changes in legislation in foreign jurisdictions we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing and amount of contributions that may be required to fund our defined benefit plans for periods beyond 2022 

5 as of december 31 2021 our liability related to uncertain income tax positions was approximately 131 million 71 million of which has not been included in the above table as we are unable to predict when these liabilities will be paid due to the uncertainties in the timing of the settlement of the income tax positions 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates and related disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes known actual results may differ from those estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

the majority of the company’s contracts within the research  development solutions segment are service contracts for clinical research that represent a single performance obligation the company provides a significant integration service resulting in a combined output which is clinical trial data that meets the relevant regulatory standards and can be used by the customer to progress to the next phase of a clinical trial or solicit approval of a treatment by the applicable regulatory body the performance obligation is satisfied over time as the output is captured in data and documentation that is available for the customer to consume over the course of the arrangement and furthers progress of the clinical trial the company recognizes revenue over time using a costbased input method since there is no single output measure that would fairly depict the transfer of control over the life of the performance obligation progress on the performance obligation is measured by the proportion of actual costs incurred to the total costs expected to complete the contract costs included in the measure of progress include direct labor and thirdparty costs such as payments to investigators and other pass through expenses for the company’s clinical monitors this costbased method of revenue recognition requires the company to make estimates of costs to complete its projects on an ongoing basis significant judgment is required to evaluate assumptions related to these estimates the effect of revisions to estimates related to the transaction price or costs to complete a project are recorded in the period in which the estimate is revised most contracts may be terminated upon 30 to 90 days notice by the customer however in the event of termination most contracts require payment for services rendered through the date of termination as well as for subsequent services rendered to close out the contract 

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes includes federal state local and foreign taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled we record us deferred taxes based on the federal corporate income tax rate of 21 we account for tax related to gilti as a period cost when incurred recognition of deferred income tax assets is based on management’s belief that it is more likely than not that the income tax benefit associated with certain temporary differences income tax operating loss capital loss carryforwards and income tax credits would be realized we recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets for those deferred income tax items for which it was more likely than not that realization would not occur we determined the amount of the valuation allowance based in part on our assessment of future taxable income and in light of our ongoing income tax strategies if our estimate of future taxable income or tax strategies changes at any time in the future we would record an adjustment to our valuation allowance recording such an adjustment could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

income tax expense is based on the distribution of profit before income tax among the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate adjusted as required by the income tax laws of each taxing jurisdiction changes in the distribution of profits and losses among taxing jurisdictions may have a significant impact on our effective income tax rate we do not consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states 

business combinations and goodwill 

we use the acquisition method to account for business combinations and accordingly the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recorded at their estimated fair values on the date of the acquisition we use significant judgments estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest including expected future cash flows and discount rates that reflect the risk associated with the expected future cash flows and estimated useful lives 

we have recorded and allocated to our reporting units the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired known as goodwill the recoverability of goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment or if and when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment we perform our annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of july 31 the impairment analysis requires significant judgments estimates and assumptions including those related to macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors financial performance fair value history and other company specific events for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 the company determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 

we review the carrying values of other identifiable intangible assets if the facts and circumstances indicate a possible impairment any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

stockbased compensation 

we measure compensation cost for stockbased payment awards stock options and stock appreciation rights granted to employees and nonemployee directors at fair value using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model stockbased compensation expense includes stockbased awards granted to employees and nonemployee directors and has been reported in selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income based upon the classification of the individuals who were granted stockbased awards 

the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions including share price volatility the expected life of the award riskfree interest rate and the fair value of the underlying common shares on the date of grant in developing our assumptions we take into account the following 

• we calculate expected volatility based on reported data for selected reasonably similar publicly traded companies for which the historical information is available we plan to continue to use the guideline peer group volatility information until the historical volatility of our common shares is relevant to measure expected volatility for future award grants 

• we determine the riskfree interest rate by reference to implied yields available from united states treasury securities with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant 

• we estimate the dividend yield to be zero as we do not currently anticipate paying any future dividends 

• we estimate the average expected life of the award based on our historical experience and 

• we estimate forfeitures based on our historical analysis of actual forfeitures 

the company accounts for its stockbased compensation for performance awards based on the closing market price of the companys common stock on the date of grant and for performance awards that include market conditions based upon the monte carlo simulation model the company records the expense amount of these awards based on its estimates of the likelihood that the various performance targets will be achieved the estimates are assessed on a quarterly basis 

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

we provide retirement benefits to certain employees including defined benefit pension plans and postretirement medical plans the determination of benefit obligations and expense is based on actuarial models in order to measure benefit costs and obligations using these models critical assumptions are made with regard to the discount rate expected return on plan assets cash balance crediting rate lump sum conversion rate and the assumed rate of compensation increases in addition retiree medical care cost trend rates are a key assumption used exclusively in determining costs for our postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans 

recently issued accounting standards 

information relating to recently issued accounting standards is included in note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to various market risks and we regularly evaluate our exposure to such changes our overall risk management strategy seeks to balance the magnitude of the exposure and the cost and availability of appropriate financial instruments the following analyses present the sensitivity of our financial instruments to hypothetical changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period 

foreign currency exchange rates 

we transact business in more than 100 countries and approximately 60 currencies and are subject to risks associated with fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates our objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency exchange rate movements accordingly we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency cash flows related to service contracts it is our policy to enter into foreign currency transactions only to the extent necessary to meet our objectives as stated above we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for investment or speculative purposes the principal currency hedged in 2021 was the british pound 

the contractual value of our foreign exchange derivative instruments all of which were foreign exchange forward contracts was approximately 110 million as of december 31 2021 the fair value of these contracts is subject to change as a result of potential changes in foreign exchange rates we assess our market risk based on changes in foreign exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential gain or loss in fair values based on a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates the potential gain in fair value for foreign exchange forward contracts based on a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the united states dollar was 11 million as of december 31 2021 however the change in the fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts would likely be offset by a change in the value of the future service contract revenue being hedged caused by the currency exchange rate fluctuation the estimated fair values of the foreign exchange forward contracts were determined based on quoted market prices 

exchange rate fluctuations affect the united states dollar value of foreign currency revenue and expenses and may have a significant effect on our results excluding the impacts from any outstanding or future hedging transactions a hypothetical 10 change in average exchange rates used to translate all foreign currencies to the united states dollar would have impacted income before income taxes for 2021 by approximately 94 million the actual impact of exchange rate movements in the future could differ materially from this hypothetical analysis based on the mix of foreign currencies and the timing and magnitude of individual exchange rate movements 

additionally commencing in 2016 we designated a portion of our foreign currency denominated debt as a hedge of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries to reduce the volatility in stockholders’ equity caused by changes in the euro exchange rate with respect to the united states dollar as of december 31 2021 these borrowings net of original issue discount were €5227 million 5929 million a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the united states dollar would lead to a potential loss in fair value of  593 million however this change in fair value would be offset by the change in value of the hedged portion of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries caused by the currency exchange rate fluctuation 

interest rates 

because we have variable rate debt fluctuations in interest rates affect our business we attempt to minimize interest rate risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps we have entered into interest rate swaps with financial institutions that have reset dates and critical terms that match the underlying debt accordingly any change in market value associated with the interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 63 billion of variable rate indebtedness and interest rate swaps with a notional value of 18 billion because we do not attempt to hedge all of our variable rate debt we may incur higher interest costs for the portion of our variable rate debt that is not hedged excluding debt covered by hedges each quarterpoint increase or decrease in the interest rate on our variable rate debt would result in our interest expense changing by approximately 58 million per year 

marketable securities 

as of december 31 2021 we held investments in marketable equity securities these investments are classified as either trading securities or availableforsale securities and are recorded at fair value these securities are subject to price risk as of december 31 2021 the fair value of these investments was 145 million based on the quoted market value of the securities the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease of 10 in quoted market values was approximately 15 million as of december 31 2021

our market opportunity 

we compete in a market of greater than 260 billion consisting of outsourced research and development realworld evidence and connected health and technology enabled clinical and commercial operations markets for life sciences companies and the broader healthcare industry the following sets forth our estimates for the size of our principal markets 

• outsourced research and development biopharmaceutical spending on drug development totaled approximately 130 billion in 2020 of that amount we estimate that our addressable opportunity clinical development spending excluding preclinical spending was approximately 75 billion the portion of this addressable opportunity that was outsourced in 2020 based on our estimates was approximately 36 billion 

• realworld evidence and connected health total addressable market of approximately 80 billion based on 2020 sales that consists of two relatively equal parts first the market for realworld evidence of approximately 40 billion includes traditionally defined analytic platforms and implementation medical and scientific analytic services observation studies and market access second the market for connected healthcare of approximately 40 billion includes areas such as revenue cycle management payer analytics and clinical decision support services and 

• technology enabled commercial operations total addressable market of approximately 50 billion based on 2020 sales that includes information data warehousing it outsourcing software applications and other services in the broader market for it services this addressable market also includes commercial services such as recruiting training deploying and managing global sales forces channel management patient engagement services market access consulting brand communication advisory services and health information analytics and technology consulting 

in deriving estimates of the size of the various markets described above we review thirdparty sources which include estimates and forecasts of spending in various segments in combination with internal iqvia research and analysis informed by our experience serving these segments as well as projected growth rates for each of these segments see “industry and market data” above 

we believe there are six key trends affecting our end markets that will create increasing demand for research and development services technology  analytics solutions and contract sales and medical solutions 

growth and innovation in the life sciences industry the life sciences industry is a large and critical part of the global healthcare system and according to the latest information available from the iqvia market prognosis service is estimated to have generated approximately 127 trillion in revenue in 2020 according to our research revenue growth in the life sciences industry globally is expected to range from 3 to 6 between 2021 and 2025 according to the iqvia institute it is estimated that spending on pharmaceuticals in emerging markets will expand at a 6 to 9 compound annual growth rate “cagr” through 2025 the growth of emerging markets is making these geographies strategically important to life sciences organizations and consistent with their approach in the developed markets we expect these organizations to apply a high degree of sophistication to their commercial operations in these countries for global companies this requires highly localized knowledge and information assets the development of market access strategies and performance benchmarking in addition local players are learning that they need to compete on the basis of improved information and analytics 

growth in research and development spending trends in research and development are impacted as a result of several factors including major biopharmaceutical companies’ efforts to replenish revenues lost from the socalled “patent cliff” increased access to capital by the small and midcap biotechnology industry and recent increases in pharmaceutical approvals by regulatory authorities the iqvia institute also estimates that approximately 270 new molecular entities “nmes” are expected to be approved between 2021 and 2025 compared to 234 between 2016 and 2020 and 220 between 2011 and 2015 we believe that further research 

and development spending combined with the continued need for cost efficiency across the healthcare landscape will continue to create opportunities for biopharmaceutical services companies particularly those with a global reach and broad service offerings to help biopharmaceutical companies with their pre and postlaunch solutions development and commercialization needs 

increased complexity in research and development biopharmaceutical companies face environments in which it has become increasingly difficult to operate improved standards of care in many therapeutic areas and the emergence of new types of therapies such as biologics genetically targeted therapies gene and stem cell therapies and other treatment modalities have led to more complex development and regulatory pathways we believe that our global clinical development capabilities including our expertise in biomarkers and genomics and our global laboratory network position us well to help biopharmaceutical companies manage the complexities inherent in an environment where this type of expertise is important for example connected intelligence helps us validate protocols to ensure studies in new disease areas have greater accuracy and also enables us through innovations such as predictive analytics to find patients who may not have been diagnosed 

regulators require clinical trials involving local populations as part of the process for approving new pharmaceutical products especially in certain asian and emerging markets understanding the epidemiological and physiological differences in different ethnic populations and being able to conduct clinical trials locally in certain geographies will be important to pharmaceutical product growth strategies both for multinational and localregional biopharmaceutical companies we believe that our global clinical development capabilities and unmatched presence in asia and other emerging markets make us a strong partner for biopharmaceutical companies managing the complexities of international drug development 

financial pressures driving the need for increased efficiency despite expected accelerating growth in the global life sciences market we believe our clients will face increased operating margin pressure due to their changing product mix pricing and reimbursement challenges and rising costs of compliance product portfolios for life sciences companies have shifted toward specialty products with lower peak market sales potential than traditional primary care medicines we believe that the need for biopharmaceutical companies to maximize productivity and lower costs across their processes from research and development through commercial operations will cause them to look to partners as they enter into outsourcing arrangements to improve efficiency further our clients are looking for new ways to simplify processes and drive operational efficiencies by using automation consolidating vendors and adopting new technology options such as hosted and cloudbased applications this provides opportunities for technology services vendors to capture and consolidate internal spending by providing lowercost and variablecost options that lower clients’ research and development selling marketing and administrative costs 

evolving need to integrate and structure expanding sources of data over the past decade many health systems around the world have focused on digitizing medical records while such records theoretically enhance access to data relevant information is often unintegrated unstructured siloed in disparate software systems or entered inconsistently in addition new sources of data from the internet such as social media and information on limited patient pools and information resulting from enhanced diagnostic technologies are creating new sources of healthcare data 

in order to derive valuable insights from existing and expanding sources of information clients need access to statistically significant data sets organized into databases that can be queried and analyzed for example realworld evidence studies demonstrate practical and clinical efficacies which we believe require the aggregation and integration of large clinical data sets across all care settings types of therapies and patient cohorts longitudinal studies require analysis of nonidentified patient diagnoses treatments procedures and laboratory test results to identify types of patients that will likely best respond to particular therapies finally manufacturers also require the ability to analyze social media activity to identify unmet patient needs and support for new orphan drugs this information is highly relevant to all healthcare stakeholders and we believe the opportunity to more broadly apply healthcare data can only be realized through structuring organizing and integrating new and existing forms of data in conjunction with sophisticated analytics 

need for demonstrated value in healthcare participants in the healthcare industry are focused on improving quality and reducing costs both of which require assessment of quality and value of therapies and providers as a result physicians no longer make prescribing decisions in isolation but rather in the context of guidance and rules from payers integrated delivery networks and governments we believe life sciences companies are working to bring alignment across constituents on the value of their treatments in order to successfully develop and commercialize new therapies 

there is increasing pressure on life sciences companies to support and justify the value of their therapies many new drugs that are being approved are more expensive than existing therapies and will likely receive heightened scrutiny by regulators and payers to determine whether the existing treatment options would be sufficient additionally many new specialty drugs are molecularbased therapies and require a more detailed understanding of clinical factors and influencers that demonstrate therapeutic value as a result leading life sciences companies are utilizing more sophisticated outcome research and data analytics services 

we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of these global trends in healthcare beyond our proprietary information assets we have developed key capabilities to assess opportunities to develop and commercialize therapies support and defend the value of medicines and help our clients operate more efficiently through the application of insightdriven decisionmaking and costefficient technology solutions

protection and support of our employees during the covid19 pandemic  as a company we did our best to support our employees preserve employment and maintain base compensation throughout the year we accepted that our financial performance would be affected by the pandemic but declined to make dramatic cuts that would impact the lives of our employees we also launched the iqvia cares program to provide over 1 million of financial assistance to approximately 2200 employees facing financial hardship resulting from the crisis this program was entirely funded by our directors senior leaders and other employees from around the world voluntarily forgoing a portion of their pay for a period of time we continued to build a strong supportive culture around values of mutual respect and pride in the important work we do this will endure far beyond the crisis 

the safety of employees patients healthcare professionals customers and suppliers with whom we frequently interact was our highest priority as covid19 spread across the globe to limit exposure we substantially restricted travel supplied personal protective equipment to fieldbased employees closed facilities and asked most of our staff to work remotely on short notice we added bandwidth and vpn capacity to our advanced infrastructure to enable 95 of our employees at the peak of the pandemic to work remotely and avoid service disruptions at the same time we continued to maintain and enhance our cybersecurity protections which included completing the global rollout of our core endpoint detection  response solution to all workstations thus protecting them from cyber threats regardless of location and network status on or off vpn and accelerating the deployment of an advance response tool to enable bulk remediation of vulnerabilities on remote workstations

for a more complete discussion of the material risk facing our business see below 

risks relating to our business 

our business and operations has been and may in the future be adversely affected by the novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic 

the outbreak of the novel coronavirus or covid19 and the various governmental industry and consumer actions related thereto could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these effects which largely depend on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted and are uncertain could include a negative impact on the availability of our key personnel temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our business partners customers suppliers third party service providers or other vendors an increased risk of customer defaults or delays in payments or purchasing decisions and the interruption of domestic and global supply chains distribution channels liquidity and capital or financial markets 

as covid19 continues to spread we have and may in the future experience disruptions that could severely impact our business including 

• closure or inaccessibility of clinical site locations 

• delays or difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials and starting new clinical trials 

• delays or difficulties in clinical site initiation including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff 

• interruption of key clinical trial activities such as clinical trial site monitoring due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments employers and others 

• delays in receiving approval from local regulatory authorities to initiate our planned clinical trials and 

• significant disruption in our businesses that rely on facetoface interactions or are dependent on inperson gatherings events or conferences 

in addition we have directed a substantial portion of our workforce to work from home while the outbreak persists in order to help minimize the risk of covid19 to our employees having a significant portion of our workforce working from home could cause an increased risk of loss of productivity greater cybersecurity risk and increased risk to our system of internal controls over financial reporting 

further the effects of the pandemic may also increase our cost of capital or make additional capital more difficult or available only on terms less favorable to us 

the potential loss or delay of our large contracts or of multiple contracts could adversely affect our results 

most of our research  development solutions clients can terminate our contracts upon 30 to 90 days notice our clients may delay terminate or reduce the scope of our contracts for a variety of reasons beyond our control including but not limited to 

• decisions to forego or terminate a particular clinical trial 

• lack of available financing budgetary limits or changing priorities 

• actions by regulatory authorities 

• production problems resulting in shortages of the drug being tested 

• failure of products being tested to satisfy safety requirements or efficacy criteria 

• unexpected or undesired clinical results for products 

• insufficient patient enrollment in a clinical trial 

• insufficient investigator recruitment 

• shift of business to a competitor or internal resources 

• product withdrawal following market launch or 

• shut down of manufacturing facilities 

the covid19 pandemic or a similar global event could also exacerbate many of the above situations and cause delays changes in scope or cancellation of our contracts as a result contract terminations delays and alterations are a regular part of our research  development solutions business in the event of termination our contracts often provide for fees for winding down the project but these fees may not be sufficient for us to realize the full amount of revenues or profits anticipated under the related services contracts and termination may result in lower resource utilization rates in addition we will not realize the full benefits of our backlog of contractually committed services if our clients cancel delay or reduce their commitments under our contracts with them which may occur if among other things a client decides to shift its business to a competitor or revoke our status as a preferred provider thus the loss or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could adversely affect our revenues and profitability we believe the risk of loss or delay of multiple contracts potentially has greater effect where we are party to broader partnering arrangements with global biopharmaceutical companies 

we depend on third parties for data and support services our suppliers or providers might restrict our use of or refuse to license data or provide services which could lead to our inability to access certain data or provide certain services and as a result materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

each of our technology  analytics solutions information services is derived from data we collect from third parties these data suppliers are numerous and diverse reflecting the broad scope of information that we collect and use in our business 

although we typically enter into longterm contractual arrangements with many of these suppliers of data at the time of entry into a new contract or renewal of an existing contract suppliers may increase restrictions on our use of such data increase the price they charge us for data or refuse altogether to license the data to us in addition during the term of any data supply contract suppliers may fail to adhere to our data quality control standards or fail to deliver data further although no single individual data supplier is material to our business if a number of suppliers collectively representing a significant amount of data that we use for one or more of our services were to impose additional contractual restrictions on our use of or access to data fail to adhere to our qualitycontrol standards repeatedly fail to deliver data or refuse to provide data now or in the future our ability to provide those services to our clients could be materially adversely impacted which may harm our operating results and financial condition 

additionally we depend on third parties for support services to our business such support services include but are not limited to third party transportation providers suppliers of drugs for patients participating in clinical trials suppliers of kits for use in our clinical trial laboratories business suppliers of reagents for use in our testing equipment and providers of maintenance contracts for our equipment the failure of any of these third parties to adequately provide the critical support services could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if we fail to perform our services in accordance with contractual requirements regulatory standards and ethical considerations we could be subject to significant costs or liability and our reputation could be harmed 

we contract with biopharmaceutical companies to perform a wide range of services to assist them in bringing new drugs to market our services include monitoring clinical trials data and laboratory analysis electronic data capture patient recruitment and other related services and we perform these services in a number of ways including through physical and technologyenabled efforts such services are complex and subject to contractual requirements regulatory standards and ethical considerations for example we must adhere to regulatory requirements such as the fda and current gcp and good laboratory practice requirements if we fail to perform our services in accordance with these requirements regulatory agencies may take action against us for failure to comply with applicable regulations governing clinical trials or sales and marketing practices such actions may include sanctions such as injunctions or failure of such regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of products delay suspension or withdrawal of approvals license revocation product seizures or recalls operational restrictions civil or criminal penalties or prosecutions damages or fines clients may also bring claims against us for breach of our contractual obligations and patients in the clinical trials and patients taking drugs approved on the basis of those clinical trials may bring personal injury claims against us for negligence any such action could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and reputation 

such consequences could arise if among other things the following occur 

improper performance of our services the performance of clinical development services is complex and timeconsuming for example we may make mistakes in conducting a clinical trial that could negatively impact or obviate the usefulness of the clinical trial or cause the results of the clinical trial to be reported improperly if the clinical trial results are compromised we could be subject to significant costs or liability which could have an adverse impact on our ability to perform our services as examples 

• noncompliance generally could result in the termination of ongoing clinical trials or sales and marketing projects or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities 

• compromise of data from a particular clinical trial such as failure to verify that informed consent was obtained from patients could require us to repeat the clinical trial under the terms of our contract at no further cost to our client but at a substantial cost to us and 

• breach of a contractual term could result in liability for damages or termination of the contract 

large clinical trials can cost up to hundreds of millions of dollars and while we endeavor to contractually limit our exposure to such risks improper performance of our services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition damage our reputation and result in the cancellation of current contracts by or failure to obtain future contracts from the affected client or other clients 

investigation of clients from time to time one or more of our clients are audited or investigated by regulatory authorities or enforcement agencies with respect to regulatory compliance of their clinical trials programs or the marketing and sale of their drugs in these situations we have often provided services to our clients with respect to the clinical trials programs or activities being audited or investigated and we are called upon to respond to requests for information by the authorities and agencies there is a risk that either our clients or regulatory authorities could claim that we performed our services improperly or that we are responsible for clinical trial or program compliance if our clients or regulatory authorities make such claims against us and prove them we could be subject to damages fines or penalties in addition negative publicity regarding regulatory compliance of our clients’ clinical trials programs or drugs could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

insufficient client funding to complete a clinical trial as noted above clinical trials can cost hundreds of millions of dollars there is a risk that we may initiate a clinical trial for a client and then the client becomes unwilling or unable to fund the completion of the clinical trial in such a situation notwithstanding the client’s ability or willingness to pay for or otherwise facilitate the completion of the clinical trial we may be ethically bound to complete or wind down the clinical trial at our own expense 

security breaches and unauthorized use of our it systems and information or the it systems or information in the possession of our vendors could expose us our clients our data suppliers or others to risk of loss 

we rely upon the security of our computer and communications systems infrastructure to protect us from cyberattacks and unauthorized access cyberattacks can include malware computer viruses hacking or other significant disruption of our computer communications and related systems cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems as cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against one or more cyber threats might defeat the measures that we or our vendors take to anticipate detect avoid or mitigate such threats certain techniques used to obtain unauthorized access introduce malicious software disable or degrade service or sabotage systems may be designed to remain dormant until a triggering event and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures since techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources although we take steps to manage and avoid these risks and to prevent their recurrence our preventive and remedial actions may not be successful such attacks whether successful or unsuccessful could result in our incurring costs related to for example rebuilding internal systems defending against litigation responding to regulatory inquiries or actions paying damages or fines or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties publicity about vulnerabilities and attempted or successful incursions could damage our reputation with clients and data suppliers and reduce demand for our services 

we also store proprietary and sensitive information in connection with our business which could be compromised by a cyberattack to the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data an inappropriate disclosure of proprietary or sensitive information an inability to access data sources or an inability to process data or provide our offerings to our clients it could cause significant damage to our reputation affect our relationships with our data suppliers and clients including loss of suppliers and clients lead to claims against us and ultimately harm our business we may be required to incur significant costs to alleviate remedy or protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future we may also face inquiry or 

increased scrutiny from government agencies as a result of any such disruption or breach while we have insurance coverage for certain instances of a cyber security breach our coverage may not be sufficient if we suffer a significant attack or multiple attacks any such breach or disruption could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and our reputation as a service provider 

some of our vendors have significant responsibility for the security of certain of our data centers and computerbased platforms or softwareasaservice saas applications upon which our businesses rely to host or process data or to perform various functions also our data suppliers have responsibility for security of their own computer and communications environments these third parties face risks relating to cyber security similar to ours which could disrupt their businesses and therefore materially impact ours accordingly we are subject to any flaw in or breaches to their computer and communications systems or those that they operate for us which could result in a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial results 

failure to meet productivity objectives under our internal business transformation initiatives could adversely impact our competitiveness and harm our operating results 

we are pursuing business transformation initiatives to update technology increase innovation and obtain operating efficiencies as part of these initiatives which include accelerating site startup timelines and improving our customer buying experience we seek to improve our productivity flexibility quality functionality and cost savings by investing in the development and implementation of global platforms and integration of our business processes and functions to achieve economies of scale these various initiatives may not yield their intended gains or be completed in timely manner which may impact our competitiveness and our ability to meet our growth objectives and as a result materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

if we are unsuccessful at investing in growth opportunities our business could be materially and adversely affected 

we continue to invest significantly in growth opportunities including the development and acquisition of new data technologies and services to meet our clients’ needs for example we are expanding our services and technology offerings such as the development of a cloudbased platform with a growing number of applications to support commercial and clinical operations for life sciences companies eg multichannel marketing marketing campaign management customer relationship management incentive compensation management targeting and segmentation performance management site engagement payments trial master file risk based monitoring clinical trial management and decentralized trials and other applications we also continue to invest significantly in growth opportunities in emerging markets such as the development launch and enhancement of services in china india russia turkey and other countries we consider our presence in these markets to be an important component of our growth strategy 

there is no assurance that our investment plans or growth strategy will be successful or will produce a sufficient or any return on our investments further if we are unable to develop new technologies and services clients do not purchase our new technologies and services our new technologies and services do not work as intended or there are delays in the availability or adoption of our new technologies and services then we may not be able to grow our business or growth may occur slower than anticipated additionally although we expect continued growth in healthcare spending in emerging markets such spending may occur more slowly or not at all and we may not benefit from our investments in these markets 

we plan to fund growth opportunities with cash from operations or from future financings there can be no assurance that those sources will be available in sufficient amounts to fund future growth opportunities when needed 

any of the foregoing could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

data protection privacy and similar laws in the united states and around the world restrict access use and disclosure of personal information and failure to comply with or adapt to changes in these laws could materially and adversely harm our business 

the confidentiality collection use retention security transfer and disclosure of personal data including individually identifiable health information and clinical trial patientspecific information are subject to governmental regulation generally in the country that the personal data were collected or used collectively privacy laws for example united states federal regulations under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” create specific requirements for the protection of the privacy and security of individual health information these provisions apply to both “covered entities” primarily health care 

providers and health insurers and their “business associates” or service providers as there are some instances where we are a hipaa “business associate” of a “covered entity” we can be directly liable for mishandling protected health information under hipaa’s enforcement scheme we can be subject to significant penalties in connection with hipaa violations along with the potential for significant other expenditures related to these activities these rules require individuals’ written authorization in many situations in addition to any required informed consent before protected health information may be used for research we are both directly and indirectly affected by the privacy provisions surrounding individual authorizations because many investigators with whom we are involved in clinical trials are directly subject to them as a hipaa “covered entity” and because we obtain identifiable health information from third parties that are subject to such regulations 

in general patient health information is among the most sensitive and highly regulated of personal information privacy laws in the united states and around the world are designed to ensure that information about an individual’s healthcare is properly protected from inappropriate access use and disclosure privacy laws also include the european union’s “eu” general data protection regulation canada’s personal information protection and electronic documents act and other data protection privacy data security data localization and similar national stateprovincial and local laws in the eu personal data includes any information that relates to an identifiable natural person health information about an identifiable person carries additional obligations under eu law including obtaining the explicit consent from the individual for collection use or disclosure of the information in addition we are subject to eu rules with respect to crossborder transfers of such data out of the eu along with similar data transfer requirements or data localization requirements in other countries 

we have established frameworks models processes and technologies to manage privacy and security for many data types from a variety of sources and under a myriad of privacy laws in addition we rely on our data suppliers to deliver information to us in a form and in a manner that complies with applicable privacy laws these laws are complex and there is no assurance that the safeguards and controls employed by us or our data suppliers will be sufficient to prevent a breach of these laws or that claims will not be filed against us or our data suppliers despite such safeguards and controls failure to comply with such laws certain certificationregistration and annual recertificationregistration provisions associated with these data protection and privacy regulations and similar rules in various jurisdictions or to resolve any serious privacy complaints may result in among other things regulatory sanctions criminal prosecution civil liability negative publicity damage to our reputation or data being blocked from use or liability under contractual provisions for example in july 2015 indictments were issued by the seoul central district prosecutors’ office in south korea against ims korea and two of its employees among others alleging improper handling of sensitive health information in violation of applicable privacy laws see item 3 “legal proceedings” for additional information 

laws and expectations relating to privacy continue to evolve and we continue to adapt to changing needs for example the definition of “personally identifiable information” and “personal data” continues to evolve and broaden and many new laws and regulations are being enacted in addition certain established programs have been or are at risk of being declared invalid such as the euus privacy shield framework that operated for several years but was struck down by the european court of justice in july 2020 so that this area remains in a state of flux changes to these programs may adversely impact our ability to provide services to our clients or develop new products or services federal state and foreign governments are contemplating or have proposed or adopted new privacy laws or modifications to existing privacy laws including by amendment replacement or interpretation through judicial or administrative decisions new or modified privacy laws might among other things require us to implement new security measures and processes or bring within the scope of the privacy law other data not currently regulated each of which may require substantial expenditures or limit our ability to offer some of our services additionally changes in privacy laws may limit our data access use and disclosure and may require increased expenditures by us or may dictate that we not offer certain types of services any of the foregoing may have a material adverse impact on our ability to provide services to our clients or maintain our profitability 

there is ongoing concern from privacy advocates regulators and others regarding data protection and privacy issues and the number of jurisdictions with privacy laws has been increasing also there are ongoing public policy discussions regarding whether the standards for deidentified anonymous or pseudonymized health information are sufficient and the risk of reidentification sufficiently small to adequately protect patient privacy these discussions may lead to further restrictions on the use of such information there can be no assurance that these initiatives or future initiatives will not adversely affect our ability to access and use data or to develop or market current or future services 

many privacy laws protect more than patient information and although they vary by jurisdiction these laws can extend to employee information business contact information provider information and other information relating to identifiable individuals failure to comply with these laws may result in among other things civil and criminal liability negative publicity damage to our 

reputation and liability under contractual provisions in addition compliance with such laws may require increased costs to us or may dictate that we not offer certain types of services 

the occurrence of any of the foregoing could impact our ability to provide the same level of service to our clients require us to modify our offerings or increase our costs which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 

our success depends in part upon our ability to develop use and protect our proprietary methodologies analytics systems technologies and other intellectual property we rely upon a combination of trade secrets confidentiality policies nondisclosure invention assignment and other contractual arrangements and patent copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights these laws are subject to change at any time and certain agreements may not be fully enforceable which could further restrict our ability to protect our innovations further these laws may not provide adequate protection for our intellectual property particularly in countries in which the legal system provides less protection for intellectual property rights our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing services similar to or duplicative of ours further the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors former employees or other third parties and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 

our ability to obtain protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation or thirdparty opposition risks as well as the uncertainty as to the scope of protection registrability patentability validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights in each applicable country governments may adopt regulations and government agencies or courts may render decisions requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property rights when we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights we may be subject to claims that the intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our confidential and proprietary information litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly time consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property rights furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management’s attention and resources could delay further sales or the implementation of our solutions impair the functionality of our solutions delay introductions of new solutions result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our solutions or injure our reputation and harm our operating results and financial condition 

the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could reduce the differentiation of our services and harm our business the value of our investment in development or business acquisitions could be reduced and third parties might make claims against us related to losses of their confidential or proprietary information in addition we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights these incidents and claims could harm our business reduce revenue increase expenses and harm our reputation 

we may be subject to claims by others that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights 

third parties may assert claims that we or our clients infringe their intellectual property rights and these claims with or without merit could be expensive to litigate cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management resources and attention in defending the claim in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can also seek injunctive relief that may limit the operation of our business or prevent the marketing and selling of our services that infringe on the plaintiff’s intellectual property rights to resolve these claims we may enter into licensing agreements with restrictive terms or significant fees stop selling be required to implement costly redesigns to the affected services or pay damages to satisfy contractual obligations to others if we do not resolve these claims in advance of a trial there is no guarantee that we will be successful in court these outcomes may have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition certain contracts with our suppliers or clients contain provisions whereby we indemnify subject to certain limitations the counterparty for damages suffered as a result of claims related to intellectual property infringement and the use of data claims made under these provisions could be expensive to litigate and could result in significant payments 

we rely on licenses from third parties to certain technology and intellectual property rights for some of our services and the licenses we currently have could terminate or expire 

some of our business services rely on technology or intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others our licenses to this technology or these intellectual property rights could be terminated or could expire we may be unable to replace these licenses in a timely manner failure to renew these licenses or renewals of these licenses on less advantageous terms could harm our operating results and financial condition 

our financial results may be adversely affected if we underprice our contracts overrun our cost estimates or fail to receive approval for or experience delays in documenting change orders 

most of our research  development solutions contracts are either fee for service contracts or fixedfee contracts our past financial results have been and our future financial results may be adversely impacted if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates and are unable to successfully negotiate a change order change orders typically occur when the scope of work we perform needs to be modified from that originally contemplated by our contract with the client modifications can occur for example when there is a change in a key clinical trial assumption or parameter or a significant change in timing where we are not successful in converting outofscope work into change orders under our current contracts we bear the cost of the additional work such underpricing significant cost overruns or delay in documentation of change orders could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

the relationship of backlog to revenues varies over time 

backlog represents future revenues for our research  development solutions business from work not yet completed or performed under signed binding commitments and signed contracts once work begins on a project revenue is recognized over the duration of the project projects may be terminated or delayed by the client or delayed by regulatory authorities for reasons beyond our control to the extent projects are delayed the timing of our revenue could be affected in the event that a client cancels a contract we typically would be entitled to receive payment for all services performed up to the cancellation date and subsequent clientauthorized services related to terminating the canceled project typically however we have no contractual right to the full amount of the revenue reflected in our backlog in the event of a contract cancellation the duration of the projects included in our backlog and the related revenue recognition range from a few weeks to many years our backlog may not be indicative of our future revenues from our research  development solutions business and we may not realize all the anticipated future revenue reflected in our backlog a number of factors may affect backlog including 

• the size complexity and duration of the projects 

• the percentage of full services versus functional services 

• the cancellation or delay of projects and 

• change in the scope of work during the course of a project 

although an increase in backlog will generally result in an increase in revenues to be recognized over time depending on the level of cancellations an increase in backlog at a particular point in time does not necessarily correspond directly to an increase in revenues during a particular period the extent to which contracts in backlog will result in revenue depends on many factors including but not limited to delivery against projected schedules the need for scope changes change orders contract cancellations and the nature duration size complexity and phase of the contracts each of which factors can vary significantly from time to time 

the rate at which our backlog converts to revenue may vary over time for a variety of reasons the revenue recognition on larger more global projects could be slower than on smaller less global projects for a variety of reasons including but not limited to an extended period of negotiation between the time the project is awarded to us and the actual execution of the contract as well as an 

increased timeframe for obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals additionally the increased complexity of the drug development pipeline and the need to enroll precise patient populations could extend the length of clinical trials causing revenue to be recognized over a longer period of time further delayed projects will remain in backlog unless otherwise canceled by the client and will not generate revenue at the rate originally expected thus the relationship of backlog to realized revenues may vary over time 

our business depends on the continued effectiveness and availability of our information systems including the information systems we use to provide our services to our clients and failures of these systems may materially limit our operations 

due to the global nature of our business and our reliance on information systems to provide our services we intend to increase our use of webenabled and other integrated information systems in delivering our services we also provide access to similar information systems to certain of our clients in connection with the services we provide them as the breadth and complexity of our information systems continue to grow we will increasingly be exposed to the risks inherent in the development integration and ongoing operation of evolving information systems including 

• disruption impairment or failure of data centers telecommunications facilities or other key infrastructure platforms 

• security breaches of cyberattacks on and other failures or malfunctions in our critical application systems or their associated hardware and 

• excessive costs excessive delays or other deficiencies in systems development and deployment 

the materialization of any of these risks may impede the processing of data the delivery of databases and services and the daytoday management of our business and could result in the corruption loss or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary confidential or other data while we have disaster recovery plans in place they might not adequately protect us in the event of a system failure while many of our operations have disaster recovery plans in place we currently do not have excess or standby computer processing or network capacity everywhere in the world to avoid disruption in the receipt processing and delivery of data in the event of a system failure despite any precautions we take damage from fire floods hurricanes power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses breakins and similar events at our various computer facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to our servers and from our servers to our clients corruption or loss of data may result in the need to repeat a clinical trial at no cost to the client but at significant cost to us the termination of a contract or damage to our reputation 

in addition any failure by our computer environment to provide sufficient processing or network capacity to transfer data could result in interruptions in our service in the event of a delay in the delivery of data we could be required to transfer our data collection operations to an alternative provider of server hosting services such a transfer could result in significant delays in our ability to deliver services to our clients and increase our costs additionally significant delays in system enhancements or inadequate performance of new or upgraded systems once completed could damage our reputation and harm our business finally longterm disruptions in the infrastructure caused by events such as natural disasters the outbreak of war the escalation of hostilities and acts of terrorism particularly involving cities in which we have offices could adversely affect our businesses although we carry property and business interruption insurance our coverage might not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur 

we have continued to undertake significant programs to optimize business processes with respect to our services our inability to effectively manage the implementation and adapt to new processes designed into new or upgraded systems in a timely and costeffective manner may result in disruption to our business and negatively affect our operations 

we have entered into agreements with certain vendors to provide systems development and integration services that develop or license to us the it platform for programs to optimize our business processes if such vendors fail to perform as required or if there are substantial delays in developing implementing and updating the it platform our client delivery may be impaired and we may have to make substantial further investments internally or with third parties to achieve our objectives additionally our progress may be limited by parties with existing or claimed patents who seek to enjoin us from using preferred technology or seek license payments from us meeting our objectives is dependent on a number of factors which may not take place as we anticipate including obtaining adequate technologyenabled services creating itenabled services that our clients will find desirable and implementing our business model with respect to these services also increased itrelated expenditures may negatively impact our profitability 

we may experience challenges with the acquisition development enhancement or deployment of technology necessary for our business 

we operate in businesses that require sophisticated computer systems and software for data collection data processing cloudbased platforms analytics cryptography statistical projections and forecasting mobile computing social media analytics and other applications and technologies particularly in our technology  analytics solutions and research  development solutions businesses we seek to address our technology risks by increasing our reliance on the use of innovations by crossindustry technology leaders and adapt these for our biopharmaceutical and healthcare industry clients some of these technologies supporting the industries we serve are changing rapidly and we must continue to adapt to these changes in a timely and effective manner at an acceptable cost we also must continue to deliver data to our clients in forms that are easy to use while simultaneously providing clear answers to complex questions there can be no guarantee that we will be able to develop acquire or integrate new technologies that these new technologies will meet our needs or those of our clients’ needs or achieve expected investment goals or that we will be able to do so as quickly or costeffectively as our competitors significant technological change could render certain of our services obsolete moreover the introduction of new services embodying new technologies could render certain of our existing services obsolete our continued success will depend on our ability to adapt to changing technologies manage and process everincreasing amounts of data and information and improve the performance features and reliability of our services in response to changing client and industry demands we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful design development testing introduction or marketing of our services new services or enhancements to existing services may not adequately meet our own requirements or those of current and prospective clients or achieve any degree of significant market acceptance these types of failures could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and reputation 

consolidation in the industries in which our clients operate may reduce the volume of services purchased by consolidated clients following an acquisition or merger which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 

mergers or consolidations among our clients have in the past and could in the future reduce the number of our clients and potential clients when companies consolidate overlapping services previously purchased separately are usually purchased only once by the combined entity leading to loss of revenue other services that were previously purchased by one of the merged or consolidated entities may be deemed unnecessary or cancelled if our clients merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services there can be no assurance as to the degree to which we may be able to address the revenue impact of such consolidation any of these developments could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by client or therapeutic concentration 

although we did not have any client that represented 10 or more of our revenues in 2020 2019 and 2018 we derive the majority of our revenues from a number of large clients if any large client decreases or terminates its relationship with us our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

additionally conducting multiple clinical trials for different clients in a single therapeutic class involving drugs with the same or similar chemical action has in the past and may in the future adversely affect our business if some or all of the clinical trials are canceled because of new scientific information or regulatory judgments that affect the drugs as a class or if industry consolidation results in the rationalization of drug development pipelines similarly marketing and selling drugs for different biopharmaceutical companies with similar chemical actions subjects us to risk if new scientific information or regulatory judgment prejudices the drugs as a class which may lead to compelled or voluntary prescription limitations or withdrawal of some or all of such drugs from the market 

our business is subject to international economic political and other risks that could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we have significant operations in countries that may require complex arrangements to deliver services throughout the world for our clients additionally we have established operations in locations remote from our most developed business centers as a result we are subject to heightened risks inherent in conducting business internationally including the following 

• required compliance with a variety of local laws and regulations which may be materially different than those to which we are subject in the united states or which may change unexpectedly for example conducting a single clinical trial across multiple countries is complex and issues in one country such as a failure to comply with local regulations or restrictions may affect the progress of the clinical trial in the other countries for example by 

limiting the amount of data necessary for a clinical trial to proceed resulting in delays or potential cancellation of contracts which in turn may result in loss of revenue 

• the united states or foreign countries could enact legislation or impose regulations or other restrictions including unfavorable labor regulations tax policies or economic sanctions which could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business in or expatriate profits from the countries in which we operate including hiring retaining and overseeing qualified management personnel for managing operations in multiple countries differing employment practices and labor issues and taxrelated risks including the imposition of taxes and the lack of beneficial treaties that result in a higher effective tax rate for us 

• foreign countries are expanding or may expand their regulatory framework with respect to patient informed consent protection and compensation in clinical trials which could delay or inhibit our ability to conduct clinical trials in such jurisdictions 

• the regulatory or judicial authorities of foreign countries may not enforce legal rights and recognize business procedures in a manner in which we are accustomed or would reasonably expect 

• local economic political and social conditions including potential hyperinflationary conditions political instability and potential nationalization repatriation expropriation price controls or other restrictive government actions including changes in political and economic conditions may lead to changes in the business environment in which we operate as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

• immigration laws are subject to legislative change and varying standards of application and enforcement due to political forces economic conditions or other events including proposals in the us to change limitations on temporary and permanent workers and local immigration laws may require us to meet certain other legal requirements as a condition to obtaining or maintaining entry visas which may impact our ability to provide services to our clients 

• potential violations of local laws or antibribery laws such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and the uk bribery act may cause difficulty in managing foreign operations as well as significant consequences to us if those laws are violated 

• regulatory changes and economic conditions following the uk’s exit from the eu “brexit” including uncertainties as to its effect on trade laws tariffs instability and volatility in the global financial and currency markets conflicting or redundant regulatory regimes in europe and political stability 

• clients in foreign jurisdictions may have longer payment cycles and it may be more difficult to collect receivables in foreign jurisdictions and 

• natural disasters pandemics such as the covid19 coronavirus or international conflict including terrorist acts could interrupt our services endanger our personnel lower patient visits and increase patient dropout rates cause delays in recruitment of new patients decrease the productivity of our clinical research associates cause other project delays or loss of clinical trial materials or results 

these risks and uncertainties could negatively impact our ability to among other things perform large global projects for our clients furthermore our ability to deal with these issues could be affected by applicable united states laws and the need to protect our assets any such risks could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

exchange rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial condition 

because a large portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar and our financial statements are reported in united states dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition exchange rate fluctuations between local currencies and the united states dollar create risk in several ways including 

• foreign currency translation risk the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies and translated into united states dollars for financial reporting purposes accordingly exchange rate fluctuations will affect the translation of foreign results into united states dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated results 

• foreign currency transaction risk we are subject to foreign currency transaction risk for fluctuations in exchange rates during the period of time between the consummation and cash settlement of a transaction we earn revenue from our service contracts over a period of several months and in some cases over several years accordingly exchange rate fluctuations during this period may affect our profitability with respect to such contracts 

we may limit these risks through exchange rate fluctuation provisions stated in our service contracts or we may hedge our transaction risk with foreign currency exchange contracts or options we have not however hedged all of our foreign currency transaction risk and we may experience fluctuations in financial results from our operations outside the united states and foreign currency transaction risk associated with our service contracts 

due to the global nature of our business we may be exposed to liabilities under anticorruption laws including the united states foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and various international anticorruption laws and any allegation or determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are required to comply with the fcpa the uk bribery act and other international anticorruption laws which prohibit companies from engaging in bribery including corruptly or improperly offering promising or providing money or anything else of value to nonunited states officials and certain other recipients in addition the fcpa imposes certain books records and accounting control obligations on public companies and other issuers we operate in parts of the world in which corruption can be common and compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices our global operations face the risk of unauthorized payments or offers being made by employees consultants sales agents and other business partners outside of our control or without our authorization it is our policy to implement safeguards to prohibit these practices by our employees and business partners with respect to our operations however irrespective of these safeguards or as a result of monitoring compliance with such safeguards it is possible that we or certain other parties may discover or receive information at some point that certain employees consultants sales agents or other business partners may have engaged in corrupt conduct for which we might be held responsible violations of the fcpa the uk bribery act or other international anticorruption laws may result in restatements of or irregularities in our financial statements as well as severe criminal or civil sanctions and we may be subject to other liabilities which could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition in some cases companies that violate the fcpa may be debarred by the united states government andor lose their united states export privileges changes in anticorruption laws or enforcement priorities could also result in increased compliance requirements and related costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition the united states or other governments may seek to hold us liable for successor liability fcpa violations or violations of other anticorruption laws committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquired or will acquire 

we face risks related to sales to government entities 

we derive a portion of our revenue from sales to government entities in the united states in general our contracts with united states government entities are terminable at will by the government entity at any time government demand and payment for our services may be affected by publicsector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations including government shutdowns government contracts are subject to oversight including special rules on accounting expenses reviews and security failure to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions including termination of contracts fines and suspensions or debarment from future business with the united states government as a result failure to comply with these rules could have an adverse effect on our future business reputation operating results and financial condition 

if we are unable to successfully develop and market new services or enter new markets our growth results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

a key element of our growth strategy is the successful development and marketing of new services or entering new markets that complement or expand our existing business as we develop new services or enter new markets including services targeted at participants in the broader healthcare industry we may not have or adequately build the competencies necessary to perform such services satisfactorily may not receive market acceptance for such services or may face increased competition if we are unable to 

succeed in developing new services entering new markets or attracting a client base for our new services or in new markets we will be unable to implement this element of our growth strategy and our future business reputation results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our research  development solutions business could subject us to potential liability that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our research  development solutions business involves the testing of new drugs on patients in clinical trials and if marketing approval is granted the availability of these drugs to be prescribed to patients our involvement in the clinical trials and development process creates a risk of liability for personal injury to or death of patients particularly those with lifethreatening illnesses resulting from adverse reactions to the drugs administered during testing or after product launch respectively for example we have from time to time been sued and may be sued in the future by individuals alleging personal injury due to their participation in clinical trials and seeking damages from us under a variety of legal theories although we maintain the types and amounts of insurance we view as customary in the industries and countries in which we operate if we are required to pay damages or incur defense costs in connection with any personal injury claim that is outside the scope of indemnification agreements we have with our clients if any indemnification agreement is not performed in accordance with its terms or if our liability exceeds the amount of any applicable indemnification limits or available insurance coverage our financial condition results of operations and reputation could be materially and adversely affected we maintain professional liability insurance including liability for completed operations coverage in the future we may not be able to get adequate insurance for these types of risks at reasonable rates 

we also contract with physicians to serve as investigators in conducting clinical trials if the investigators commit errors or make omissions during a clinical trial that result in harm to clinical trial patients or after a clinical trial to a patient using the drug after it has received regulatory approval claims for personal injury or liability damages may result additionally if the investigators engage in fraudulent behavior clinical trial data may be compromised which may require us to repeat the clinical trial or subject us to liability we do not believe we are legally responsible for the medical care rendered by such thirdparty investigators and we would vigorously defend any claims brought against us however it is possible we could be found liable for claims with respect to the actions of thirdparty investigators which may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

some of our services involve direct interaction with clinical trial subjects or volunteers and subcontracting into a network of phase i clinical facilities which could create potential liability that may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and reputation 

we subcontract into a network of facilities where phase i clinical trials are conducted which ordinarily involve testing an investigational drug on a limited number of healthy individuals typically 20 to 80 persons to determine such drug’s basic safety failure to operate such a facility in accordance with applicable regulations could result in that facility being shut down which could disrupt our operations additionally we face risks associated with adverse events resulting from the administration of such drugs to healthy volunteers and the professional malpractice of medical care providers any professional malpractice or negligence by such investigators nurses or other subcontracted employees could potentially result in liability to us in the event of personal injury to or death of a healthy volunteer in clinical trials and could also cause us reputational harm this liability particularly if it were to exceed the limits of any indemnification agreements and insurance coverage we may have may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

our contract sales  medical solutions business could result in liability to us if a drug causes harm to a patient while we are generally indemnified and insured against such risks we may still suffer financial losses 

when we market drugs under contract for a biopharmaceutical company we could suffer liability for harm allegedly caused by those drugs either as a result of a lawsuit against the biopharmaceutical company to which we are joined a lawsuit naming us or any of our subsidiaries or an action launched by a regulatory body while we are generally indemnified by the biopharmaceutical company for the action of the drugs we market on its behalf and we carry insurance to cover harm caused by our negligence in performing services it is possible that we could nonetheless incur financial losses regulatory penalties or both in particular any claim could result in potential liability for us if the claim is outside the scope of the indemnification agreement we have with the biopharmaceutical company the biopharmaceutical company does not abide by the indemnification agreement as required or the liability exceeds the amount of any applicable indemnification limits or available insurance coverage such a finding could have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and reputation furthermore negative publicity associated with harm caused by drugs we helped to market could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

our insurance may not cover all of our indemnification obligations and other liabilities associated with our operations 

we maintain insurance designed to provide coverage for ordinary risks associated with our operations and our ordinary indemnification obligations the coverage provided by such insurance may not be adequate for all claims we may make or may be contested by our insurance carriers if our insurance is not adequate or available to pay liabilities associated with our operations or if we are unable to purchase adequate insurance at reasonable rates in the future our profitability may be adversely impacted 

if we are unable to attract suitable investigators and patients for our clinical trials our clinical development business might suffer 

the timely recruitment of investigators and patients for clinical trials is essential to our research  development solutions business investigators are typically located at hospitals clinics or other sites and supervise the administration of the investigational drug to patients during the course of a clinical trial patients generally include people from the communities in which the clinical trials are conducted our clinical development business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract suitable and willing investigators or patients for clinical trials on a consistent basis for example if we are unable to engage investigators to conduct clinical trials as planned or enroll sufficient patients in clinical trials we might need to expend additional funds to obtain access to resources or else be compelled to delay or modify the clinical trial plans which may result in additional costs to us 

if we lose the services of key personnel or are unable to recruit additional qualified personnel our business could be adversely affected 

our success substantially depends on the collective performance contributions and expertise of our personnel including senior management and key personnel qualified professional scientific and technical operating staff and qualified sales representatives for our contract sales services there is significant and increasing competition for qualified personnel particularly those with higher educational degrees such as a medical degree a phd or an equivalent degree or relevant experience in the industry and in the locations in which we operate in addition the departure of our key employees or our inability to continue to identify attract and retain qualified personnel or replace any departed personnel in a timely fashion may impact our ability to grow our business and compete effectively in our industry and may negatively affect our ability to meet financial and operational goals 

disruptions in the credit and capital markets and unfavorable general economic conditions could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

disruptions in the credit and capital markets could have negative effects on our business that may be difficult to predict or anticipate including the ability of our clients vendors contractors and financing sources to meet their contractual obligations although we are unable to quantify the impact it has had on us we are aware of a limited number of instances in our research  development solutions business during the past several years where cancellations changes in scope and failure to pay timely were attributable at least in part to difficulty in our clients’ ability to obtain financing in the future such actions by our clients could if they involve a significant amount of business with us have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our effective income tax rate may fluctuate for a variety of reasons which may adversely affect our operations earnings and earnings per share 

our effective income tax rate is influenced by our projected profitability in the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate changes in a jurisdiction’s income tax rates and the distribution of our profits and losses among such jurisdictions may have a significant impact on our effective income tax rate which in turn could have an adverse effect on our net income and earnings per share other factors that may affect our effective income tax rate include but are not limited to 

• changes in the value of deferred tax assets and liabilities 

• changes in tax laws in various jurisdictions 

• audits by taxing authorities and 

• the establishment of valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets if we determined that it is more likely than not that future income tax benefits will not be realized 

in addition our effective income tax rate is influenced by us tax law which has been substantially modified by the tax cuts and jobs act enacted in 2017 “tax act” currently regulations regarding global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” and the use of foreign tax credits have been issued in proposed form and if the application of these provisions are modified to change the interpretation to us it could have an adverse impact on our effective income tax rate in the course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain which may require the use of estimates and significant judgement to account for their impact on the effective income tax rate in our consolidated financial statements as the regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tax act our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

all of these items described above may cause fluctuations in our effective income tax rate through increased us tax liability andor the loss of tax attributes in any given year that could adversely affect our results of operations and impact our earnings and earnings per share additional information regarding our income taxes is presented in note 16 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” or other standardsetting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements 

we are required to prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” which is periodically revised andor expanded from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the fasb and the sec it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt such as amended guidance for income taxes may require additional changes to the current accounting treatment that we apply to our financial statements and may require us to make significant changes to our reporting systems such changes could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

our relationships with existing or potential clients who are in competition with each other may adversely impact the degree to which other clients or potential clients use our services which may adversely affect our results of operations 

the biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive with biopharmaceutical companies each seeking to persuade payers providers and patients that their drug therapies are better and more costeffective than competing therapies marketed or being developed by competing firms in addition to the adverse competitive interests that biopharmaceutical companies have with each other biopharmaceutical companies also have adverse interests with respect to drug selection and reimbursement with other participants in the healthcare industry including payers and providers biopharmaceutical companies also compete to be first to market with new drug therapies we regularly provide services to biopharmaceutical companies who compete with each other and we sometimes provide services or funding to such clients regarding competing drugs in development our existing or future relationships with our biopharmaceutical clients may therefore deter other biopharmaceutical clients from using our services or may result in our clients seeking to place limits on our ability to serve other biopharmaceutical industry participants in connection with drug development activities in addition our further expansion into the broader healthcare market may adversely impact our relationships with biopharmaceutical clients and such clients may elect not to use our services reduce the scope of services that we provide to them or seek to place restrictions on our ability to serve clients in the broader healthcare market with interests that are adverse to theirs a loss of clients or reductions in the level of revenues from a client could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations business and prospects 

if we are unable to successfully identify acquire and integrate existing businesses services and technologies our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 

we anticipate that a portion of our future growth may come from acquiring existing businesses services or technologies the success of any acquisition will depend upon among other things our ability to effectively integrate acquired personnel operations services and technologies into our business and to retain the key personnel and clients of our acquired businesses in addition we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or obtain any necessary financing on commercially acceptable terms we may also spend time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition targets but not complete the transaction any future acquisition could involve other risks including among others the assumption of additional liabilities and expenses difficulties and 

expenses in connection with integrating the acquired companies and achieving the expected benefits issuances of potentially dilutive securities or interestbearing debt loss of key employees of the acquired companies transaction costs diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and with respect to the acquisition of foreign companies the inability to overcome differences in foreign business practices language and customs our failure to identify potential acquisitions complete targeted acquisitions and integrate completed acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our results of operations may be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our goodwill and intangible assets 

we assess the realizability of our indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill annually and conduct an interim evaluation whenever events or changes in circumstances such as operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset indicate that these assets may be impaired our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of the businesses we have acquired which in turn could depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses into our own business if we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets such impairment charges could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we face risks arising from the restructuring of our operations 

from time to time we have adopted restructuring plans to improve our operating efficiency through various means such as reduction of overcapacity elimination of nonbillable support roles or other realignment of resources restructuring presents significant potential risks of events occurring that could adversely affect us including 

• actual or perceived disruption of service or reduction in service standards to clients 

• the failure to preserve supplier relationships and distribution sales and other important relationships and to resolve conflicts that may arise 

• loss of sales as we reduce or eliminate staffing on noncore services 

• diversion of management attention from ongoing business activities and 

• the failure to maintain employee morale and retain key employees 

further any such restructuring would result in charges that if material could harm our results of operations and significantly reduce our cash position or increase debt in addition we may incur certain unforeseen costs once any restructuring activities are implemented further if we determine to effect any restructuring we can give no assurance that any projected cost reductions resulting from such restructuring activities will be achieved within the expected timeframe or at all 

because of these and other factors we cannot predict whether we will realize the purpose and anticipated benefits of these measures and if we do not our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

additionally there may be delays in implementing the restructuring activities or a failure to achieve the anticipated levels of cost savings and efficiency as a result of the restructuring activities each of which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations further restructuring or reorganization activities may also be required in the future beyond what is currently planned which could further enhance the risks associated with these activities 

risks relating to our industry 

the biopharmaceutical services industry is highly competitive 

the biopharmaceutical services industry is highly competitive our business often competes with other biopharmaceutical services companies internal discovery departments development departments sales and marketing departments information technology departments and other departments within our clients some of which could be considered large biopharmaceutical services companies in their own right with greater resources than ours we also compete with universities teaching hospitals governments agencies and others if we do not compete successfully our business will suffer the biopharmaceutical services industry is highly 

fragmented with numerous smaller specialized companies and a handful of companies with global capabilities similar to certain of our own capabilities increased competition has led to price and other forms of competition such as acceptance of less favorable contract terms that could adversely affect our operating results there are few barriers to entry for companies considering offering any one or more of the services we offer because of their size and focus these companies might compete effectively against us which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our future growth and success will depend on our ability to successfully compete with other companies that provide similar services in the same markets some of which may have financial marketing technical and other advantages we also expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of consolidation among these various companies large technology companies with substantial resources technical expertise and greater brand power could also decide to enter or further expand in the markets where our business operates and compete with us if one or more of our competitors or potential competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors or if a new entrant emerged with substantial resources the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively we compete on the basis of various factors including breadth and depth of services reputation reliability quality geographic coverage innovation security price and industry expertise and experience in addition our ability to compete successfully may be impacted by the growing availability of health information from social media government health information systems and other free or lowcost sources consolidation or integration of wholesalers retail pharmacies health networks payers or other healthcare stakeholders may lead any of them to provide information services directly to clients or indirectly through a designated service provider resulting in increased competition from firms that may have lower costs to market eg no data supply costs any of the above may result in lower demand for our services which could result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

outsourcing trends in the biopharmaceutical industry and changes in aggregate spending and research and development budgets could adversely affect our operating results and growth rate 

economic factors and industry trends that affect biopharmaceutical companies affect our research  development solutions business biopharmaceutical companies continue to seek longterm strategic collaborations with global clinical research organizations with favorable pricing terms competition for these collaborations is intense and we may decide to forego an opportunity or we may not be selected in which case a competitor may enter into the collaboration and our business with the client if any may be limited in addition if the biopharmaceutical industry reduces its research  development solutions activities or reduces its outsourcing of clinical trials and sales and marketing projects or such outsourcing fails to grow at projected rates our operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected we may also be negatively impacted by consolidation and other factors in the biopharmaceutical industry which may slow decision making by our clients or result in the delay or cancellation of clinical trials our commercial services may be affected by reductions in new drug launches and increases in the number of drugs losing patent protection all of these events could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our business may be materially and adversely impacted by factors affecting the biopharmaceutical and healthcare industries 

the vast majority of our revenue is generated from sales to the biopharmaceutical and healthcare industries the clients we serve in these industries are commonly subject to financial pressures including but not limited to increased costs reduced demand for their products reductions in pricing and reimbursement for products and services formulary approval and placement government approval to market their products and limits on the manner by which they market their products loss of patent exclusivity whether due to patent expiration or as a result of a successful legal challenge and the proliferation of or changes to regulations applicable to these industries to the extent our clients face such pressures or they change how they utilize our offerings the demand for our services or the prices our clients are willing to pay for those services may decline any such decline could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we may be affected by healthcare reform and potential additional reforms 

the united states congress continues to consider healthcare reform legislation and impose health industry cost containment measures which may significantly impact the biopharmaceutical industry in addition numerous government bodies are considering or have adopted various healthcare reforms and may undertake or are in the process of undertaking efforts to control growing healthcare costs through legislation regulation and voluntary agreements with medical care providers and biopharmaceutical companies we are uncertain as to the effects of these recent reforms on our business and are unable to predict what legislative proposals if any will be adopted in the future if regulatory cost containment efforts limit the profitability of new drugs our clients may reduce their research 

and development spending or promotional marketing and sales expenditures which could reduce the business they outsource to us similarly if regulatory requirements are relaxed or simplified drug approval procedures are adopted the demand for our services could decrease 

foreign and domestic government bodies may also adopt healthcare legislation or regulations that are more burdensome than existing regulations for example product safety concerns and recommendations by the drug safety oversight board could change the regulatory environment for drug products and new or heightened regulatory and licensing requirements may increase our expenses or limit or delay our ability to offer some of our services additionally new or heightened regulatory requirements may have a negative impact on the ability of our clients to conduct industrysponsored clinical trials which could reduce the need for our services 

actions by government regulators or clients to limit a prescription’s scope or withdraw an approved drug from the market could adversely affect our business and result in a loss of revenues 

government regulators have the authority after approving a drug to regulate or limit its scope of prescription or withdraw it from the market completely based on safety concerns similarly clients may act to voluntarily limit the scope of prescription of drugs or withdraw them from the market in the past we have provided services with respect to drugs that have been limited andor withdrawn if we are providing services to clients for drugs that are limited or withdrawn we may be required to narrow the scope of or terminate our services with respect to such drugs which would prevent earning the full amount of revenues anticipated under the related service contracts with negative impacts to our financial results 

if we do not keep pace with rapid technological changes our services may become less competitive or obsolete 

the biopharmaceutical industry is subject to rapid technological changes our current competitors or other businesses might develop technologies or services that are more effective or commercially attractive than or render obsolete our current or future technologies and services if our competitors introduce superior technologies or services including in the provision of clinical services and if we cannot make enhancements to remain competitive our competitive position would be harmed if we are unable to compete successfully we may lose clients or be unable to attract new clients which could lead to a decrease in our revenue and financial condition 

laws restricting biopharmaceutical sales and marketing practices may adversely impact demand for our services 

there have been a significant number of laws legislative initiatives and regulatory actions over the years that seek to limit biopharmaceutical sales and marketing practices for example three states in 2006 and 2007 passed laws restricting the use of prescriber identifiable information for the purpose of promoting branded prescription medicines although these laws were subsequently declared to be unconstitutional based on a decision of the us supreme court in sorrell v ims health in 2011 we are unable to predict whether and in what form other initiatives may be introduced or actions taken at the state or federal levels to limit biopharmaceutical sales and marketing practices in addition while we will continue to seek to adapt our services to comply with the requirements of these laws to the extent applicable to our services if enacted there can be no assurance that our efforts to adapt our offerings will be successful and provide the same financial contribution to us there can also be no assurance that future legislative initiatives will not adversely affect our ability to develop or market current or future offerings or that any future laws will not diminish the demand for our services all of which could over time result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

our research  development solutions clients face intense competition from lower cost generic products which may lower the amount that they spend on our services 

our research  development solutions clients face increasing competition from lower cost generic products which in turn may affect their ability to pursue research and development activities with us in the united states eu and japan political pressure to reduce spending on prescription drugs has led to legislation and other measures which encourages the use of generic products in addition proposals emerge from time to time in the united states and other countries for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by generic substitutes reducing our clients’ sales of that product and their overall profitability availability of generic substitutes for our clients’ drugs may adversely affect their results of operations and cash flow which in turn may mean that they would not have surplus capital to invest in research and development and drug commercialization including in our services if competition from generic products impacts our clients’ 

finances such that they decide to curtail our services our revenues may decline and this could have a material adverse effect on our business 

risks relating to our indebtedness 

  restrictions imposed in the senior secured credit facilities as defined below and other outstanding indebtedness including the indentures governing outstanding notes issued by our wholly owned subsidiary iqvia inc may limit our ability to operate our business and to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 

the terms of the senior secured credit facilities restrict iqvia and its restricted subsidiaries from engaging in specified types of transactions these covenants restrict the ability of iqvia and its restricted subsidiaries among other things to 

• incur liens 

• make investments and loans 

• incur indebtedness or guarantees 

• issue preferred stock of a restricted subsidiary 

• issue disqualified equity 

• engage in mergers acquisitions and asset sales 

• declare dividends make payments or redeem or repurchase equity interests 

• alter the business iqvia and its restricted subsidiaries conduct 

• make restricted payments 

• enter into agreements limiting restricted subsidiary distributions 

• prepay redeem or purchase certain indebtedness and 

• engage in certain transactions with affiliates 

in addition the revolving credit facility and the term a and b loans under the credit agreement as defined below require iqvia to comply with a quarterly maximum senior secured net leverage ratio test and minimum interest coverage ratio test iqvia’s ability to comply with these financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and iqvia may not be able to satisfy them additionally the restrictions contained in the indentures governing the outstanding notes could also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions meet capital needs or make acquisitions or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facilities or the indentures governing the outstanding notes which could trigger acceleration of our indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of or default under any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial results in the event of any default under the senior secured credit facilities the applicable lenders could elect to terminate borrowing commitments and declare all borrowings and loans outstanding together with accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and other obligations to be due and payable in addition or in the alternative the applicable lenders could exercise their rights under the security documents entered into in connection with the senior secured credit facilities iqvia and the other subsidiary guarantors have pledged substantially all of their tangible and intangible assets subject to customary exceptions as collateral under the senior secured credit facilities including the stock and the assets of certain of our current and future wholly owned united states subsidiaries and a portion of the stock of certain of our nonunited states subsidiaries 

  

if we were unable to repay or otherwise refinance these borrowings and loans when due the applicable lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation in the event the 

applicable lenders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness any acceleration of amounts due under the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities or the exercise by the applicable lenders of their rights under the security documents would likely have a material adverse effect on us 

despite our level of indebtedness we are able to incur more debt and undertake additional obligations incurring such debt or undertaking such additional obligations could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition 

although the credit agreement which governs the senior secured credit facilities of our wholly owned subsidiary through which we conduct our operations iqvia inc contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could increase in addition the receivables financing facility for one of our consolidated subsidiaries a bankruptcyremote special purpose entity the “spe” limits borrowing based on the amount of receivables purchased by the spe from certain of our other subsidiaries but when supported by the value of such purchased receivables the debt under our receivables financing facility can increase 

while the credit agreement also contains restrictions on our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to make loans and investments these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the investments incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 

restrictive covenants in our other indebtedness may limit our flexibility in our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to pursue our business strategies 

the terms contained in certain of our indebtedness including credit facilities and any future indebtedness of ours may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions including restrictions on our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to take actions that we believe may be in our interest these agreements among other things limit our ability to 

• incur additional debt 

• provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons 

• issue redeemable stock and preferred stock 

• pay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock 

• prepay redeem or repurchase debt 

• make loans investments and capital expenditures 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

• create or incur liens 

• make distributions from our subsidiaries 

• sell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries 

• make acquisitions and 

• consolidate or merge with or into or sell substantially all of our assets to another person 

a breach of the covenants or restrictions under the agreements governing our other indebtedness could result in a default under the applicable indebtedness such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in the event our lenders and noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we cannot assure that we and our subsidiaries would have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness 

our financial results our substantial indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of future financing 

interest rate fluctuations and our ability to deduct interest expense may affect our results of operations and financial condition 

because we have variable rate debt fluctuations in interest rates affect our business we attempt to minimize interest rate risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate caps and swaps we have entered into interest rate caps and swaps with financial institutions that have reset dates and critical terms that match those of our senior secured term loan credit facility accordingly any change in market value associated with the interest rate caps and swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt because we do not attempt to hedge all of our variable rate debt we may incur higher interest costs for the portion of our variable rate debt which is not hedged 

in addition the deduction for our interest expense may be limited which could have an adverse impact on our taxes and net income 

we may be adversely affected by changes in the method of determining the london interbank offered rate “libor” or the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate for our variable rate loans derivative contracts and other financial assets and liabilities 

the interest rates under our credit facilities and related interest rate swaps may be impacted by the expected discontinuation of libor libor is used as a reference rate to calculate interest rates under our credit facilities in 2017 the united kingdoms financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 it is unclear if libor will cease to exist at that time or if new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 the banking industry alongside regulators have taken steps to introduce alternative reference rates to libor particularly in the us the uk and switzerland whether or not alternative reference rates attain market traction as a libor replacement tool remains in question if libor ceases to exist or another indexed rate gains wide market acceptance as the successor to libor our lenders will select a replacement index that will be applied under our credit facilities and related interest rate swaps and certain of the interest rates under our credit facilities may change the new rates may not be as favorable to us as those in effect prior to any libor phaseout 

risks relating to ownership of our common stock 

provisions of the corporate governance documents of iqvia could make an acquisition of iqvia difficult and may prevent attempts by its stockholders to replace or remove its management even if beneficial to its stockholders 

our certificate of incorporation and delaware bylaws and the general corporation law of delaware the “dgcl” contain provisions that could make it difficult for a third party to acquire iqvia even if doing so might be beneficial to its stockholders including 

• the division of the board of directors into three classes and the election of each class for threeyear terms 

• the sole ability of the board of directors to fill a vacancy created by the death or resignation of a director or the expansion of the board of directors 

• advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations 

• limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings and to take action by written consent 

• the approval of holders of at least seventyfive percent 75 of the outstanding shares of iqvia entitled to vote on any amendment alteration change addition or repeal of the delaware bylaws is required to amend alter change add to or repeal the delaware bylaws 

• the required approval of holders of at least seventyfive percent 75 of the outstanding shares of iqvia to remove directors which removal may only be for cause and 

• the ability of the board of directors to issue new series of and designate the terms of preferred stock without stockholder approval which could be used to among other things institute a rights plan that would have the effect of significantly diluting the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by the board of directors 

in addition iqvia is subject to section 203 of the dgcl regulating corporate takeovers section 203 subject to certain exceptions prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any “business combination” with any “interested stockholder” for a period of three years following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder unless 

• prior to such date the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder 

• upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder the interested stockholder owned at least 85 of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced excluding those shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers and employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer or 

• on or subsequent to such date the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders and not by written consent by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder 

in general section 203 defines “business combination” to include mergers or consolidations between a delaware corporation and an interested stockholder transactions with an interested stockholder involving the assets or stock of the corporation or its majorityowned subsidiaries and transactions which increase an interested stockholder’s percentage ownership of stock in general section 203 defines an “interested stockholder” as any entity or person beneficially owning 15 or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by stockholders to replace members of the board of directors because iqvia’s board is responsible for appointing the members of management these provisions could in turn affect any attempt to replace current members of management as a result stockholders of iqvia may lose their ability to sell their stock for a price in excess of the prevailing market price due to these protective measures and efforts by stockholders to change the direction or management of iqvia may be unsuccessful 

our operating results and share price may be volatile which could cause the value of our stockholders’ investments to decline 

our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future and such fluctuations may be significant in addition securities markets worldwide have experienced and are likely to continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could subject the market price of our shares to wide price fluctuations regardless of our operating performance our operating results and the trading price of our shares may fluctuate in response to various factors including 

• market conditions in the broader stock market 

• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly and annual financial and operating results 

• introduction of new services by us or our competitors 

• issuance of new or changed securities analysts’ reports or recommendations 

• sales or anticipated sales of large blocks of our stock 

• additions or departures of key personnel 

• regulatory or political developments 

• litigation and governmental investigations 

• changing economic conditions and 

• exchange rate fluctuations 

these and other factors many of which are beyond our control may cause our operating results and the market price for our shares to fluctuate substantially while we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares and may otherwise negatively affect the market price and liquidity of our shares in addition in the past when the market price of a stock has been volatile holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock if any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation 

since we have no current plans to pay regular cash dividends on our common stock stockholders may not receive any return on investment unless they sell their common stock for a price greater than that which they paid for it 

although we have previously declared dividends to our stockholders prior to our initial public offering in may 2013 we do not currently anticipate paying any regular cash dividends on our common stock any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board and will depend on among other things our results of operations financial condition cash requirements contractual restrictions and other factors that our board may deem relevant in addition our ability to pay dividends is and may be limited by covenants of existing and any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur including under our existing credit facilities therefore any return on investment in our common stock is solely dependent upon the appreciation of the price of our common stock on the open market which may not occur 

our certificate of incorporation contains a provision renouncing any interest and expectancy in certain corporate opportunities identified by certain parties even if such corporate opportunities are ones that we might reasonably be deemed to have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue 

our certificate of incorporation provides that iqvia renounces any interest or expectancy in the business opportunities of the tpg global llc the bain capital llc cpp investment board private holdings inc and leonard green  partners lp and their affiliates other than our company and our subsidiaries and all of their respective partners principals directors officers members managers managing directors andor employees and each such person will have no obligation to offer us such opportunities this provision applies to each of these current or former stockholders and associated parties only for so long as a nominee designated by such stockholder under the shareholders agreement continues to serve on our board of directors and no individual serving our board of directors has at any time been designated as a nominee by such stockholder under the shareholders agreement stockholders are deemed to have notice of and have consented to this provision of our certificate of incorporation 

therefore a director or officer of our company who also serves as a director officer member manager or employee of such stockholders may pursue certain business opportunities including acquisitions that may be complementary to its business and as a result such opportunities may not be available to us these potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on the business financial condition results of operations or prospects of our company if attractive corporate opportunities are allocated by such stockholders to themselves or their other affiliates instead of to us

purchases of equity securities by the issuer 

on october 30 2013 our board of directors the “board” approved an equity repurchase program the “repurchase program” authorizing the repurchase of up to 1250 million of either our common stock or vested inthemoney employee stock options or a combination thereof our board increased the stock repurchase authorization under the repurchase program with respect to the repurchase of our common stock by 600 million 15 billion 2 billion 15 billion and 20 billion in 2015 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively which increased the total amount that has been authorized under the repurchase program to 7725 billion the repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any particular amount of common stock or vested inthemoney employee stock options and it may be modified extended suspended or discontinued at any time the timing and amount of repurchases are determined by our management based on a variety of factors such as the market price of our common stock our corporate requirements and overall market conditions purchases of our common stock may be made in open market transactions effected through a brokerdealer at prevailing market prices in block trades or in privately negotiated transactions the repurchase program for common stock does not have an expiration date in addition from time to time we have repurchased and may continue to repurchase common stock through private or other transactions outside of the repurchase program 

from inception of the repurchase program through december 31 2020 we have repurchased a total of 64 billion of our securities under the repurchase program 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we repurchased 2718447 shares of our common stock for approximately 4231 million under the repurchase program these amounts include 1000000 shares of our common stock repurchased from certain selling stockholders in a private transaction for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 1643 million for additional information regarding our equity repurchases see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and

overview of the impact of covid19 

as a result of the global spread of covid19 beginning in early march we began to experience general business disruptions that impeded normal business activity including our ability to perform onsite monitoring and deliver offerings that rely on facetoface interaction or inperson gatherings 

these disruptions have impacted all three of our reportable segments the research  development solutions business responded quickly to support our clients with the development of vaccines and therapies for covid19 we have been involved in clinical trials and studies for the virus as well as patient recruitment for covid19 trials the pandemic has accelerated the need for remote and riskbased monitoring in clinical research which in turn has accelerated the adoption of our virtual trial technology this technology was deployed to speed vaccine development and helped secure fullservice covid trials and new studies with top pharmaceutical clients we continue to see gradual improvement in the accessibility of clinical research sites in the research  development solutions business we are seeing a return to onsite monitoring visits which exceeded the number of remote visits during the second half of the year in instances where sites remain physically inaccessible for clinical monitoring remote monitoring and virtual solutions continue to be effective alternatives site startup activities continued to increase along with patient recruitment trends in our technology  analytics solutions segment our realworld business has been relatively well insulated from the impacts of the virus and it had strong growth for the year the realworld business is advanced in the use of secondary data remote monitoring and virtual research approaches which helped us pivot quickly to working in the new remote world at the onset of the pandemic however the portion of our realworld business that requires site monitoring activity also experienced limitations on site accessibility which led to a reduction in the associated revenue within our technology  analytics solutions segment we have had very little interruption in data supply and demand our analytics and consulting businesses have performed well despite business development being hampered by lack of inperson interactions our technology  analytics solutions offerings that rely on facetoface interactions or are dependent on inperson gatherings events or conferences continue to experience disruption and where we were unable to execute on our commitments due to covid19 we were not able to recognize the associated revenue in the period activity within the contract sales and medical solutions business continues to be more challenging due to a decline in sales rep visits and physician attention diverted to the covid19 crisis 

we have accelerated and expanded a variety of cost containment actions to reduce the impact to profitability we have activated business continuity plans including remote delivery capabilities in technology and analytics remote monitoring and virtual trials in research  development solutions and virtual commercial activity with clients wherever possible we anticipate an acceleration of business momentum when the crisis subsides as delayed trial activities will still need to be performed 

the company continues to maintain strong liquidity as of december 31 2020 cash and cash equivalents were 1814 million and the company had no amounts drawn under its 15 billion revolving credit facility at december 31 2020 the company was in compliance with the financial covenants under its debt agreements in all material respects and does not have material uncertainty about ongoing ability to meet the covenants of our credit arrangements 

to help ensure the safety and wellbeing of our employees customers partners and the broader community and continuity of our business operations we continue to monitor health authority guidance on mitigating the spread of covid19 and managing positive cases we manage our response to the pandemic through a combination of enterprisewide and regional governance teams with particular focus on the medical and scientific information technology human capital and financial impacts of the pandemic on our business these teams met and continue to meet regularly as necessary based on the status of the pandemic we closely monitor the impact of covid19 on our operations and report to our board regularly on the progress of our response to the covid19 outbreak we have established global workplace protocols that govern the return of our employees to our offices 

business combinations 

we have completed and will continue to consider strategic business combinations to enhance our capabilities and offerings in certain areas including various individually immaterial acquisitions during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 these transactions were accounted for as business combinations and the acquired results of operations are included in our consolidated financial information since the acquisition date see note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information with respect to these business combinations 

sources of revenue 

total revenues are comprised of revenues from the provision of our services we do not have any material product revenues 

costs and expenses 

our costs and expenses are comprised primarily of our costs of revenue reimbursed expenses and selling general and administrative expenses costs of revenue include compensation and benefits for billable employees and personnel involved in production trial monitoring data management and delivery and the costs of acquiring and processing data for our information offerings costs of staff directly involved with delivering technologyrelated services offerings and engagements related accommodations and the costs of data purchased specifically for technology services engagements and other expenses directly related to service contracts such as courier fees laboratory supplies professional services and travel expenses as noted above reimbursed expenses are comprised principally of payments to investigators who oversee clinical trials and travel expenses for our clinical monitors and sales representatives selling general and administrative expenses include costs related to sales marketing and administrative functions including human resources legal finance quality assurance compliance and general management for compensation and benefits travel professional services training and expenses for information technology facilities and depreciation and amortization 

foreign currency translation 

in 2020 approximately 35 of our revenues were denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar which represents approximately 60 currencies because a large portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and our financial statements are reported in united states dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly affect our results of operations the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies and translated into united states dollars for financial reporting purposes accordingly exchange rate fluctuations will affect the translation of foreign results into united states dollars for purposes of reporting our condensed consolidated results as a result we believe that reporting results of operations that exclude the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations on certain financial results can facilitate analysis of period to period comparisons this constant currency information assumes the same foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect for the comparable prioryear period were used in translation of the current period results 

consolidated results of operations 

for information regarding our results of operations for technology  analytics solutions research  development solutions and contract sales  medical solutions refer to “segment results of operations” later in this section 

for a discussion of our results of operations comparison for 2019 and 2018 refer to our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2019 filed on february 18 2020 our reportable segment results of operations comparison for 2018 included below within this annual report on form 10k reflects the change in segment presentation that occurred during the first quarter of 2019 

revenues 



2020 compared to 2019 

in 2020 our revenues increased 271 million or 24 as compared to 2019 this increase was comprised of constant currency revenue growth of approximately 252 million or 23 reflecting a 365 million increase in technology  analytics solutions offset by a 38 million decrease in research  development solutions and a 75 million decrease in contract sales  medical solutions 

costs of revenue exclusive of depreciation and amortization 



2020 compared to 2019 

when compared to 2019 costs of revenue exclusive of depreciation and amortization in 2020 increased 200 million or 27 this increase included a constant currency increase of approximately 223 million or 31 comprised of a 232 million increase in technology  analytics solutions a 67 million increase in research  development solutions offset by a 76 million decrease in contract sales  medical solutions 

as a percent of revenues costs of revenue remained flat compared to 2019 

selling general and administrative expenses 



2020 compared to 2019 

the 55 million increase in selling general and administrative expenses in 2020 as compared to 2019 included a constant currency increase of approximately 62 million or 36 comprised of a 23 million increase in technology  analytics solutions a 31 million increase in research  development solutions and a 12 million increase in general corporate and unallocated expenses these increases were partially offset by a 4 million decrease in contract sales  medical solutions 

depreciation and amortization 



the 85 million increase in depreciation and amortization in 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to higher intangible asset balances as a result of acquisitions occurring in 2019 increased amortization due to higher capitalized software balances and accelerated depreciation on an internaluse software asset in the first quarter of 2020 

restructuring costs 



the restructuring costs incurred were due to ongoing efforts to streamline our global operations the remaining actions under these plans are expected to occur throughout 2021 and are expected to consist of consolidating functional activities eliminating redundant positions and aligning resources with customer requirements 

  

interest income and interest expense 



interest income included interest received primarily from bank balances and investments 

interest expense during 2020 was lower than 2019 due to lower interest rates attributed to lower libor rates and the redemption of the 800 million of 4875 senior notes due 2023 partially offset by an increase in the average debt outstanding 

loss on extinguishment of debt 



during 2020 we recognized loss on extinguishment of debt of 13 million for fees and expenses related to the refinancing of our 3500 senior notes due 2024 as discussed further in note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

during 2019 we recognized loss on extinguishment of debt of 24 million for fees and expenses related to the redemption of our 4875 senior notes due 2023 in aggregate principal amount of 800 million as discussed further in note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

see “—liquidity and capital resources” for more information on these transactions 

other expense income net 



other income net for 2020 primarily consisted of a decrease in fair value of acquisitionrelated contingent consideration marktomarket gains on equity securities a decrease in foreign currency losses and a gain on investments in mutual funds 

other income net for 2019 primarily consisted of a gain related to the remeasurement of a previously held equity interest of an equity method investment upon acquiring the remaining interest as a result of a business combination 

income tax expense benefit 



in 2020 the us treasury department issued final regulations regarding foreign derived intangible income “fdii” and global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” we have determined we will elect the gilti high tax exception as allowed by the final regulations and we will amend our 2018 and 2019 us federal consolidated income tax returns resulting in a favorable impact of 26 million which we recorded in 2020 

in 2019 the us treasury department issued final regulations on the transition tax and proposed regulations on foreign derived intangible income “fdii which we analyzed while the final regulations related to the transition tax did not have a material impact on us the proposed guidance for fdii had an unfavorable impact although the proposed guidance for fdii is not authoritative and subject to change in the regulatory review process we reversed the tax benefit recorded in 2018 by recording a tax expense of 25 million for this impact 

equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates 



equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates increased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to higher earnings from our investment in novaquest pharma opportunities fund iii 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 



net income attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily consists of quest’s interest in q 2 solutions 

segment results of operations 

revenues and profit by segment are as follows 



certain costs are not allocated to our segments and are reported as general corporate and unallocated expenses these costs primarily consist of stockbased compensation and expenses to integration activities and acquisitions we also do not allocate depreciation and amortization or impairment charges to our segments prior period segment results have been recast to conform to changes to management reporting in 2019 the recast impacts the allocation of selling general and administrative expenses for 2018

research  development solutions 



backlog 

research  development solutions contracted backlog increased from 190 billion at december 31 2019 to 226 billion at december 31 2020 and we expect approximately 59 billion of this backlog to convert to revenue in the next 12 months contracted backlog was 171 billion at december 31 2018 

backlog represents at a particular point in time future revenues from work not yet completed or performed under signed contracts once work begins on a project revenues are recognized over the duration of the project 

we believe that backlog is an indicator of future revenues but the timing of revenue will be affected by a number of factors including the variable size and duration of projects many of which are performed over several years cancellations and changes to the scope of work during the course of projects projects that have been delayed remain in backlog but the timing of the revenue generated may differ from the timing originally expected additionally projects may be terminated or delayed by the customer or delayed by regulatory authorities in the event that a client cancels a contract we typically would be entitled to receive payment for all services performed up to the cancellation date and subsequent clientauthorized services related to winding down the canceled project for more details regarding risks related to our backlog see part i item ia “risk factors—risks related to our business—the relationship of backlog to revenues varies over time”

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows in addition to operating cash flows other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include capital expenditures acquisitions investments debt service requirements dividends equity repurchases adequacy of our revolving credit and receivables financing facilities and access to the capital markets 

we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which those funds can be accessed on a costeffective basis the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences however those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations we have and expect to transfer cash from those subsidiaries to the united states and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so 

we had a cash balance of 1814 million at december 31 2020 1065 million of which was in the united states an increase from 837 million at december 31 2019 

based on our current operating plan we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents future cash flows from operations and our ability to access funds under our revolving credit and receivables financing facilities will enable us to fund our operating requirements capital expenditures contractual obligations and meet debt obligations for at least the next 12 months we regularly evaluate our debt arrangements as well as market conditions and from time to time we may explore opportunities to modify our existing debt arrangements or pursue additional financing arrangements that could result in the issuance of new debt securities by us or our affiliates we may use our existing cash cash generated from operations or dispositions of assets or businesses andor proceeds from any new financing arrangements or issuances of debt or equity securities to repay or reduce some of our outstanding obligations to repurchase shares from our stockholders or for other purposes as part of our ongoing business strategy we also continually evaluate new acquisition expansion and investment possibilities or other strategic growth opportunities as well as potential dispositions of assets or businesses as appropriate including dispositions that may cause us to recognize a loss on certain 

assets should we elect to pursue any such transaction we may seek to obtain debt or equity financing to facilitate those activities our ability to enter into any such potential transactions and our use of cash or proceeds is limited to varying degrees by the terms and restrictions contained in our existing debt arrangements we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to complete any such financing arrangements or other transactions on favorable terms or at all 

equity repurchase program 

on february 13 2019 the board increased the stock repurchase authorization under the “repurchase program by 20 billion which increased the total amount that has been authorized under the repurchase program to 7725 billion since the plan’s inception in october 2013 the repurchase program does not obligate the company to repurchase any particular amount of common stock and it may be modified extended suspended or discontinued at any time 

as of december 31 2020 the company has remaining authorization to repurchase up to 09 billion of its common stock under the repurchase program in addition from time to time the company has repurchased and may continue to repurchase common stock through private or other transactions outside of the repurchase program 

additional information regarding the repurchase program is presented in part ii item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” and note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

our longterm debt arrangements contain customary restrictive covenants and as of december 31 2020 we believe we were in compliance with our restrictive covenants in all material respects 

senior secured credit facilities and senior notes 

at december 31 2020 our fourth amended and restated credit agreement as amended the “credit agreement” provided financing through several senior secured credit facilities collectively the “senior secured credit facilities” of up to approximately 7692 million which consisted of 6192 million principal amounts of debt outstanding as detailed in the table above 4 million of issued standby letters of credit and 1496 million of available borrowing capacity on the revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility is comprised of a 675 million senior secured revolving facility available in us dollars a 600 million senior secured revolving facility available in us dollars euros swiss francs and other foreign currencies and a 225 million senior secured revolving facility available in us dollars and yen the term a loans and revolving credit facility under the credit agreement mature in june 2023 while the term b loans under the credit agreement mature in 2024 and 2025 we are required to make scheduled quarterly payments on the term a loans equal to 125 of the original principal amount with the remaining balance paid at maturity we are required to make scheduled quarterly payments on the term b loans equal to approximately 025 of the original principal amount with the remaining balance paid at maturity in addition beginning with fiscal year ending december 31 2017 we were required to apply 50 of excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement subject to a reduction to 25 or 0 depending upon our senior secured first lien net leverage ratio for prepayment of the term loans with any such prepayment to be applied toward principal payments due in subsequent quarters we are also required to pay an annual commitment fee that ranges from 020 to 035 in respect of any unused commitments under the revolving credit facility the senior secured credit facilities are collateralized by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our material domestic subsidiaries including 100 of the equity interests of substantially all of our material domestic subsidiaries and 66 of the equity interests of substantially all of our firsttier material foreign subsidiaries and their domestic subsidiaries

years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 

cash flow from operating activities 



2020 compared to 2019 

cash provided by operating activities increased 542 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 the increase is primarily due to improved collections from clients resulting in a decrease in accounts receivable and unbilled services 377 million an increase in advanced billings 182 million an increase in cashrelated net income 102 million and the timing of income tax and other payables 78 million partially offset by a decrease in customer prepayments 54 million 

cash flow from investing activities 



2020 compared to 2019 

cash used in investing activities decreased 394 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 the decrease was primarily driven by lower cash used for the acquisition of businesses net of cash acquired 411 million 

cash flow from financing activities 



2020 compared to 2019 

cash used in financing activities decreased 59 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to less cash used to repurchase common stock 502 million offset by a decrease in cash provided by proceeds from debt issuances 309 million and a decrease in cash proceeds from revolving credit facilities net of repayments 131 million 

contingencies 

we are exposed to certain known contingencies that are material to our investors the facts and circumstances surrounding these contingencies and a discussion of their effect on us are in note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k these contingencies may have a material effect on our liquidity capital resources or results of operations in addition even where our reserves are adequate the incurrence of any of these liabilities may have a material effect on our liquidity and the amount of cash available to us for other purposes 

we believe that we have made appropriate arrangements in respect of the future effect on us of these known contingencies we also believe that the amount of cash available to us from our operations together with cash from financing will be sufficient for us 

to pay any known contingencies as they become due without materially affecting our ability to conduct our operations and invest in the growth of our business 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business 

contractual obligations and commitments 

below is a summary of our future payment commitments by year under contractual obligations as of december 31 2020 



1 interest payments on our debt are based on the interest rates in effect on december 31 2020 

2 purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable pricing provisions and the approximate timing of the transactions 

3 we are currently committed to invest 130 million in private equity funds as of december 31 2020 we have funded approximately 802 million of these commitments and we have approximately 498 million remaining to be funded which has not been included in the above table as we are unable to predict when these commitments will be paid 

4 amounts represent expected future benefit payments for our pension and postretirement benefit plans as well as expected contributions for 2021 for our funded pension benefit plans we made cash contributions totaling approximately 30 million to our defined benefit plans in 2020 and we estimate that we will make contributions totaling approximately 32 million to our defined benefit plans in 2021 due to the potential impact of future plan investment performance changes in interest rates changes in other economic and demographic assumptions and changes in legislation in foreign jurisdictions we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing and amount of contributions that may be required to fund our defined benefit plans for periods beyond 2021 

5 as of december 31 2020 our liability related to uncertain income tax positions was approximately 129 million 58 million of which has not been included in the above table as we are unable to predict when these liabilities will be paid due to the uncertainties in the timing of the settlement of the income tax positions 

application of critical accounting policies 

note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates and related disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes known actual results may differ from those estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

the majority of the company’s contracts within the research  development solutions segment are service contracts for clinical research that represent a single performance obligation the company provides a significant integration service resulting in a 

combined output which is clinical trial data that meets the relevant regulatory standards and can be used by the customer to progress to the next phase of a clinical trial or solicit approval of a treatment by the applicable regulatory body the performance obligation is satisfied over time as the output is captured in data and documentation that is available for the customer to consume over the course of the arrangement and furthers progress of the clinical trial the company recognizes revenue over time using a costbased input method since there is no single output measure that would fairly depict the transfer of control over the life of the performance obligation progress on the performance obligation is measured by the proportion of actual costs incurred to the total costs expected to complete the contract costs included in the measure of progress include direct labor and thirdparty costs such as payments to investigators and other pass through expenses for the company’s clinical monitors this costbased method of revenue recognition requires the company to make estimates of costs to complete its projects on an ongoing basis significant judgment is required to evaluate assumptions related to these estimates the effect of revisions to estimates related to the transaction price or costs to complete a project are recorded in the period in which the estimate is revised most contracts may be terminated upon 30 to 90 days notice by the customer however in the event of termination most contracts require payment for services rendered through the date of termination as well as for subsequent services rendered to close out the contract 

income taxes 

certain items of income and expense are not recognized on our income tax returns and financial statements in the same year which creates timing differences the income tax effect of these timing differences results in 1 deferred income tax assets that create a reduction in future income taxes and 2 deferred income tax liabilities that create an increase in future income taxes recognition of deferred income tax assets is based on management’s belief that it is more likely than not that the income tax benefit associated with certain temporary differences income tax operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and income tax credits would be realized we recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets for those deferred income tax items for which it was more likely than not that realization would not occur we determined the amount of the valuation allowance based in part on our assessment of future taxable income and in light of our ongoing income tax strategies if our estimate of future taxable income or tax strategies changes at any time in the future we would record an adjustment to our valuation allowance recording such an adjustment could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

income tax expense is based on the distribution of profit before income tax among the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate adjusted as required by the income tax laws of each taxing jurisdiction changes in the distribution of profits and losses among taxing jurisdictions may have a significant impact on our effective income tax rate we do not consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states 

business combinations 

we use the acquisition method to account for business combinations and accordingly the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recorded at their estimated fair values on the date of the acquisition we use significant judgments estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest including expected future cash flows discount rates that reflect the risk associated with the expected future cash flows and estimated useful lives 

we have recorded and allocated to our reporting units the excess of the cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired known as goodwill the recoverability of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated annually for impairment or if and when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment we review the carrying values of other identifiable intangible assets if the facts and circumstances indicate a possible impairment any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

stockbased compensation 

we measure compensation cost for stockbased payment awards stock options and stock appreciation rights granted to employees and nonemployee directors at fair value using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model and for performance awards using the monte carlo simulation model stockbased compensation expense includes stockbased awards granted to employees and nonemployee directors and has been reported in selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income based upon the classification of the individuals who were granted stockbased awards 

the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions including share price volatility the expected life of the award riskfree interest rate and the fair value of the underlying common shares on the date of grant in developing our assumptions we take into account the following 

• we calculate expected volatility based on reported data for selected reasonably similar publicly traded companies for which the historical information is available we plan to continue to use the guideline peer group volatility information until the historical volatility of our common shares is relevant to measure expected volatility for future award grants 

• we determine the riskfree interest rate by reference to implied yields available from united states treasury securities with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant 

• we estimate the dividend yield to be zero as we do not currently anticipate paying any future dividends 

• we estimate the average expected life of the award based on our historical experience and 

• we estimate forfeitures based on our historical analysis of actual forfeitures 

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

we provide retirement benefits to certain employees including defined benefit pension plans and postretirement medical plans the determination of benefit obligations and expense is based on actuarial models in order to measure benefit costs and obligations using these models critical assumptions are made with regard to the discount rate expected return on plan assets cash balance crediting rate lump sum conversion rate and the assumed rate of compensation increases in addition retiree medical care cost trend rates are a key assumption used exclusively in determining costs for our postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to various market risks and we regularly evaluate our exposure to such changes our overall risk management strategy seeks to balance the magnitude of the exposure and the cost and availability of appropriate financial instruments the following analyses present the sensitivity of our financial instruments to hypothetical changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period 

foreign currency exchange rates 

we transact business in more than 100 countries and approximately 60 currencies and are subject to risks associated with fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates our objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency exchange rate movements accordingly we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency cash flows related to service contracts and to hedge nonunited states dollar anticipated intercompany reseller fees it is our policy to enter into foreign currency transactions only to the extent necessary to meet our objectives as stated above we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for investment or speculative purposes the principal currencies hedged in 2020 were the british pound and the japanese yen 

the contractual value of our foreign exchange derivative instruments all of which were foreign exchange forward contracts was approximately 70 million at december 31 2020 the fair value of these contracts is subject to change as a result of potential changes in foreign exchange rates we assess our market risk based on changes in foreign exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential gain or loss in fair values based on a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates the potential gain in fair value for foreign exchange forward contracts based on a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the united states dollar was 7 million at december 31 2020 however the change in the fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts would likely be offset by a change in the value of the future service contract revenue or reseller fee being 

hedged caused by the currency exchange rate fluctuation the estimated fair values of the foreign exchange forward contracts were determined based on quoted market prices 

exchange rate fluctuations affect the united states dollar value of foreign currency revenue and expenses and may have a significant effect on our results excluding the impacts from any outstanding or future hedging transactions a hypothetical 10 change in average exchange rates used to translate all foreign currencies to the united states dollar would have impacted income before income taxes for 2020 by approximately 120 million the actual impact of exchange rate movements in the future could differ materially from this hypothetical analysis based on the mix of foreign currencies and the timing and magnitude of individual exchange rate movements 

additionally commencing in 2016 we designated a portion of our foreign currency denominated debt as a hedge of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries to reduce the volatility in stockholders’ equity caused by changes in the euro exchange rate with respect to the united states dollar as of december 31 2020 these borrowings net of original issue discount were €5323 million 6529 million a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the united states dollar would lead to a potential loss in fair value of 653 million however this change in fair value would be offset by the change in value of the hedged portion of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries caused by the currency exchange rate fluctuation 

interest rates 

because we have variable rate debt fluctuations in interest rates affect our business we attempt to minimize interest rate risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps we have entered into interest rate swaps with financial institutions that have reset dates and critical terms that match the underlying debt accordingly any change in market value associated with the interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 64 billion of variable rate indebtedness and interest rate swaps with a notional value of 22 billion because we do not attempt to hedge all of our variable rate debt we may incur higher interest costs for the portion of our variable rate debt that is not hedged excluding debt covered by hedges each quarterpoint increase or decrease in the interest rate on our variable rate debt would result in our interest expense changing by approximately 35 million per year 

marketable securities 

at december 31 2020 we held investments in marketable equity securities these investments are classified as either trading securities or availableforsale securities and are recorded at fair value these securities are subject to price risk as of december 31 2020 the fair value of these investments was 88 million based on the quoted market value of the securities the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease of 10 in quoted market values was approximately 9 million at december 31 2020

we combine our proprietary information assets with advanced analytics transformative technology and domain expertise to develop clinical and commercial capabilities that enable us to grow our relationships with healthcare stakeholders throughout the life science’s value chain this set of capabilities includes













 

our market opportunity 

we compete in a market of greater than 230 billion consisting of outsourced research and development realworld evidence and connected health and technology enabled clinical and commercial operations markets for life sciences companies and the broader healthcare industry the following sets forth our estimates for the size of our principal markets 







in deriving estimates of the size of the various markets described above we review thirdparty sources which include estimates and forecasts of spending in various segments in combination with internal iqvia research and analysis informed by our experience serving these segments as well as projected growth rates for each of these segments see “industry and market data” above   

we believe there are six key trends affecting our end markets that will create increasing demand for research and development services technology  analytics solutions and contract and medical solutions  

growth and innovation in the life sciences industry the life sciences industry is a large and critical part of the global healthcare system and according to the latest information available from the iqvia market prognosis service is estimated to have generated approximately 125 trillion in revenue in 2019 according to our research revenue growth in the life sciences industry globally is expected to range from 3 to 6 between 2020 and 2024 according to the iqvia institute it is estimated that spending on pharmaceuticals in emerging markets will expand at a 5 to 8 compound annual growth rate “cagr” through 2024 the growth of emerging markets is making these geographies strategically important to life sciences organizations and consistent with their approach in the developed markets we expect these organizations to apply a high degree of sophistication to their commercial operations in these countries for global companies this requires highly localized knowledge and information assets the development of market access strategies and performance benchmarking in addition local players are learning that they need to compete on the basis of improved information and analytics 

growth in research and development spending trends in research and development are impacted as a result of several factors including major biopharmaceutical companies’ efforts to replenish revenues lost from the socalled “patent cliff” increased access to capital by the small and midcap biotechnology industry and recent increases in pharmaceutical approvals by regulatory authorities the iqvia institute also estimates that approximately 270 new molecular entities “nmes” are expected to be approved between 2020 and 2024 compared to 236 between 2015 and 2019 and 200 between 2010 and 2014 we believe that further research and development spending combined with the continued need for cost efficiency across the healthcare landscape will continue to create opportunities for biopharmaceutical services companies particularly those with a global reach and broad service offerings to help biopharmaceutical companies with their pre and postlaunch solutions development and commercialization needs 

 

increased complexity in research and development biopharmaceutical companies face environments in which it has become increasingly difficult to operate improved standards of care in many therapeutic areas and the emergence of new types of therapies such as biologics genetically targeted therapies gene and stem cell therapies and other treatment modalities have led to more complex development and regulatory pathways we believe that our global clinical development capabilities including our expertise in biomarkers and genomics and our global laboratory network position us well to help biopharmaceutical companies manage the complexities inherent in an environment where this t ype of expertise is important for example the iqvia core helps us validate protocols to ensure studies in new disease areas have greater accuracy and also enables us through innovations such as predictive analytics  to find patients who may not have been diagnosed 

regulators require clinical trials involving local populations as part of the process for approving new pharmaceutical products especially in certain asian and emerging markets understanding the epidemiological and physiological differences in different ethnic populations and being able to conduct clinical trials locally in certain geographies will be important to pharmaceutical product growth strategies both for multinational and localregional biopharmaceutical companies we believe that our global clinical development capabilities and unmatched presence in asia and other emerging markets make us a strong partner for biopharmaceutical companies managing the complexities of international drug development 

financial pressures driving the need for increased efficiency despite expected accelerating growth in the global life sciences market we believe our clients will face increased operating margin pressure due to their changing product mix pricing and reimbursement challenges and rising costs of compliance product portfolios for life sciences companies have shifted toward specialty products with lower peak market sales potential than traditional primary care medicines we believe that the need for biopharmaceutical companies to maximize productivity and lower costs across their processes from research and development through commercial operations will cause them to look to partners as they enter into outsourcing arrangements to improve efficiency further our clients are looking for new ways to simplify processes and drive operational efficiencies by using automation consolidating vendors and adopting new technology options such as hosted and cloudbased applications this provides opportunities for technology services vendors to capture and consolidate internal spending by providing lowercost and variablecost options that lower clients’ research and development selling marketing and administrative costs 

evolving need to integrate and structure expanding sources of data over the past decade many health systems around the world have focused on digitizing medical records while such records theoretically enhance access to data relevant information is often unintegrated unstructured siloed in disparate software systems or entered inconsistently in addition new sources of data from the internet such as social media and information on limited patient pools and information resulting from enhanced diagnostic technologies are creating new sources of healthcare data 

in order to derive valuable insights from existing and expanding sources of information clients need access to statistically significant data sets organized into databases that can be queried and analyzed for example realworld evidence studies demonstrate practical and clinical efficacies which we believe require the aggregation and integration of large clinical data sets across all care settings types of therapies and patient cohorts longitudinal studies require analysis of nonidentified patient diagnoses treatments procedures and laboratory test results to identify types of patients that will likely best respond to particular therapies finally manufacturers also require the ability to analyze social media activity to identify unmet patient needs and support for new orphan drugs this information is highly relevant to all healthcare stakeholders and we believe the opportunity to more broadly apply healthcare data can only be realized through structuring organizing and integrating new and existing forms of data in conjunction with sophisticated analytics 

need for demonstrated value in healthcare participants in the healthcare industry are focused on improving quality and reducing costs both of which require assessment of quality and value of therapies and providers as a result physicians no longer make prescribing decisions in isolation but rather in the context of guidance and rules from payers integrated delivery networks and governments we believe life sciences companies are working to bring alignment across constituents on the value of their treatments in order to successfully develop and commercialize new therapies 

there is increasing pressure on life sciences companies to support and justify the value of their therapies many new drugs that are being approved are more expensive than existing therapies and will likely receive heightened scrutiny by regulators and payers to determine whether the existing treatment options would be sufficient additionally many new specialty drugs are molecularbased therapies and require a more detailed understanding of clinical factors and influencers that demonstrate therapeutic value as a result leading life sciences companies are utilizing more sophisticated outcome research and data analytics services 

 

we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of these global trends in healthcare beyond our proprietary information assets we have developed key capabilities to assess opportunities to develop and commercialize therapies support and defend the value of medicines and help our clients operate more efficiently through the application of insightdriven decisionmaking and costefficient technology solutions 

our growth strategy 

we believe we are well positioned for continued growth across the markets we serve our strategy for achieving growth includes 

continue to innovate by leveraging our information advanced analytics transformative technology and significant domain expertise as a leader in the development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical therapies we can empower our therapeutic scientific and domain experts with expansive levels of information including product level tracking in 90 markets and information about treatments and outcomes on more than 800 million nonidentified patients by integrating these capabilities in the iqvia core we have the ability to optimize the clinical trial process and enable our clients to reduce costs and get their products to market more quickly through more informed site selection faster patient recruitment practices and virtual trials we transform real world evidence by linking prospective and retrospective approaches and introduce innovation such as secondary control arms which eliminate the need for a placebo group we bring best in class saas platforms purpose built for life sciences to our clients to help them run their clinical and commercial operations more efficiently

expand portfolio through strategic acquisitions we have and expect to continue to acquire assets and businesses that strengthen our value proposition to clients we have developed an internal capability to source evaluate and integrate acquisitions that have created value for stockholders as the global healthcare landscape evolves we expect that there will be a growing number of acquisition opportunities across the life sciences payer and provider sectors we expect to continue to invest in or explore opportunities for strategic acquisitions to grow our platform and enhance our ability to provide more services to our clients 

expand the penetration of our offerings to the broader healthcare marketplace we believe that substantial opportunities exist to use our existing technology and domain expertise to serve additional healthcare stakeholders payers providers healthcare professionals to quantify and optimize cost of care delivery provide registry technology to professional association and patient communities and support healthcare providers with system implementation and platform migration

our technology  analytics solutions business competes with a broad and diverse set of businesses while we believe no competitor provides the combination of geographical reach and breadth of its services we generally compete in the countries in which we operate with other information analytics technology services and consulting companies as well as with the inhouse capabilities of our clients also we compete with certain government agencies private payers and other healthcare stakeholders that provide their data directly to others in addition to countrybycountry competition we have a number of regional and global competitors in the marketplace as well our offerings compete with various firms including accenture aetion boston health economics cognizant technology solutions covance inc deloitte evidera now part of ppd gfk lexisnexis risk solutions ibm infosys kantar health mckinsey nielsen optuminsight parexel international corporation press ganey rti health solutions pra health sciences tempus veeva and zs associates we also compete with a broad range of new entrants and startups that are looking to bring new technologies and business models to healthcare information services and technology services 

the markets for research  development solutions offerings are highly competitive and we compete against traditional contract research organizations “cros” the inhouse research and development departments of biopharmaceutical companies universities and teaching hospitals among the traditional cros there are severalhundred small limitedservice providers several mediumsized firms and only a few fullservice companies with global capabilities our primary competitors include covance inc icon plc parexel international corporation pharmaceutical product development inc pra health sciences and syneos health among others 

our contract sales  medical solutions business competes against the inhouse sales and marketing departments of biopharmaceutical companies other contract pharmaceutical sales and service organizations and consulting firms contract sales  medical solutions ’ primary competitor in the united states is syneos health publicis and united drug plc outside of the united states contract sales  medical solutions typically competes against single country or more regionally focused service providers such as united drug plc syneos health eps corporation and cmic holdings co ltd 

government regulation 

many aspects of our businesses are regulated by federal and state laws rules and regulations accordingly we maintain a robust compliance program aimed at ensuring we operate our business in compliance with all existing legal requirements material to the operation of our businesses there are however occasionally uncertainties involving the application of various legal requirements the violation of which could result in among other things fines or other sanctions see part i item 1a risk factors” for additional detail 

good clinical practice 

good clinical practice “gcp” regulations and guidelines are the industry standard for the conduct of clinical trials with respect to maintaining the integrity of the data and safety of the research subjects the united states food and drug administration “fda” the european medicines agency “ema” japan’s ministry of health labour and welfare and most other global 

 

regulatory authorities expect that study results and data submitted to such authorities be based on clinical trials conducted in accordance with gcp provisions records for clinical trials must be maintained for specified periods for inspection by the fda and other regulators 

regulation of drugs biologics and medical devices 

in the united states pharmaceutical biological and medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by the fda the federal food drug and cosmetic act “fdc act” the public health service act “phs act” and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern among other things the research development testing manufacture storage recordkeeping approval labeling promotion and marketing distribution postapproval monitoring and reporting sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical biological and medical device products failure to comply with applicable united states requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions such as fda refusal to approve a pending new drug application “nda” for a new drug a biologics license application “bla” for a new biological product premarket approval “pma” or clearance for a new medical device warning or untitled letters clinical holds product recalls product seizures total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions fines civil penalties and criminal prosecution 

regulation of patient information 

our information management services relate to the processing of information regarding patient diagnosis and treatment of disease and are therefore subject to substantial governmental regulation in addition the confidentiality of patientspecific information and the circumstances under which such patientspecific records may be released for inclusion in our databases or used in other aspects of our business is heavily regulated federal state and foreign governments are contemplating or have proposed or adopted additional legislation governing the possession use and dissemination of personal data such as personal health information and personal financial data as well as security breach notification rules for loss or theft of such data additional legislation or regulation of this type might among other things require us to implement additional security measures and processes or bring within the legislation or regulation deidentified health or other data each of which may require substantial expenditures or limit our ability to offer some of our services 

in particular personal health information is recognized in many countries such as the united states the european union or eu and several countries in asia as a special sensitive category of personal information subject to additional mandatory protections violations of data protection regulations are subject to administrative penalties civil money penalties and criminal prosecution including corporate fines and personal liability 

regulation of promotion marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products and medical devices 

certain of our services are subject to detailed and comprehensive regulation in each geographic market in which we operate such regulation relates among other things to the distribution of drug samples the marketing and promotion of approved products the qualifications of sales representatives and the use of healthcare professionals in sales functions 

in the united states certain of our services are subject to numerous federal and state laws pertaining to promotional activities involving pharmaceutical products and medical devices certain of our services are subject to the fda’s regulations against “offlabel promotion” which require sales representatives to restrict promotion of the approved product they are detailing to the approved labeling for the product the prescription drug marketing act imposes licensing personnel record keeping packaging labeling product handling and facility storage and security requirements other federal and state laws prohibit manufacturers suppliers and providers from offering giving or receiving kickbacks or other remuneration in connection with ordering or recommending the purchase or rental of healthcare items and services the sale or distribution of pharmaceutical products and devices is also governed by the united states federal trade commission act and state consumer protection laws we are subject to similar regulations currently in effect in the other countries where we offer contract sales  medical solutions  

we are also subject to various laws and regulations that may apply to certain drug and device promotional practices including among others various aspects of medicare and federal healthcare programs violations of these laws and regulations may result in criminal andor civil penalties including possibly as an “aider and abettor”   

regulation of laboratories 

our united states laboratories are subject to licensing and regulation under federal state and local laws relating to hazard communication and employee righttoknow regulations and the safety and health of laboratory employees additionally our united states laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations and licensing requirements relating to the handling storage and disposal of hazardous waste radioactive materials and laboratory specimens including the regulations of the 

 

environmental protection agency the nuclear regulatory commission the department of transportation the national fire protection agency and the united states drug enforcement administration “dea” the use of controlled substances in testing for drugs with a potential for abuse is regulated in the united states by the dea and by similar regulatory bodies in other parts of the world our united states laboratories using controlled substances for testing purposes are licensed by the dea the regulations of the united states department of transportation public health service and postal service apply to the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens our laboratories also are subject to international air transport association regulations which govern international shipments of laboratory specimens furthermore when the materials are sent to a foreign country the transportation of such materials becomes subject to the laws rules and regulations of such foreign country our laboratories outside the united states are subject to applicable national laws governing matters such as licensing the handling and disposal of medical specimens genetic material hazardous waste and radioactive materials as well as the health and safety of laboratory employees 

in addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace the united states occupational safety and health administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers may be exposed to bloodborne pathogens such as hiv and the hepatitis b virus although we believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with such federal state and local laws failure to comply with such laws could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business fines criminal penalties and other enforcement actions 

further laboratories that analyze human blood or other biological samples for the diagnosis and treatment of clinical trial subjects must comply with clinical laboratory improvement amendments “clia” as well as requirements established by various states the failure to meet these requirements may result in civil penalties and suspension or revocation of the clia certification 

our intellectual property 

in addition to our proprietary data sets described above we develop and use a number of proprietary methodologies analytics systems technologies and other intellectual property in the conduct of our business we rely upon a combination of legal technical and administrative safeguards to protect our proprietary and confidential information and trade secrets and patent copyright and trademark laws to protect other intellectual property rights we consider our trademark and related names marks and logos to be of material importance to our business and we have registered or applied for registration for certain of these trademarks including iqvia in the united states and other jurisdictions and aggressively seek to protect them trademarks and service marks generally may be renewed indefinitely so long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained and so long as they have not been found to have become generic the technology and other intellectual property rights owned and licensed by us are of importance to our business although our management believes that our business as a whole is not dependent upon any one intellectual property or group of such properties

 item 1a risk factors 

risk factors

we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks some of which are beyond our control you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below together with the other information included in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating our company the occurrence of any of the following risks may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects 

risks relating to our business 

the potential loss or delay of our large contracts or of multiple contracts could adversely affect our results 

most of our research  development solutions clients can terminate our contracts upon 30 to 90 days notice our clients may delay terminate or reduce the scope of our contracts for a variety of reasons beyond our control including but not limited to 























as a result contract terminations delays and alterations are a regular part of our research  development solutions business in the event of termination our contracts often provide for fees for winding down the project but these fees may not be sufficient for us to realize the full amount of revenues or profits anticipated under the related services contracts and termination may result in lower resource utilization rates in addition we will not realize the full benefits of our backlog of contractually committed services if our clients cancel delay or reduce their commitments under our contracts with them which may occur if among other things a client decides to shift its business to a competitor or revoke our status as a preferred provider thus the loss or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could adversely affect our revenues and profitability we believe the risk of loss or delay of multiple contracts potentially has greater effect where we are party to broader partnering arrangements with global biopharmaceutical companies 

 

  we depend on third parties for data and support services our suppliers or providers might restrict our use of or refuse to license data or provide services which could lead to our inability to access certain data or provide certain services and as a result materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

each of our technology  analytics solutions information services is derived from data we collect from third parties these data suppliers are numerous and diverse reflecting the broad scope of information that we collect and use in our business 

although we typically enter into longterm contractual arrangements with many of these suppliers of data at the time of entry into a new contract or renewal of an existing contract suppliers may increase restrictions on our use of such data increase the price they charge us for data or refuse altogether to license the data to us in addition during the term of any data supply contract suppliers may fail to adhere to our data quality control standards or fail to deliver data further although no single individual data supplier is material to our business if a number of suppliers collectively representing a significant amount of data that we use for one or more of our services were to impose additional contractual restrictions on our use of or access to data fail to adhere to our qualitycontrol standards repeatedly fail to deliver data or refuse to provide data now or in the future our ability to provide those services to our clients could be materially adversely impacted which may harm our operating results and financial condition 

additionally we depend on third parties for support services to our business such support services include but are not limited to thirdparty transportation providers suppliers of drugs for patients participating in clinical trials suppliers of kits for use in our clinical trial laboratories business suppliers of reagents for use in our testing equipment and providers of maintenance contracts for our equipment the failure of any of these third parties to adequately provide the critical support services could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if we fail to perform our services in accordance with contractual requirements regulatory standards and ethical considerations we could be subject to significant costs or liability and our reputation could be harmed 

we contract with biopharmaceutical companies to perform a wide range of services to assist them in bringing new drugs to market our services include monitoring clinical trials data and laboratory analysis electronic data capture patient recruitment and other related services and we perform these services in a number of ways including through physical and technologyenabled efforts such services are complex and subject to contractual requirements regulatory standards and ethical considerations for example we must adhere to regulatory requirements such as the fda and current gcp and good laboratory practice requirements if we fail to perform our services in accordance with these requirements regulatory agencies may take action against us for failure to comply with applicable regulations governing clinical trials or sales and marketing practices such actions may include sanctions such as injunctions or failure of such regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of products delay suspension or withdrawal of approvals license revocation product seizures or recalls operational restrictions civil or criminal penalties or prosecutions damages or fines clients may also bring claims against us for breach of our contractual obligations and patients in the clinical trials and patients taking drugs approved on the basis of those clinical trials may bring personal injury claims against us for negligence any such action could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and reputation 

such consequences could arise if among other things the following occur 

improper performance of our services the performance of clinical development services is complex and timeconsuming for example we may make mistakes in conducting a clinical trial that could negatively impact or obviate the usefulness of the clinical trial or cause the results of the clinical trial to be reported improperly if the clinical trial results are compromised we could be subject to significant costs or liability which could have an adverse impact on our ability to perform our services as examples 







large clinical trials can cost up to hundreds of millions of dollars and while we endeavor to contractually limit our exposure to such risks improper performance of our services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition damage our reputation and result in the cancellation of current contracts by or failure to obtain future contracts from the affected client or other clients 

 

investigation of clients from time to time one or more of our clients are audited or investigated by regulatory authorities or enforcement agencies with respect to regulatory compliance of their clinical trials programs or the marketing and sale of their drugs in these situations we have often provided services to our clients with respect to the clinical trials programs or activities being audited or investigated and we are called upon to respond to requests for information by the authorities and agencies there is a risk that either our clients or regulatory authorities could claim that we performed our services improperly or that we are responsible for clinical trial or program compliance if our clients or regulatory authorities make such claims against us and prove them we could be subject to damages fines or penalties in addition negative publicity regarding regulatory compliance of our clients’ clinical trials programs or drugs could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

insufficient client funding to complete a clinical trial as noted above clinical trials can cost hundreds of millions of dollars there is a risk that we may initiate a clinical trial for a client and then the client becomes unwilling or unable to fund the completion of the clinical trial in such a situation notwithstanding the client’s ability or willingness to pay for or otherwise facilitate the completion of the clinical trial we may be ethically bound to complete or wind down the clinical trial at our own expense 

security breaches and unauthorized use of our it systems and information or the it systems or information in the possession of our vendors could expose us our clients our data suppliers or others to risk of loss 

we rely upon the security of our computer and communications systems infrastructure to protect us from cyberattacks and unauthorized access cyberattacks can include malware computer viruses hacking or other significant disruption of our computer communications and related systems cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems as cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against one or more cyber threats might defeat the measures that we or our vendors take to anticipate detect avoid or mitigate such threats certain techniques used to obtain unauthorized access introduce malicious software disable or degrade service or sabotage systems may be designed to remain dormant until a triggering event and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures since techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources although we take steps to manage and avoid these risks and to prevent their recurrence our preventive and remedial actions may not be successful such attacks whether successful or unsuccessful could result in our incurring costs related to for example rebuilding internal systems defending against litigation responding to regulatory inquiries or actions paying damages or fines or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties publicity about vulnerabilities and attempted or successful incursions could damage our reputation with clients and data suppliers and reduce demand for our services 

we also store proprietary and sensitive information in connection with our business which could be compromised by a cyberattack to the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data an inappropriate disclosure of proprietary or sensitive information an inability to access data sources or an inability to process data or provide our offerings to our clients it could cause significant damage to our reputation affect our relationships with our data suppliers and clients including loss of suppliers and clients lead to claims against us and ultimately harm our business we may be required to incur significant costs to alleviate remedy or protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future we may also face inquiry or increased scrutiny from government agencies as a result of any such disruption or breach while we have insurance coverage for certain instances of a cyber security breach our coverage may not be sufficient if we suffer a significant attack or multiple attacks any such breach or disruption could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and our reputation as a provider of missioncritical services 

some of our vendors have significant responsibility for the security of certain of our data centers and computerbased platforms also our data suppliers have responsibility for security of their own computer and communications environments these third parties face risks relating to cyber security similar to ours which could disrupt their businesses and therefore materially impact ours accordingly we are subject to any flaw in or breaches to their computer and communications systems or those that they operate for us which could result in a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial results 

failure to meet productivity objectives under our internal business transformation initiatives could adversely impact our competitiveness and harm our operating results 

we are pursuing business transformation initiatives to update technology increase innovation and obtain operating efficiencies as part of these initiatives we seek to improve our productivity flexibility quality functionality and cost savings by investing in the development and implementation of global platforms and integration of our business processes and functions to achieve economies of scale for example we have assessed our site activation processes and are moving forward with implementing organizational and process changes and technology transformations to accelerate site startup timelines  we are also evaluating the customer buying experience implementing technology platforms to streamline the proposal and contracting process and provide greater transparency to clients these various initiatives may not yield their intended gains or be completed in timely manner which 

 

may impact our competitiveness and our ability to meet our growth objectives and as a result materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

if we are unsuccessful at investing in growth opportunities our business could be materially and adversely affected 

we continue to invest significantly in growth opportunities including the development and acquisition of new data technologies and services to meet our clients’ needs for example we are expanding our services and technology offerings such as the development of a cloudbased platform with a growing number of applications to support commercial operations for life sciences companies eg multichannel marketing marketing campaign management customer relationship management incentive compensation management targeting and segmentation performance management and other applications we also continue to invest significantly in growth opportunities in emerging markets such as the development launch and enhancement of services in china india russia turkey and other countries we consider our presence in these markets to be an important component of our growth strategy 

there is no assurance that our investment plans or growth strategy will be successful or will produce a sufficient or any return on our investments further if we are unable to develop new technologies and services clients do not purchase our new technologies and services our new technologies and services do not work as intended or there are delays in the availability or adoption of our new technologies and services then we may not be able to grow our business or growth may occur slower than anticipated additionally although we expect continued growth in healthcare spending in emerging markets such spending may occur more slowly or not at all and we may not benefit from our investments in these markets

we plan to fund growth opportunities with cash from operations or from future financings there can be no assurance that those sources will be available in sufficient amounts to fund future growth opportunities when needed 

any of the foregoing could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

data protection privacy and similar laws in the united states and around the world restrict access use and disclosure of personal information and failure to comply with or adapt to changes in these laws could materially and adversely harm our business 

the confidentiality collection use and disclosure of personal data including individually identifiable health information and clinical trial patientspecific information are subject to governmental regulation generally in the country that the personal data were collected or used for example united states federal regulations under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” create specific requirements for the protection of the privacy and security of individual health information these provisions apply to both “covered entities” primarily health care providers and health insurers and their “business associates” or service providers as there are some instances where we are a hipaa “business associate” of a “covered entity” we can be directly liable for mishandling protected health information under hipaa’s enforcement scheme we can be subject to significant penalties in connection with hipaa violations along with the potential for significant other expenditures related to these activities these rules require individuals’ written authorization in many situations in addition to any required informed consent before protected health information may be used for research we are both directly and indirectly affected by the privacy provisions surrounding individual authorizations because many investigators with whom we are involved in clinical trials are directly subject to them as a hipaa “covered entity” and because we obtain identifiable health information from third parties that are subject to such regulations in general patient health information is among the most sensitive and highly regulated of personal information and laws and regulations around the united states and the world are designed to ensure that information about an individual’s healthcare is properly protected from inappropriate access use and disclosure laws restricting access use and disclosure of patient health information also include the european union’s “eu” general data protection regulation canada’s personal information protection and electronic documents act and other data protection privacy data security and similar national stateprovincial and local laws in the eu personal data includes any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person with health information carrying additional obligations including obtaining the explicit consent from the individual for collection use or disclosure of the information in addition we are subject to eu rules with respect to crossborder transfers of such data out of the eu along with similar data transfer requirements or data localization requirements in other countries the united states the eu and its member states and other countries where we have operations such as argentina brazil canada chile china japan malaysia mexico philippines russia singapore south korea and switzerland continue to consider or have issued new privacy and data protection rules and regulations that relate to personal data and health information 

 

we have established frameworks models processes and technologies to manage privacy and security for many data types from a variety of sources and under myriad privacy and data protection laws worldwide in addition we rely on our data suppliers to deliver information to us in a form and in a manner that complies with applicable privacy and data protection laws these laws are complex and there is no assurance that the safeguards and controls employed by us or our data suppliers will be sufficient to prevent a breach of these laws or that claims will not be filed against us or our data suppliers despite such safeguards and controls failure to comply with such laws certain certificationregistration and annual recertificationregistration provisions associated with these data protection and privacy regulations and similar rules in various jurisdictions or to resolve any serious privacy complaints may result in among other things regulatory sanctions criminal prosecution civil liability negative publicity damage to our reputation or data being blocked from use or liability under contractual provisions for example in july 2015 indictments were issued by the seoul central district prosecutors’ office in south korea against ims korea and two of its employees among others alleging improper handling of sensitive health information in violation of applicable privacy laws see item 3 “legal proceedings” for additional information 

laws and expectations relating to privacy continue to evolve and we continue to adapt to changing needs for example the definition of “personally identifiable information” and “personal data” continues to evolve and broaden and many new laws and regulations are being enacted in addition certain longestablished programs have been or are at risk of being declared invalid such as the euus safe harbor framework that operated for many years but was struck down by european courts in 2015 so that this area remains in a state of flux changes to these programs may adversely impact our ability to provide services to our clients or develop new products or services federal state and foreign governments are contemplating or have proposed or adopted additional legislation governing the collection possession use or dissemination of personal data such as personal health information and personal financial data as well as security breach notification rules for loss or theft of such data additional legislation or regulation of this type might among other things require us to implement new security measures and processes or bring within the legislation other personal data not currently regulated each of which may require substantial expenditures or limit our ability to offer some of our services additionally changes in these laws including newly released interpretations of these laws by courts and regulatory bodies may limit our data access use and disclosure and may require increased expenditures by us or may dictate that we not offer certain types of services any of the foregoing may have a material adverse impact on our ability to provide services to our clients or maintain our profitability

there is ongoing concern from privacy advocates regulators and others regarding data protection and privacy issues and the number of jurisdictions with data protection and privacy laws has been increasing also there are ongoing public policy discussions regarding whether the standards for deidentified anonymous or pseudonymized health information are sufficient and the risk of reidentification sufficiently small to adequately protect patient privacy these discussions may lead to further restrictions on the use of such information there can be no assurance that these initiatives or future initiatives will not adversely affect our ability to access and use data or to develop or market current or future services 

data protection privacy and similar laws protect more than patient information and although they vary by jurisdiction these laws can extend to employee information business contact information provider information and other information relating to identifiable individuals failure to comply with these laws may result in among other things civil and criminal liability negative publicity damage to our reputation and liability under contractual provisions in addition compliance with such laws may require increased costs to us or may dictate that we not offer certain types of services 

the occurrence of any of the foregoing could impact our ability to provide the same level of service to our clients require us to modify our offerings or increase our costs which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition

our success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 

our success depends in part upon our ability to develop use and protect our proprietary methodologies analytics systems technologies and other intellectual property we rely upon a combination of trade secrets confidentiality policies nondisclosure invention assignment and other contractual arrangements and patent copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights these laws are subject to change at any time and certain agreements may not be fully enforceable which could further restrict our ability to protect our innovations further these laws may not provide adequate protection for our intellectual property particularly in countries in which the legal system provides less protection for intellectual property rights our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing services similar to or duplicative of ours further the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors former employees or other third parties and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 

 

our ability to obtain protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation or thirdparty opposition risks as well as the uncertainty as to the scope of protection registrability patentability validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights in each applicable country governments may adopt regulations and government agencies or courts may render decisions requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property rights when we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights  we may be subject to claims that the intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our confidential and proprietary information litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly time consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property rights furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management’s attention and resources could delay further sales or the implementation of our solutions impair the functionality of our solutions delay introductions of new solutions result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our solutions or injure our reputation and harm our operating results and financial condition 

the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could reduce the differentiation of our services and harm our business the value of our investment in development or business acquisitions could be reduced and third parties might make claims against us related to losses of their confidential or proprietary information in addition we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights these incidents and claims could harm our business reduce revenue increase expenses and harm our reputation 

we may be subject to claims by others that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights 

third parties may assert claims that we or our clients infringe their intellectual property rights and these claims with or without merit could be expensive to litigate cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management resources and attention in defending the claim in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can also seek injunctive relief that may limit the operation of our business or prevent the marketing and selling of our services that infringe on the plaintiff’s intellectual property rights to resolve these claims we may enter into licensing agreements with restrictive terms or significant fees stop selling be required to implement costly redesigns to the affected services or pay damages to satisfy contractual obligations to others if we do not resolve these claims in advance of a trial there is no guarantee that we will be successful in court these outcomes may have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition certain contracts with our suppliers or clients contain provisions whereby we indemnify subject to certain limitations the counterparty for damages suffered as a result of claims related to intellectual property infringement and the use of data claims made under these provisions could be expensive to litigate and could result in significant payments 

  we rely on licenses from third parties to certain technology and intellectual property rights for some of our services and the licenses we currently have could terminate or expire 

some of our business services rely on technology or intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others our licenses to this technology or these intellectual property rights could be terminated or could expire we may be unable to replace these licenses in a timely manner failure to renew these licenses or renewals of these licenses on less advantageous terms could harm our operating results and financial condition 

our financial results may be adversely affected if we underprice our contracts overrun our cost estimates or fail to receive approval for or experience delays in documenting change orders 

most of our research  development solutions contracts are either fee for service contracts or fixedfee contracts our past financial results have been and our future financial results may be adversely impacted if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates and are unable to successfully negotiate a change order change orders typically occur when the scope of work we perform needs to be modified from that originally contemplated by our contract with the client modifications can occur for example when there is a change in a key clinical trial assumption or parameter or a significant change in timing where we are not successful in converting outofscope work into change orders under our current contracts we bear the cost of the additional work such underpricing significant cost overruns or delay in documentation of change orders could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

 

the relationship of backlog to revenues varies over time 

backlog represents future revenues for our research  development solutions business from work not yet completed or performed under signed binding commitments and signed contracts once work begins on a project revenue is recognized over the duration of the project projects may be terminated or delayed by the client or delayed by regulatory authorities for reasons beyond our control to the extent projects are delayed the timing of our revenue could be affected in the event that a client cancels a contract we typically would be entitled to receive payment for all services performed up to the cancellation date and subsequent clientauthorized services related to terminating the canceled project typically however we have no contractual right to the full amount of the revenue reflected in our backlog in the event of a contract cancellation the duration of the projects included in our backlog and the related revenue recognition range from a few weeks to many years our backlog may not be indicative of our future revenues from our research  development solutions business and we may not realize all the anticipated future revenue reflected in our backlog a number of factors may affect backlog including 









although an increase in backlog will generally result in an increase in revenues to be recognized over time depending on the level of cancellations an increase in backlog at a particular point in time does not necessarily correspond directly to an increase in revenues during a particular period the extent to which contracts in backlog will result in revenue depends on many factors including but not limited to delivery against projected schedules the need for scope changes change orders contract cancellations and the nature duration size complexity and phase of the contracts each of which factors can vary significantly from time to time 

the rate at which our backlog converts to revenue may vary over time for a variety of reasons the revenue recognition on larger more global projects could be slower than on smaller less global projects for a variety of reasons including but not limited to an extended period of negotiation between the time the project is awarded to us and the actual execution of the contract as well as an increased timeframe for obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals additionally the increased complexity of clinical trials and the need to enroll precise patient populations could extend the length of clinical trials causing revenue to be recognized over a longer period of time further delayed projects will remain in backlog unless otherwise canceled by the client and will not generate revenue at the rate originally expected thus the relationship of backlog to realized revenues may vary over time

our business depends on the continued effectiveness and availability of our information systems including the information systems we use to provide our services to our clients and failures of these systems may materially limit our operations 

due to the global nature of our business and our reliance on information systems to provide our services we intend to increase our use of webenabled and other integrated information systems in delivering our services we also provide access to similar information systems to certain of our clients in connection with the services we provide them as the breadth and complexity of our information systems continue to grow we will increasingly be exposed to the risks inherent in the development integration and ongoing operation of evolving information systems including 







 

the materialization of any of these risks may impede the processing of data the delivery of databases and services and the daytoday management of our business and could result in the corruption loss or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary confidential or other data while we have disaster recovery plans in place they might not adequately protect us in the event of a system failure while many of our operations have disaster recovery plans in place we currently do not have excess or standby computer processing or network capacity everywhere in the world to avoid disruption in the receipt processing and delivery of data in the event of a system failure despite any precautions we take damage from fire floods hurricanes power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses breakins and similar events at our various computer facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to our servers and from our servers to our clients corruption or loss of data may result in the need to repeat a clinical trial at no cost to the client but at significant cost to us the termination of a contract or damage to our reputation 

in addition any failure by our computer environment to provide sufficient processing or network capacity to transfer data could result in interruptions in our service in the event of a delay in the delivery of data we could be required to transfer our data collection operations to an alternative provider of server hosting services such a transfer could result in significant delays in our ability to deliver services to our clients and increase our costs additionally significant delays in system enhancements or inadequate performance of new or upgraded systems once completed could damage our reputation and harm our business finally longterm disruptions in the infrastructure caused by events such as natural disasters the outbreak of war the escalation of hostilities and acts of terrorism particularly involving cities in which we have offices could adversely affect our businesses although we carry property and business interruption insurance our coverage might not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur 

we have continued to undertake significant programs to optimize business processes with respect to our services our inability to effectively manage the implementation and adapt to new processes designed into new or upgraded systems in a timely and costeffective manner may result in disruption to our business and negatively affect our operations 

we have entered into agreements with certain vendors to provide systems development and integration services that develop or license to us the it platform for programs to optimize our business processes if such vendors fail to perform as required or if there are substantial delays in developing implementing and updating the it platform our client delivery may be impaired and we may have to make substantial further investments internally or with third parties to achieve our objectives additionally our progress may be limited by parties with existing or claimed patents who seek to enjoin us from using preferred technology or seek license payments from us meeting our objectives is dependent on a number of factors which may not take place as we anticipate including obtaining adequate technologyenabled services creating itenabled services that our clients will find desirable and implementing our business model with respect to these services also increased itrelated expenditures may negatively impact our profitability 

we may experience challenges with the acquisition development enhancement or deployment of technology necessary for our business 

we operate in businesses that require sophisticated computer systems and software for data collection data processing cloudbased platforms analytics cryptography statistical projections and forecasting mobile computing social media analytics and other applications and technologies particularly in our technology  analytics solutions and research  development solutions businesses we seek to address our technology risks by increasing our reliance on the use of innovations by crossindustry technology leaders and adapt these for our biopharmaceutical and healthcare industry clients some of these technologies supporting the industries we serve are changing rapidly and we must continue to adapt to these changes in a timely and effective manner at an acceptable cost we also must continue to deliver data to our clients in forms that are easy to use while simultaneously providing clear answers to complex questions there can be no guarantee that we will be able to develop acquire or integrate new technologies that these new technologies will meet our needs or those of our clients’ needs or achieve expected investment goals or that we will be able to do so as quickly or costeffectively as our competitors significant technological change could render certain of our services obsolete moreover the introduction of new services embodying new technologies could render certain of our existing services obsolete our continued success will depend on our ability to adapt to changing technologies manage and process everincreasing amounts of data and information and improve the performance features and reliability of our services in response to changing client and industry demands we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful design development testing introduction or marketing of our services new services or enhancements to existing services may not adequately meet our own requirements or those of current and prospective clients or achieve any degree of significant market acceptance these types of failures could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and reputation 

 

consolidation in the industries in which our clients operate may reduce the volume of services purchased by consolidated clients following an acquisition or merger which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 

mergers or consolidations among our clients have in the past and could in the future reduce the number of our clients and potential clients when companies consolidate overlapping services previously purchased separately are usually purchased only once by the combined entity leading to loss of revenue other services that were previously purchased by one of the merged or consolidated entities may be deemed unnecessary or cancelled if our clients merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services there can be no assurance as to the degree to which we may be able to address the revenue impact of such consolidation any of these developments could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by client or therapeutic concentration 

although we did not have any client that represented 10 or more of our revenues in 2019 2018 and 2017 we derive the majority of our revenues from a number of large clients if any large client decreases or terminates its relationship with us our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

additionally conducting multiple clinical trials for different clients in a single therapeutic class involving drugs with the same or similar chemical action has in the past and may in the future adversely affect our business if some or all of the clinical trials are canceled because of new scientific information or regulatory judgments that affect the drugs as a class or if industry consolidation results in the rationalization of drug development pipelines similarly marketing and selling drugs for different biopharmaceutical companies with similar chemical actions subjects us to risk if new scientific information or regulatory judgment prejudices the drugs as a class which may lead to compelled or voluntary prescription limitations or withdrawal of some or all of such drugs from the market 

our business is subject to international economic political and other risks that could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we have significant operations in countries that may require complex arrangements to deliver services throughout the world for our clients additionally we have established operations in locations remote from our most developed business centers as a result we are subject to heightened risks inherent in conducting business internationally including the following 











 











these risks and uncertainties could negatively impact our ability to among other things perform large global projects for our clients furthermore our ability to deal with these issues could be affected by applicable united states laws and the need to protect our assets any such risks could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations

exchange rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial condition 

because a large portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar and our financial statements are reported in united states dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition exchange rate fluctuations between local currencies and the united states dollar create risk in several ways including 





we may limit these risks through exchange rate fluctuation provisions stated in our service contracts or we may hedge our transaction risk with foreign currency exchange contracts or options we have not however hedged all of our foreign currency transaction risk and we may experience fluctuations in financial results from our operations outside the united states and foreign currency transaction risk associated with our service contracts 

 

due to the global nature of our business we may be exposed to liabilities under anticorruption laws including the united states foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and various international anticorruption laws and any allegation or determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are required to comply with the fcpa the uk bribery act and other international anticorruption laws which prohibit companies from engaging in bribery including corruptly or improperly offering promising or providing money or anything else of value to nonunited states officials and certain other recipients in addition the fcpa imposes certain books records and accounting control obligations on public companies and other issuers we operate in parts of the world in which corruption can be common and 

 

compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices our global operations face the risk of unauthorized payments or offers being made by employees consultants sales agents and other business partners outside of our control or without our authorization it is our policy to implement safeguards to prohibit these practices by our employees and business partners with respect to our operations however irrespective of these safeguards or as a result of monitoring compliance with such safeguards it is possible that we or certain other parties may discover or receive information at some point that certain employees consultants sales agents or other business partners may have engaged in corrupt conduct for which we might be held responsible violations of the fcpa the uk bribery act or other international anticorruption laws may result in restatements of or irregularities in our financial statements as well as severe criminal or civil sanctions and we may be subject to other liabilities which could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition in some cases companies that violate the fcpa may be debarred by the united states government andor lose their united states export privileges changes in anticorruption laws or enforcement priorities could also result in increased compliance requirements and related costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition the united states or other governments may seek to hold us liable for successor liability fcpa violations or violations of other anticorruption laws committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquired or will acquire 

we face risks related to sales to government entities 

we derive a portion of our revenue from sales to government entities in the united states in general our contracts with united states government entities are terminable at will by the government entity at any time government demand and payment for our services may be affected by publicsector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations including government shutdowns government contracts are subject to oversight including special rules on accounting expenses reviews and security failure to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions including termination of contracts fines and suspensions or debarment from future business with the united states government as a result failure to comply with these rules could have an adverse effect on our future business reputation operating results and financial condition 

if we are unable to successfully develop and market new services or enter new markets our growth results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

a key element of our growth strategy is the successful development and marketing of new services or entering new markets that complement or expand our existing business as we develop new services or enter new markets including services targeted at participants in the broader healthcare industry we may not have or adequately build the competencies necessary to perform such services satisfactorily may not receive market acceptance for such services or may face increased competition if we are unable to succeed in developing new services entering new markets or attracting a client base for our new services or in new markets we will be unable to implement this element of our growth strategy and our future business reputation results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our research  development solutions business could subject us to potential liability that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our research  development solutions business involves the testing of new drugs on patients in clinical trials and if marketing approval is granted the availability of these drugs to be prescribed to patients our involvement in the clinical trials and development process creates a risk of liability for personal injury to or death of patients particularly those with lifethreatening illnesses resulting from adverse reactions to the drugs administered during testing or after product launch respectively for example we have from time to time been sued and may be sued in the future by individuals alleging personal injury due to their participation in clinical trials and seeking damages from us under a variety of legal theories although we maintain the types and amounts of insurance we view as customary in the industries and countries in which we operate if we are required to pay damages or incur defense costs in connection with any personal injury claim that is outside the scope of indemnification agreements we have with our clients if any indemnification agreement is not performed in accordance with its terms or if our liability exceeds the amount of any applicable indemnification limits or available insurance coverage our financial condition results of operations and reputation could be materially and adversely affected we maintain professional liability insurance including liability for completed operations coverage in the future we may not be able to get adequate insurance for these types of risks at reasonable rates 

we also contract with physicians to serve as investigators in conducting clinical trials if the investigators commit errors or make omissions during a clinical trial that result in harm to clinical trial patients or after a clinical trial to a patient using the drug after it has received regulatory approval claims for personal injury or liability damages may result additionally if the investigators engage in fraudulent behavior clinical trial data may be compromised which may require us to repeat the clinical trial or subject us to liability we do not believe we are legally responsible for the medical care rendered by such thirdparty investigators and we would vigorously defend any claims brought against us however it is possible we could be found liable for claims with respect to the actions of thirdparty investigators which may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

 

some of our services involve direct interaction with clinical trial subjects or volunteers and subcontracting in to a network of phase i clinical facilities which could create potential liability that may adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and reputation  

we subcontract into a network of facilities where phase i clinical trials are conducted which ordinarily involve testing an investigational drug on a limited number of healthy individuals typically 20 to 80 persons to determine such drug’s basic safety failure to operate such a facility in accordance with applicable regulations could result in that facility being shut down which could disrupt our operations additionally we face risks associated with adverse events resulting from the administration of such drugs to healthy volunteers and the professional malpractice of medical care providers any professional malpractice or negligence by such investigators nurses or other subcontracted employees could potentially result in liability to us in the event of personal injury to or death of a healthy volunteer in clinical trials and could also cause us reputational harm this liability particularly if it were to exceed the limits of any indemnification agreements and insurance coverage we may have may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation

our contract sales  medical solutions business could result in liability to us if a drug causes harm to a patient while we are generally indemnified and insured against such risks we may still suffer financial losses 

when we market drugs under contract for a biopharmaceutical company we could suffer liability for harm allegedly caused by those drugs either as a result of a lawsuit against the biopharmaceutical company to which we are joined a lawsuit naming us or any of our subsidiaries or an action launched by a regulatory body while we are generally indemnified by the biopharmaceutical company for the action of the drugs we market on its behalf and we carry insurance to cover harm caused by our negligence in performing services it is possible that we could nonetheless incur financial losses regulatory penalties or both in particular any claim could result in potential liability for us if the claim is outside the scope of the indemnification agreement we have with the biopharmaceutical company the biopharmaceutical company does not abide by the indemnification agreement as required or the liability exceeds the amount of any applicable indemnification limits or available insurance coverage such a finding could have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and reputation furthermore negative publicity associated with harm caused by drugs we helped to market could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

our insurance may not cover all of our indemnification obligations and other liabilities associated with our operations 

we maintain insurance designed to provide coverage for ordinary risks associated with our operations and our ordinary indemnification obligations the coverage provided by such insurance may not be adequate for all claims we may make or may be contested by our insurance carriers if our insurance is not adequate or available to pay liabilities associated with our operations or if we are unable to purchase adequate insurance at reasonable rates in the future our profitability may be adversely impacted 

if we are unable to attract suitable investigators and patients for our clinical trials our clinical development business might suffer 

the timely recruitment of investigators and patients for clinical trials is essential to our research  development solutions business investigators are typically located at hospitals clinics or other sites and supervise the administration of the investigational drug to patients during the course of a clinical trial patients generally include people from the communities in which the clinical trials are conducted our clinical development business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract suitable and willing investigators or patients for clinical trials on a consistent basis for example if we are unable to engage investigators to conduct clinical trials as planned or enroll sufficient patients in clinical trials we might need to expend additional funds to obtain access to resources or else be compelled to delay or modify the clinical trial plans which may result in additional costs to us 

if we lose the services of key personnel or are unable to recruit additional qualified personnel our business could be adversely affected 

our success substantially depends on the collective performance contributions and expertise of our personnel including senior management and key personnel qualified professional scientific and technical operating staff and qualified sales representatives for our contract sales services there is significant and increasing competition for qualified personnel particularly those with higher educational degrees such as a medical degree a phd or an equivalent degree or relevant experience in the industry and in the locations in which we operate in addition the departure of our key employees or our inability to continue to identify attract and retain qualified personnel or replace any departed personnel in a timely fashion may impact our ability to grow our business and compete effectively in our industry and may negatively affect our ability to meet financial and operational goals 

 

 

disruptions in the credit and capital markets and unfavorable general economic conditions could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

disruptions in the credit and capital markets could have negative effects on our business that may be difficult to predict or anticipate including the ability of our clients vendors contractors and financing sources to meet their contractual obligations although we are unable to quantify the impact it has had on us we are aware of a limited number of instances in our research  development solutions business during the past several years where cancellations changes in scope and failure to pay timely were attributable at least in part to difficulty in our clients’ ability to obtain financing in the future such actions by our clients could if they involve a significant amount of business with us have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our effective income tax rate may fluctuate for a variety of reasons including the tax cuts and jobs act enacted in 2017 the “tax act” which may adversely affect our operations earnings and earnings per share 

our effective income tax rate is influenced by our projected profitability in the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate changes in a jurisdiction’s income tax rates and the distribution of our profits and losses among such jurisdictions may have a significant impact on our effective income tax rate which in turn could have an adverse effect on our net income and earnings per share factors that may affect our effective income tax rate include but are not limited to 















in addition our effective income tax rate is influenced by us tax law which has been substantially modified by the tax act currently regulations have been issued in proposed form and if the application of these provisions are modified to change the interpretation to us it could have an adverse impact on our effective income tax rate







all of these items described above may cause fluctuations in our effective income tax rate through increased us tax liability andor the loss of tax attributes in any given year that could adversely affect our results of operations and impact our earnings and earnings per share additional information regarding our income taxes is presented in note 16 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” or other standardsetting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements

we are required to prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” which is periodically revised andor expanded from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the fasb and the sec it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt such as amended guidance for leases may require additional changes to the current accounting treatment that we apply to our financial statements and may require us to make significant changes to our reporting systems such changes could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition

 

our relationships with existing or potential clients who are in competition with each other may adversely impact the degree to which other clients or potential clients use our services which may adversely affect our results of operations 

the biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive with biopharmaceutical companies each seeking to persuade payers providers and patients that their drug therapies are better and more costeffective than competing therapies marketed or being developed by competing firms in addition to the adverse competitive interests that biopharmaceutical companies have with each other biopharmaceutical companies also have adverse interests with respect to drug selection and reimbursement with other participants in the healthcare industry including payers and providers biopharmaceutical companies also compete to be first to market with new drug therapies we regularly provide services to biopharmaceutical companies who compete with each other and we sometimes provide services or funding to such clients regarding competing drugs in development our existing or future relationships with our biopharmaceutical clients may therefore deter other biopharmaceutical clients from using our services or may result in our clients seeking to place limits on our ability to serve other biopharmaceutical industry participants in connection with drug development activities in addition our further expansion into the broader healthcare market may adversely impact our relationships with biopharmaceutical clients and such clients may elect not to use our services reduce the scope of services that we provide to them or seek to place restrictions on our ability to serve clients in the broader healthcare market with interests that are adverse to theirs a loss of clients or reductions in the level of revenues from a client could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations business and prospects 

if we are unable to successfully identify acquire and integrate existing businesses services and technologies our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 

we anticipate that a portion of our future growth may come from acquiring existing businesses services or technologies the success of any acquisition will depend upon among other things our ability to effectively integrate acquired personnel operations services and technologies into our business and to retain the key personnel and clients of our acquired businesses in addition we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or obtain any necessary financing on commercially acceptable terms we may also spend time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition targets but not complete the transaction any future acquisition could involve other risks including among others the assumption of additional liabilities and expenses difficulties and expenses in connection with integrating the acquired companies and achieving the expected benefits issuances of potentially dilutive securities or interestbearing debt loss of key employees of the acquired companies transaction costs diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and with respect to the acquisition of foreign companies the inability to overcome differences in foreign business practices language and customs our failure to identify potential acquisitions complete targeted acquisitions and integrate completed acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

investments in our clients’ businesses or drugs and our related commercial rights strategies could have a negative impact on our financial performance 

we may enter into arrangements with our clients or other drug companies in which we take on some of the risk of the potential success or failure of their businesses or drugs including making strategic investments in our clients or other drug companies providing financing to clients or other drug companies or acquiring an interest in the revenues from clients’ drugs or in entities developing a limited number of drugs our financial results would be adversely affected if these investments or the underlying drugs result in losses or do not achieve the level of success that we anticipate andor our return or payment from the drug investment or financing is less than our direct and indirect costs with respect to these arrangements 

  our results of operations may be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our goodwill and intangible assets 

we assess the realizability of our indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill annually and conduct an interim evaluation whenever events or changes in circumstances such as operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset indicate that these assets may be impaired for example we recognized 40 million of impairment losses during the year ended december 31 2017 for goodwill and intangible assets in encore health resources llc “encore” which we sold in the third quarter of 2017 our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of the businesses we have acquired which in turn could depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses into our own business if we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets such impairment charges could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

 

we face risks arising from the restructuring of our operations 

from time to time we have adopted restructuring plans to improve our operating efficiency through various means such as reduction of overcapacity elimination of nonbillable support roles or other realignment of resources restructuring presents significant potential risks of events occurring that could adversely affect us including 











further any such restructuring would result in charges that if material could harm our results of operations and significantly reduce our cash position or increase debt in addition we may incur certain unforeseen costs once any restructuring activities are implemented further if we determine to effect any restructuring we can give no assurance that any projected cost reductions resulting from such restructuring activities will be achieved within the expected timeframe or at all 

because of these and other factors we cannot predict whether we will realize the purpose and anticipated benefits of these measures and if we do not our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

additionally there may be delays in implementing the restructuring activities or a failure to achieve the anticipated levels of cost savings and efficiency as a result of the restructuring activities each of which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations further restructuring or reorganization activities may also be required in the future beyond what is currently planned which could further enhance the risks associated with these activities 

 

risks relating to our industry 

the biopharmaceutical services industry is highly competitive 

the biopharmaceutical services industry is highly competitive our business often competes with other biopharmaceutical services companies internal discovery departments development departments sales and marketing departments information technology departments and other departments within our clients some of which could be considered large biopharmaceutical services companies in their own right with greater resources than ours we also compete with universities teaching hospitals governments agencies and others if we do not compete successfully our business will suffer the biopharmaceutical services industry is highly fragmented with numerous smaller specialized companies and a handful of companies with global capabilities similar to certain of our own capabilities increased competition has led to price and other forms of competition such as acceptance of less favorable contract terms that could adversely affect our operating results there are few barriers to entry for companies considering offering any one or more of the services we offer because of their size and focus these companies might compete effectively against us which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our future growth and success will depend on our ability to successfully compete with other companies that provide similar services in the same markets some of which may have financial marketing technical and other advantages we also expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of consolidation among these various companies large technology companies with substantial resources technical expertise and greater brand power could also decide to enter or further expand in the markets where our business operates and compete with us if one or more of our competitors or potential competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors or if a new entrant emerged with substantial resources the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively we compete on the basis of various factors including breadth and depth of services reputation reliability quality geographic coverage innovation security price and industry expertise and experience in addition our ability to compete successfully may be impacted by the growing availability of health information from social media government health information systems and other free or lowcost sources consolidation or integration of wholesalers retail pharmacies health networks payers or other healthcare stakeholders may lead any of them to provide information services directly to clients or indirectly through a designated service provider resulting in increased competition from firms that may have lower costs to market eg no data supply costs any of the above may result in lower demand for our services which could result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

outsourcing trends in the biopharmaceutical industry and changes in aggregate spending and research and development budgets could adversely affect our operating results and growth rate 

economic factors and industry trends that affect biopharmaceutical companies affect our research  development solutions business biopharmaceutical companies continue to seek longterm strategic collaborations with global contract research organizations with favorable pricing terms competition for these collaborations is intense and we may decide to forego an opportunity or we may not be selected in which case a competitor may enter into the collaboration and our business with the client if any may be limited in addition if the biopharmaceutical industry reduces its research  development solutions activities or reduces its outsourcing of clinical trials and sales and marketing projects or such outsourcing fails to grow at projected rates our operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected we may also be negatively impacted by consolidation and other factors in the biopharmaceutical industry which may slow decision making by our clients or result in the delay or cancellation of clinical trials our commercial services may be affected by reductions in new drug launches and increases in the number of drugs losing patent protection all of these events could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our business may be materially and adversely impacted by factors affecting the biopharmaceutical and healthcare industries 

the vast majority of our revenue is generated from sales to the biopharmaceutical and healthcare industries the clients we serve in these industries are commonly subject to financial pressures including but not limited to increased costs reduced demand for their products reductions in pricing and reimbursement for products and services formulary approval and placement government approval to market their products and limits on the manner by which they market their products loss of patent exclusivity whether due to patent expiration or as a result of a successful legal challenge and the proliferation of or changes to regulations applicable to these industries to the extent our clients face such pressures or they change how they utilize our offerings the demand for our services or the prices our clients are willing to pay for those services may decline any such decline could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 

we may be affected by healthcare reform and potential additional reforms 

the united states congress continues to consider healthcare reform legislation and impose health industry cost containment measures which may significantly impact the biopharmaceutical industry in addition numerous government bodies are considering or have adopted various healthcare reforms and may undertake or are in the process of undertaking efforts to control growing healthcare costs through legislation regulation and voluntary agreements with medical care providers and biopharmaceutical companies we are uncertain as to the effects of these recent reforms on our business and are unable to predict what legislative proposals if any will be adopted in the future if regulatory cost containment efforts limit the profitability of new drugs our clients may reduce their research and development spending or promotional marketing and sales expenditures which could reduce the business they outsource to us similarly if regulatory requirements are relaxed or simplified drug approval procedures are adopted the demand for our services could decrease 

foreign and domestic government bodies may also adopt healthcare legislation or regulations that are more burdensome than existing regulations for example product safety concerns and recommendations by the drug safety oversight board could change the regulatory environment for drug products and new or heightened regulatory and licensing requirements may increase our expenses or limit or delay our ability to offer some of our services additionally new or heightened regulatory requirements may have a negative impact on the ability of our clients to conduct industrysponsored clinical trials which could reduce the need for our services 

actions by government regulators or clients to limit a prescription’s scope or withdraw an approved drug from the market could adversely affect our business and result in a loss of revenues 

government regulators have the authority after approving a drug to regulate or limit its scope of prescription or withdraw it from the market completely based on safety concerns similarly clients may act to voluntarily limit the scope of prescription of drugs or withdraw them from the market in the past we have provided services with respect to drugs that have been limited andor withdrawn if we are providing services to clients for drugs that are limited or withdrawn we may be required to narrow the scope of or terminate our services with respect to such drugs which would prevent earning the full amount of revenues anticipated under the related service contracts with negative impacts to our financial results 

if we do not keep pace with rapid technological changes our services may become less competitive or obsolete 

the biopharmaceutical industry is subject to rapid technological changes our current competitors or other businesses might develop technologies or services that are more effective or commercially attractive than or render obsolete our current or future technologies and services if our competitors introduce superior technologies or services including in the provision of clinical services and if we cannot make enhancements to remain competitive our competitive position would be harmed if we are unable to compete successfully we may lose clients or be unable to attract new clients which could lead to a decrease in our revenue and financial condition 

laws restricting biopharmaceutical sales and marketing practices may adversely impact demand for our services 

there have been a significant number of laws legislative initiatives and regulatory actions over the years that seek to limit biopharmaceutical sales and marketing practices for example three states in 2006 and 2007 passed laws restricting the use of prescriber identifiable information for the purpose of promoting branded prescription medicines although these laws were subsequently declared to be unconstitutional based on a decision of the us supreme court in sorrell v ims health in 2011 we are unable to predict whether and in what form other initiatives may be introduced or actions taken at the state or federal levels to limit biopharmaceutical sales and marketing practices in addition while we will continue to seek to adapt our services to comply with the requirements of these laws to the extent applicable to our services if enacted there can be no assurance that our efforts to adapt our offerings will be successful and provide the same financial contribution to us there can also be no assurance that future legislative initiatives will not adversely affect our ability to develop or market current or future offerings or that any future laws will not diminish the demand for our services all of which could over time result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

 

our research  development solutions clients face intense competition from lower cost generic products which may lower the amount that they spend on our services 

our research  development solutions clients face increasing competition from lower cost generic products which in turn may affect their ability to pursue research and development activities with us in the united states eu and japan political pressure to reduce spending on prescription drugs has led to legislation and other measures which encourages the use of generic products in addition proposals emerge from time to time in the united states and other countries for legislation to further encourage the early and 

 

rapid approval of generic drugs loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by generic substitutes reducing our clients’ sales of that product and their overall profitability availability of generic substitutes for our clients’ drugs may adversely affect their results of operations and cash flow which in turn may mean that they would not have surplus capital to invest in research and development and drug commercialization including in our services if competition from generic products impacts our clients’ finances such that they decide to curtail our services our revenues may decline and this could have a material adverse effect on our business 

risks relating to our indebtedness 

restrictions imposed in the senior secured credit facilities as defined below and other outstanding indebtedness including the indentures governing outstanding notes issued by our wholly owned subsidiary iqvia inc may limit our ability to operate our business and to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 

the terms of the senior secured credit facilities restrict iqvia and its restricted subsidiaries from engaging in specified types of transactions these covenants restrict the ability of iqvia and its restricted subsidiaries among other things to 

























in addition the revolving credit facility and the term a and b loans under the credit agreement as defined below require iqvia to comply with a quarterly maximum senior secured net leverage ratio test and minimum interest coverage ratio test iqvia’s ability to comply with these financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and iqvia may not be able to satisfy them additionally the restrictions contained in the indentures governing the outstanding notes could also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions meet capital needs or make acquisitions or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans 

 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facilities or the indentures governing the outstanding notes which could trigger acceleration of our indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of or default under any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial results in the event of any default under the senior secured credit facilities the applicable lenders could elect to terminate borrowing commitments and declare all borrowings and loans outstanding together with accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and other obligations to be due and payable in addition or in the alternative the applicable lenders could exercise their rights under the security documents entered into in connection with the senior secured credit facilities iqvia and the other subsidiary guarantors have pledged substantially all of their tangible and intangible assets subject to customary exceptions as collateral under the senior secured credit facilities including the stock and the assets of certain of our current and future wholly owned united states subsidiaries and a portion of the stock of certain of our nonunited states subsidiaries 

if we were unable to repay or otherwise refinance these borrowings and loans when due the applicable lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation in the event the applicable lenders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness any acceleration of amounts due under the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities or the exercise by the applicable lenders of their rights under the security documents would likely have a material adverse effect on us 

despite our level of indebtedness we are able to incur more debt and undertake additional obligations incurring such debt or undertaking such additional obligations could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition 

although the credit agreement which governs the senior secured credit facilities of our wholly owned subsidiary through which we conduct our operations iqvia inc contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could increase in addition the receivables financing facility for one of our consolidated subsidiaries a bankruptcyremote special purpose entity the “spe” limits borrowing based on the amount of receivables purchased by the spe from certain of our other subsidiaries but when supported by the value of such purchased receivables the debt under our receivables financing facility can increase 

while the credit agreement also contains restrictions on our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to make loans and investments these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the investments incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 

restrictive covenants in our other indebtedness may limit our flexibility in our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to pursue our business strategies 

the terms contained in certain of our indebtedness including credit facilities and any future indebtedness of ours may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions including restrictions on our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to take actions that we believe may be in our interest these agreements among other things limit our ability to 





















 





a breach of the covenants or restrictions under the agreements governing our other indebtedness could result in a default under the applicable indebtedness such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in the event our lenders and noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we cannot assure that we and our subsidiaries would have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness 

our financial results our substantial indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of future financing 

interest rate fluctuations and our ability to deduct interest expense may affect our results of operations and financial condition 

because we have variable rate debt fluctuations in interest rates affect our business we attempt to minimize interest rate risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate caps and swaps we have entered into interest rate caps and swaps with financial institutions that have reset dates and critical terms that match those of our senior secured term loan credit facility accordingly any change in market value associated with the interest rate caps and swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt because we do not attempt to hedge all of our variable rate debt we may incur higher interest costs for the portion of our variable rate debt which is not hedged 

in addition the deduction for our interest expense may be limited which could have an adverse impact on our taxes and net income 

we may be adversely affected by changes in the method of determining the london interbank offered rate “libor” or the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate for our variable rate loans derivative contracts and other financial assets and liabilities

 

the interest rates under our credit facilities and related interest rate swaps may be impacted by the expected discontinuation of libor libor is used as a reference rate to calculate interest rates under our credit facilities in 2017 the united kingdoms financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 it is unclear if libor will cease to exist at that time or if new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 the banking industry alongside regulators have taken steps to introduce alternative reference rates to libor particularly in the us the uk and switzerland whether or not alternative reference rates attain market traction as a libor replacement tool remains in question if libor ceases to exist or another indexed rate gains wide market acceptance as the successor to libor our lenders will select a replacement index that will be applied under our credit facilities and related interest rate swaps and certain of the interest rates under our credit facilities may change the new rates may not be as favorable to us as those in effect prior to any libor phaseout

risks relating to ownership of our common stock 

provisions of the corporate governance documents of iqvia could make an acquisition of iqvia difficult and may prevent attempts by its stockholders to replace or remove its management even if beneficial to its stockholders 

our certificate of incorporation and delaware bylaws and the general corporation law of delaware the “dgcl” contain provisions that could make it difficult for a third party to acquire iqvia even if doing so might be beneficial to its stockholders including 









 







 

in addition iqvia is subject to section 203 of the dgcl regulating corporate takeovers section 203 subject to certain exceptions prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any “business combination” with any “interested stockholder” for a period of three years following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder unless 







in general section 203 defines “business combination” to include mergers or consolidations between a delaware corporation and an interested stockholder transactions with an interested stockholder involving the assets or stock of the corporation or its majorityowned subsidiaries and transactions which increase an interested stockholder’s percentage ownership of stock in general section 203 defines an “interested stockholder” as any entity or person beneficially owning 15 or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by stockholders to replace members of the board of directors because iqvia’s board is responsible for appointing the members of management these provisions could in turn affect any attempt to replace current members of management as a result stockholders of iqvia may lose their ability to sell their stock for a price in excess of the prevailing market price due to these protective measures and efforts by stockholders to change the direction or management of iqvia may be unsuccessful 

our operating results and share price may be volatile which could cause the value of our stockholders’ investments to decline 

our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future and such fluctuations may be significant in addition securities markets worldwide have experienced and are likely to continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could subject the market price of our shares to wide price fluctuations regardless of our operating performance our operating results and the trading price of our shares may fluctuate in response to various factors including 









 













 

these and other factors many of which are beyond our control may cause our operating results and the market price for our shares to fluctuate substantially while we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares and may otherwise negatively affect the market price and liquidity of our shares in addition in the past when the market price of a stock has been volatile holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock if any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation 

  since we have no current plans to pay regular cash dividends on our common stock stockholders may not receive any return on investment unless they sell their common stock for a price greater than that which they paid for it 

although we have previously declared dividends to our stockholders prior to our initial public offering in may 2013 we do not currently anticipate paying any regular cash dividends on our common stock any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board and will depend on among other things our results of operations financial condition cash requirements contractual restrictions and other factors that our board may deem relevant in addition our ability to pay dividends is and may be limited by covenants of existing and any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur including under our existing credit facilities therefore any return on investment in our common stock is solely dependent upon the appreciation of the price of our common stock on the open market which may not occur 

our certificate of incorporation contains a provision renouncing any interest and expectancy in certain corporate opportunities identified by certain of our affiliates even if such corporate opportunities are ones that we might reasonably be deemed to have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue 

our certificate of incorporation provides that iqvia renounces any interest or expectancy in the business opportunities of the tpg global llc the bain capital llc cpp investment board private holdings inc and leonard green  partners lp and their affiliates other than our company and our subsidiaries and all of their respective partners principals directors officers members managers managing directors andor employees and each such person will have no obligation to offer us such opportunities this provision applies to each of these stockholders and associated parties only for so long as a nominee designated by such stockholder under the shareholders agreement continues to serve on our board of directors and no individual serving our board of directors has at any time been designated as a nominee by such stockholder under the shareholders agreement stockholders are deemed to have notice of and have consented to this provision of our certificate of incorporation 

therefore a director or officer of our company who also serves as a director officer member manager or employee of such stockholders may pursue certain business opportunities including acquisitions that may be complementary to its business and as a result such opportunities may not be available to us these potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on the business financial condition results of operations or prospects of our company if attractive corporate opportunities are allocated by such stockholders to themselves or their other affiliates instead of to us

purchases of equity securities by the issuer

on october 30 2013 our board of directors the “board” approved an equity repurchase program the “repurchase program” authorizing the repurchase of up to 1250 million of either our common stock or vested inthemoney employee stock options or a combination thereof our board increased the stock repurchase authorization under the repurchase program with respect to the repurchase of our common stock by 600 million 15 billion 2 billion 15 billion and 20 billion in 2015 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively which increased the total amount that has been authorized under the repurchase program to 7725 billion the repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any particular amount of common stock or vested inthemoney employee stock options and it may be modified extended suspended or discontinued at any time the timing and amount of repurchases are determined by our management based on a variety of factors such as the market price of our common stock our corporate requirements and overall market conditions purchases of our common stock may be made in open market transactions effected through a brokerdealer at prevailing market prices in block trades or in privately negotiated transactions the repurchase program for common stock does not have an expiration date in addition from time to time we have repurchased and may continue to repurchase common stock through private or other transactions outside of the repurchase program 

from inception of the repurchase program through december 31 2019 we have repurchased a total of 60 billion of our securities under the repurchase program

during the year ended december 31 2019 we repurchased 6605804 shares of our common stock for approximately 9448 million under the repurchase program these amounts include 1000000 shares of our common stock which we repurchased directly from underwriters in connection with a secondary public offering of shares of our common stock held by certain of our selling stockholders for an aggregate purchase price of 1408 million and 1000000 shares of our common stock repurchased from certain selling stockholders in a private transaction for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 1569 million for additional information regarding our equity repurchases see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” and note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

as of december 31 2019 we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to 13 billion of our common stock under the repurchase program

  since the merger between quintiles and ims health we have repurchased 629 million shares of our common stock at an average market price per share of 9477 for an aggregate purchase price of 60 billion both under and outside of the repurchase program this includes shares withheld from employees to satisfy certain tax obligations due in connection with grants of stock under the quintiles ims holdings inc 2017 incentive and stock award plan the “plan” the plan provides for the withholding of shares to satisfy tax obligations it does not specify a maximum number of shares that can be withheld for this purpose the shares of common stock withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations may be deemed to be “issuer purchases” of shares that are required to be disclosed pursuant to this item

industry outlook 

for information about the industry outlook and markets that we operate in refer to part i item i “our market outlook” 

 

business combinations 

we have completed and will continue to consider strategic business combinations to enhance our capabilities and offerings in certain areas including various individually immaterial acquisitions during the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 these transactions were accounted for as business combinations and the acquired results of operations are included in our consolidated financial information since the acquisition date see note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information with respect to these business combinations 

sources of revenue 

total revenues are comprised of revenues from the provision of our services we do not have any material product revenues 

costs and expenses 

our costs and expenses are comprised primarily of our costs of revenue reimbursed expenses and selling general and administrative expenses costs of revenue include compensation and benefits for billable employees and personnel involved in production trial monitoring data management and delivery and the costs of acquiring and processing data for our information offerings costs of staff directly involved with delivering technologyrelated services offerings and engagements related accommodations and the costs of data purchased specifically for technology services engagements and other expenses directly related to service contracts such as courier fees laboratory supplies professional services and travel expenses as noted above reimbursed expenses are comprised principally of payments to investigators who oversee clinical trials and travel expenses for our clinical monitors and sales representatives selling general and administrative expenses include costs related to sales marketing and administrative functions including human resources legal finance quality assurance compliance and general management for compensation and benefits travel professional services training and expenses for information technology facilities and depreciation and amortization 

 

foreign currency translation 

in 2019 approximately 40 of our revenues were denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar which represents approximately 55 currencies because a large portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and our financial statements are reported in united states dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly affect our results of operations the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies and translated into united states dollars for financial reporting purposes accordingly exchange rate fluctuations will affect the translation of foreign results into united states dollars for purposes of reporting our condensed consolidated results as a result we believe that reporting results of operations that exclude the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations on certain financial results can facilitate analysis of period to period comparisons this constant currency information assumes the same foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect for the comparable prioryear period were used in translation of the current period results

 

consolidated results of operations 

  for information regarding our results of operations for technology  analytics solutions research  development solutions and contract sales  medical solutions refer to “segment results of operations” later in this section

in 2019 our revenues increased 676 million or 65 as compared to 2018 this increase was comprised of constant currency revenue growth of approximately 835 million or 80 and a negative impact of approximately 159 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency revenue growth was comprised of a 444 million increase in technology  analytics solutions a 378 million increase in research  development solutions and a 13 million increase in contract sales  medical solutions

costs of revenue exclusive of depreciation and amortization 



2019 compared to 2018

when compared to 2018 costs of revenue exclusive of depreciation and amortization in 2019 increased 554 million or 82 this increase included a constant currency increase of approximately 690 million or 102 and a positive impact of approximately 136 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency growth was comprised of a 369 million increase in technology  analytics solutions a 295 million increase in research  development solutions and a 26 million increase in contract sales  medical solutions 

as a percent of revenues costs of revenue remained flat compared to 2018 

 

selling general and adm inistrative expenses 



2019 compared to 2018

the 18 million increase in selling general and administrative expenses in 2019 as compared to 2018 included a constant currency increase of approximately 60 million or 35 and a positive impact of approximately 42 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency growth primarily consisted of a 34 million increase in research  development solutions and a 37 million increase in general corporate and unallocated expenses these increases were partially offset by a 6 million decrease in technology  analytics solutions and a 5 million decrease in contract sales  medical solutions

depreciation and amortization 



the 61 million increase in depreciation and amortization in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to higher intangible asset balances as a result of acquisitions occurring in 2018 and 2019 and increased amortization due to higher capitalized software balances

impairment charges 



during 2017 we recognized 40 million of impairment losses for declines in fair value of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets in encore see note 8 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information with respect to impairment charges 

restructuring costs 



during 2019 we recognized 75 million of restructuring charges net of reversals for changes in estimates under our existing restructuring plans as a result of continuing efforts to streamline our global operations the remaining actions under these plans as well as actions associated with upcoming 2020 plans are expected to occur throughout 2020 and are expected to consist of severance facility closure and other exitrelated costs 

during 2018 we recognized 68 million of restructuring charges net of reversals for changes in estimates respectively under our existing restructuring plans 

interest income and interest expense 



 

interest income include d interest received primarily from bank balances and investments 

 

interest expense during 2019 was higher than 2018 due to an increase in the average debt outstanding primarily as a result of the may 2019 issuance of 11 billion of 500 senior notes due 2027 and the june 2018 issuance of 163 billion of additional term b loans

loss on extinguishment of debt 



 

during 2019 we incurred 24 million of fees and expenses related to the redemption of our 4875 senior notes due 2023 in aggregate principal amount of 800 million as discussed further in note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

see “—liquidity and capital resources” for more information on these transactions 

other expense income net 



other income net for 2019 primarily consisted of a gain related to the remeasurement of a previously held equity interest of an equity method investment upon acquiring the remaining interest as a result of a business combination

other expense net for 2018 primarily consisted of an increase in fair value of acquisitionrelated contingent consideration and foreign currency net losses partially offset by positive returns on pension assets

income tax expense benefit



in 2019 the us treasury department issued final regulations on the transition tax and proposed regulations on foreign derived intangible income “fdii’ which we analyzed while the final regulations related to the transition tax did not have a material impact on us the proposed guidance for fdii had an unfavorable impact although the proposed guidance for fdii is not authoritative and subject to change in the regulatory review process we reversed the tax benefit recorded in 2018 by recording a tax expense of 25 million for this impact it is expected that during 2020 the us treasury department will issue final regulations on fdii

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax act the tax act is comprehensive legislation that includes provisions that lower the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 beginning in 2018 and imposes a onetime transition tax on undistributed foreign earnings asc 740 “income taxes” generally requires the effects of the tax law change to be recorded in the period of enactment however the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” to address situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computations in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the tax act during the fourth quarter of 2017 we recognized the tax impacts related to the transition tax on undistributed foreign earnings and the impact to deferred tax assets and liabilities and included these amounts in our consolidated financial statements on a provisional basis during the fourth quarter of 2018 we completed our accounting for sab 118 that resulted in a full year benefit of 35 million related to the transition tax additionally in 2018 as a result of the new provisions of the tax act we recorded a benefit of 25 million related to fdii as well as a tax expense of 35 million related to gilti our effective income tax rate was also favorably impacted by a tax benefit of 188 million related to purchase accounting amortization of approximately 813 million as a result of the merger

 

for 2017 we recorded a provisional deferred tax benefit of 966 million related to the revaluation of deferred taxes at the newly enacted 21 rate and the reversal of the deferred tax liability on undistributed foreign earnings net of the newly enacted transition tax we no longer consider any of our foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested our effective income tax rate was also favorably impacted by a tax benefit of 261 million related to purchase accounting amortization of approximately 763 million as a result of the merger 

 

equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates 



equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily as a result of earnings from our investment in novaquest pharma opportunities fund iii lp that were recognized in 2018 that did not reoccur in 2019 see note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 



net income attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily included quest’s interest in q 2 solutions 

segment results of operations 

revenues and profit by segment are as follows 



 

certain costs are not allocated to our segments and are reported as general corporate and unallocated expenses these costs primarily consist of stockbased compensation and expenses to integration activities and acquisitions we also do not allocate depreciation and amortization or impairment charges to our segments prior period segment results have been recast to conform to changes to management reporting in 2019 the recast impacts the allocation of selling general and administrative expenses for 2018 and 2017

 

 

technology  analytics solutions 



 

revenues 

2019 compared to 2018

technology  analytics solutions’ revenues were 4486 million in 2019 an increase of 349 million or 84 over 2018 this increase was comprised of constant currency revenue growth of approximately 444 million or 107 and a negative impact of approximately 95 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency growth resulted primarily from revenue growth in the americas region as well as the europe and africa region the revenue growth in these regions was driven by higher realworld and analytical services as well as incremental revenue from acquisitions

costs of revenue exclusive of depreciation and amortization 

2019 compared to 2018 

technology  analytics solutions’ costs of revenue exclusive of depreciation and amortization were 2663 million in 2019 an increase of 320 million over 2018 this increase was comprised of constant currency growth of approximately 369 million or 157 and a positive impact of approximately 49 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation and related expenses from higher headcount to support revenue growth and incremental costs from acquisitions

 

 

 

 

 

 

selling general and administrative expenses

2 019 compared to 2018 

technology  analytics solutions’ selling general and administrative expenses decreased 31 million in 2019 as compared to 2018 this decrease was comprised of a constant currency decrease of approximately 6 million or 08 and a positive impact of approximately 25 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency decrease was primarily related to cost savings initiatives 

research  development solutions 



backlog

research and development solutions contracted backlog increased from 171 billion at december 31 2018 to 190 billion at december 31 2019 and we expect approximately 52 billion of this backlog to convert to revenue in the next 12 months contracted backlog was 148 billion at december 31 2017 the december 31 2017 backlog amount has been updated to reflect the adoption of the new revenue standard

 

backlog represents at a particular point in time future revenues from work not yet completed or performed under signed contracts once work begins on a project revenues are recognized over the duration of the project backlog denominated in foreign currencies are valued each month using the actual average foreign exchange rates in effect during the month 

we believe that backlog may not be a consistent indicator of future revenues because backlog has been and likely will be affected by a number of factors including the variable size and duration of projects many of which are performed over several years cancellations and changes to the scope of work during the course of projects projects that have been delayed remain in backlog but the timing of the revenue generated may differ from the timing originally expected additionally projects may be terminated or delayed by the customer or delayed by regulatory authorities in the event that a client cancels a contract we typically would be entitled to receive payment for all services performed up to the cancellation date and subsequent clientauthorized services related to winding down the canceled project for more details regarding risks related to our backlog see part i item ia “risk factors—risks related to our business—the relationship of backlog to revenues varies over time”

revenues 

2019 compared to 2018 

research  development solutions’ revenues were 5788 million in 2019 an increase of 323 million or 59 over 2018 this increase was comprised of constant currency revenue growth of approximately 378 million or 69 and a negative impact of approximately 55 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations

research  development solutions’ costs of revenue exclusive of depreciation and amortization increased 215 million or 58 in 2019 as compared to 2018 this increase included a constant currency increase of approximately 295 million or 79 and a positive impact of approximately 80 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations 

the constant currency increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation and related expenses as well as incremental costs from acquisitions compensation and related expenses increased as a result of higher headcount to support revenue growth

selling general and administrative expenses

2019 compared to 2018 

research  development solutions’ selling general and administrative expenses increased 22 million or 32 in 2019 as compared to 2018 which included a constant currency increase of approximately 34 million or 49 and a positive impact of approximately 12 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency increase was primarily related to an increase in compensation and related expenses from higher headcount to support growth and incremental costs from acquisitions

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows in addition to operating cash flows other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include capital expenditures acquisitions investments debt service requirements dividends equity repurchases adequacy of our revolving credit and receivables financing facilities and access to the capital markets 

we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which those funds can be accessed on a costeffective basis the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences however those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations we have and expect to transfer cash from those subsidiaries to the united states and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so 

we had a cash balance of 837 million at december 31 2019 293 million of which was in the united states a decrease from 891 million at december 31 2018 

based on our current operating plan we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents future cash flows from operations and our ability to access funds under our revolving credit and receivables financing facilities will enable us to fund our operating requirements and capital expenditures and meet debt obligations for at least the next 12 months we regularly evaluate our debt arrangements as well as market conditions and from time to time we may explore opportunities to modify our existing debt arrangements or pursue additional financing arrangements that could result in the issuance of new debt securities by us or our affiliates we may use our existing cash cash generated from operations or dispositions of assets or businesses andor proceeds from any new financing arrangements or issuances of debt or equity securities to repay or reduce some of our outstanding obligations to repurchase shares from our stockholders or for other purposes as part of our ongoing business strategy we also continually evaluate new acquisition expansion and investment possibilities or other strategic growth opportunities as well as potential dispositions of assets or businesses as appropriate including dispositions that may cause us to recognize a loss on certain assets should we elect to pursue any such transaction we may seek to obtain debt or equity financing to facilitate those activities our ability to enter into any such potential transactions and our use of cash or proceeds is limited to varying degrees by the terms and restrictions contained in our existing debt arrangements we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to complete any such financing arrangements or other transactions on favorable terms or at all 

 

equity repurchase program 

on february 13 2019 the board increased the stock repurchase authorization under the “repurchase program by 20 billion which increased the total amount that has been authorized under the repurchase program to 7725 billion since the plan’s inception in october 2013 the repurchase program does not obligate the company to repurchase any particular amount of common stock and it may be modified extended suspended or discontinued at any time

as of december 31 2019 the company has remaining authorization to repurchase up to 13 billion of its common stock under the repurchase program in addition from time to time the company has repurchased and may continue to repurchase common stock through private or other transactions outside of the repurchase program

years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 

cash flow from operating activities 



2019 compared to 2018

cash provided by operating activities increased 163 million in 2019 as compared to 2018 the increase is primarily due to improved collections on receivables higher cashrelated net income and the timing of income tax and other payables

cash flow from investing activities



2019 compared to 2018 

cash used in investing activities increased 380 million in 2019 as compared to 2018 the increase was primarily due to higher cash used for the acquisition of property equipment and software 123 million and for the acquisition of businesses 279 million

cash flow from financing activities 



2019 compared to 2018 

cash used in financing activities decreased 176 million in 2019 as compared to 2018 the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily related to fewer share repurchases 456 million proceeds from debt issuance 269 million partially offset by repayment of revolving credit facility net of proceeds 370 million and debt repayment 167 million 

contingencies 

we are exposed to certain known contingencies that are material to our investors the facts and circumstances surrounding these contingencies and a discussion of their effect on us are in note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k these contingencies may have a material effect on our liquidity capital resources or results of operations in addition even where our reserves are adequate the incurrence of any of these liabilities may have a material effect on our liquidity and the amount of cash available to us for other purposes 

we believe that we have made appropriate arrangements in respect of the future effect on us of these known contingencies we also believe that the amount of cash available to us from our operations together with cash from financing will be sufficient for us to pay any known contingencies as they become due without materially affecting our ability to conduct our operations and invest in the growth of our business 

offbalance sheet arrangements

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business

 

contractual obligations and commitments 

below is a summary of our future payment commitments by year under contractual obligations as of december 31 2019 













application of critical accounting policies 

note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates and related disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes known actual results may differ from those estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

 

revenue recognition 

the majority of the company’s contracts within the research  development solutions segment are service contracts for clinical research that represent a single performance obligation the company provides a significant integration service resulting in a combined output which is clinical trial data that meets the relevant regulatory standards and can be used by the customer to progress to the next phase of a clinical trial or solicit approval of a treatment by the applicable regulatory body the performance obligation is satisfied over time as the output is captured in data and documentation that is available for the customer to consume over the course of the arrangement and furthers progress of the clinical trial the company recognizes revenue over time using a costbased input method since there is no single output measure that would fairly depict the transfer of control over the life of the performance obligation progress on the performance obligation is measured by the proportion of actual costs incurred to the total costs expected to complete the contract costs included in the measure of progress include direct labor and thirdparty costs such as payments to investigators and other pass through expenses for the company’s clinical monitors this costbased method of revenue recognition requires the company to make estimates of costs to complete its projects on an ongoing basis significant judgment is required to evaluate assumptions related to these estimates the effect of revisions to estimates related to the transaction price or costs to complete a project are recorded in the period in which the estimate is revised most contracts may be terminated upon 30 to 90 days notice by the customer however in the event of termination most contracts require payment for services rendered through the date of termination as well as for subsequent services rendered to close out the contract 

income taxes 

certain items of income and expense are not recognized on our income tax returns and financial statements in the same year which creates timing differences the income tax effect of these timing differences results in 1 deferred income tax assets that create a reduction in future income taxes and 2 deferred income tax liabilities that create an increase in future income taxes recognition of deferred income tax assets is based on management’s belief that it is more likely than not that the income tax benefit associated with certain temporary differences income tax operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and income tax credits would be realized we recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets for those deferred income tax items for which it was more likely than not that realization would not occur we determined the amount of the valuation allowance based in part on our assessment of future taxable income and in light of our ongoing income tax strategies if our estimate of future taxable income or tax strategies changes at any time in the future we would record an adjustment to our valuation allowance recording such an adjustment could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

income tax expense is based on the distribution of profit before income tax among the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate adjusted as required by the income tax laws of each taxing jurisdiction changes in the distribution of profits and losses among taxing jurisdictions may have a significant impact on our effective income tax rate we do not consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states 

 

business combinations 

we use the acquisition method to account for business combinations and accordingly the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recorded at their estimated fair values on the date of the acquisition we use significant judgments estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest including expected future cash flows discount rates that reflect the risk associated with the expected future cash flows and estimated useful lives 

we have recorded and allocated to our reporting units the excess of the cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired known as goodwill the recoverability of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated annually for impairment or if and when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment we review the carrying values of other identifiable intangible assets if the facts and circumstances indicate a possible impairment any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

 

stockbased compensation 

we measure compensation cost for stockbased payment awards stock options and stock appreciation rights granted to employees and nonemployee directors at fair value using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model and for performance awards using the monte carlo simulation model stockbased compensation expense includes stockbased awards granted to employees and nonemployee directors and has been reported in selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income based upon the classification of the individuals who were granted stockbased awards 

the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions including share price volatility the expected life of the award riskfree interest rate and the fair value of the underlying common shares on the date of grant in developing our assumptions we take into account the following 











pensions and other postretirement benefits

we provide retirement benefits to certain employees including defined benefit pension plans and postretirement medical plans the determination of benefit obligations and expense is based on actuarial models in order to measure benefit costs and obligations using these models critical assumptions are made with regard to the discount rate expected return on plan assets cash balance crediting rate lump sum conversion rate and the assumed rate of compensation increases in addition retiree medical care cost trend rates are a key assumption used exclusively in determining costs for our postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans 

recently issued accounting standards 

information relating to recently issued accounting standards is included in note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to various market risks and we regularly evaluate our exposure to such changes our overall risk management strategy seeks to balance the magnitude of the exposure and the cost and availability of appropriate financial instruments the following analyses present the sensitivity of our financial instruments to hypothetical changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period 

foreign currency exchange rates 

we transact business in more than 100 countries and approximately 55 currencies and are subject to risks associated with fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates our objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency exchange rate movements accordingly we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency cash flows related to service contracts and to hedge nonunited states dollar anticipated intercompany royalties it is our policy to enter into foreign currency transactions only to the extent necessary to meet our objectives as stated above we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for investment or speculative purposes the principal currencies hedged are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the swiss franc and the canadian dollar

the contractual value of our foreign exchange derivative instruments all of which were foreign exchange forward contracts was approximately 148 million at december 31 2019 the fair value of these contracts is subject to change as a result of potential changes in foreign exchange rates we assess our market risk based on changes in foreign exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential gain or loss in fair values based on a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates the potential gain in fair value for foreign exchange forward contracts based on a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the united states dollar or in the case of nonunited states dollar related contracts the currency being purchased was less than 1 million at december 31 2019 however the change in the fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts would likely be offset by a change in the value of the future service contract revenue or royalty being hedged caused by the currency exchange rate fluctuation the estimated fair values of the foreign exchange forward contracts were determined based on quoted market prices 

exchange rate fluctuations affect the united states dollar value of foreign currency revenue and expenses and may have a significant effect on our results excluding the impacts from any outstanding or future hedging transactions a hypothetical 10 change in average exchange rates used to translate all foreign currencies to the united states dollar would have impacted income before income taxes for 2019 by approximately 165 million the actual impact of exchange rate movements in the future could differ materially from this hypothetical analysis based on the mix of foreign currencies and the timing and magnitude of individual exchange rate movements 

additionally commencing in 2016 we designated a portion of our foreign currency denominated debt as a hedge of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries to reduce the volatility in stockholders’ equity caused by changes in the euro exchange rate with respect to the united states dollar as of december 31 2019 these borrowings net of original issue discount were €5273 million 5915 million a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the united states dollar would lead to a potential loss in fair value of 592 million however this change in fair value would be offset by the change in value of the hedged portion of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries caused by the currency exchange rate fluctuation   

interest rates 

because we have variable rate debt fluctuations in interest rates affect our business we attempt to minimize interest rate risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps we have entered into interest rate swaps with financial institutions that have reset dates and critical terms that match the underlying debt accordingly any change in market value associated with the interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt as of december 31 2019 we had approximately 59 billion of variable rate indebtedness and interest rate swaps with a notional value of 12 billion because we do not attempt to hedge all of our variable rate debt we may incur higher interest costs for the portion of our variable rate debt that is not hedged excluding debt covered by hedges each quarterpoint increase or decrease in the interest rate on our variable rate debt would result in our interest expense changing by approximately 11 million per year 

marketable securities 

at december 31 2019 we held investments in marketable equity securities these investments are classified as either trading securities or availableforsale securities and are recorded at fair value these securities are subject to price risk as of december 31 2019 the fair value of these investments was 62 million based on the quoted market value of the securities the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease of 10 in quoted market values was approximately 6 million at december 31 2019

we combine our proprietary information assets with advanced analytics transformative technology and domain expertise to develop clinical and commercial capabilities that enable us to grow our relationships with healthcare stakeholders throughout the life science’s value chain this set of capabilities includes













 

our missioncritical relationships with our life science clients consist of four important decisionmaking processes related to their product portfolios research and development prelaunch launch and inmarket we continue to develop software and services applications to further deepen our level of client integration by enabling our clients to enhance andor automate many components of these key decisionmaking processes 



 

we believe that a powerful component of our value proposition is the breadth and depth of intelligence we provide to help our clients address fundamental operational questions 

 



 

our market opportunity 

we compete in a market of greater than 230 billion consisting of outsourced research and development realworld evidence and connected health and technology enabled commercial operations markets for life sciences companies and the broader healthcare industry the following sets forth our estimates for the size of our principal markets 







in deriving estimates of the size of the various markets described above we review thirdparty sources which include estimates and forecasts of spending in various segments in combination with internal iqvia research and analysis informed by our experience serving these segments as well as projected growth rates for each of these segments see “industry and market data” above   

we believe there are six key trends affecting our end markets that will create increasing demand for research and development services and technology  analytics solutions  

growth and innovation in the life sciences industry the life sciences industry is a large and critical part of the global healthcare system and according to the latest information available from the iqvia market prognosis service is estimated to have generated approximately 12 trillion in revenue in 2018 according to our research revenue growth in the life sciences industry globally is expected to range from 3 to 6 between 2019 and 2023 according to the iqvia institute it is estimated that spending on pharmaceuticals in emerging markets will expand at a 5 to 8 compound annual growth rate “cagr” through 2023 the growth of emerging markets is making these geographies strategically important to life sciences organizations and consistent with their approach in the developed markets we expect these organizations to apply a high degree of sophistication to their commercial operations in these countries for global companies this requires highly localized knowledge and information assets the development of market access strategies and performance benchmarking in addition local players are learning that they need to compete on the basis of improved information and analytics 

growth in research and development spending trends in research and development are impacted as a result of several factors including major biopharmaceutical companies’ efforts to replenish revenues lost from the socalled “patent cliff” increased access to capital by the small and midcap biotechnology industry and recent increases in pharmaceutical approvals by regulatory authorities the iqvia institute also estimates that approximately 270 new molecular entities “nmes” are expected to be approved between 2019 and 2023 compared to 230 between 2014 and 2018 and 182 between 2009 and 2013 we believe that further research and development spending combined with the continued need for cost efficiency across the healthcare landscape will continue to create opportunities for biopharmaceutical services companies particularly those with a global reach and broad service offerings to help biopharmaceutical companies with their pre and postlaunch solutions development and commercialization needs 

 

increased complexity in research and development biopharmaceutical companies face environments in which it has become increasingly difficult to operate improved standards of care in many therapeutic areas and the emergence of new types of therapies such as biologics genetically targeted therapies gene and stem cell therapies and other treatment modalities have led to more complex development and regulatory pathways for example the united states and european countries have recently released guidelines for the development of “biosimilar” products we believe that our global clinical development capabilities including our expertise in biomarkers and genomics and our global laboratory network position us well to help biopharmaceutical companies manage the complexities inherent in an environment where this type of expertise is important for example the iqvia core™ helps us validate protocols to ensure studies in new disease areas have greater accuracy and also enables us through innovations such as predictive analytics  to find patients who may not have been diagnosed 

regulators require clinical trials involving local populations as part of the process for approving new pharmaceutical products especially in certain asian and emerging markets understanding the epidemiological and physiological differences in different ethnic populations and being able to conduct clinical trials locally in certain geographies will be important to pharmaceutical product growth strategies both for multinational and localregional biopharmaceutical companies we believe that our global clinical development capabilities and unmatched presence in asia and other emerging markets make us a strong partner for biopharmaceutical companies managing the complexities of international drug development 

financial pressures driving the need for increased efficiency despite expected accelerating growth in the global life sciences market we believe our clients will face increased operating margin pressure due to their changing product mix pricing and reimbursement challenges and rising costs of compliance product portfolios for life sciences companies have shifted toward specialty products with lower peak market sales potential than traditional primary care medicines we believe that the need for biopharmaceutical companies to maximize productivity and lower costs across their processes from research and development through commercial operations will cause them to look to partners as they enter into outsourcing arrangements to improve efficiency further our clients are looking for new ways to simplify processes and drive operational efficiencies by using automation consolidating vendors and adopting new technology options such as hosted and cloudbased applications this provides opportunities for technology services vendors to capture and consolidate internal spending by providing lowercost and variablecost options that lower clients’ research and development selling marketing and administrative costs 

evolving need to integrate and structure expanding sources of data over the past decade many health systems around the world have focused on digitizing medical records while such records theoretically enhance access to data relevant information is often unintegrated unstructured siloed in disparate software systems or entered inconsistently in addition new sources of data from the internet such as social media and information on limited patient pools and information resulting from enhanced diagnostic technologies are creating new sources of healthcare data 

in order to derive valuable insights from existing and expanding sources of information clients need access to statistically significant data sets organized into databases that can be queried and analyzed for example realworld evidence studies demonstrate practical and clinical efficacies which we believe require the aggregation and integration of large clinical data sets across all care settings types of therapies and patient cohorts longitudinal studies require analysis of nonidentified patient diagnoses treatments procedures and laboratory test results to identify types of patients that will likely best respond to particular therapies finally manufacturers also require the ability to analyze social media activity to identify unmet patient needs and support for new orphan drugs this information is highly relevant to all healthcare stakeholders and we believe the opportunity to more broadly apply healthcare data can only be realized through structuring organizing and integrating new and existing forms of data in conjunction with sophisticated analytics 

need for demonstrated value in healthcare participants in the healthcare industry are focused on improving quality and reducing costs both of which require assessment of quality and value of therapies and providers as a result physicians no longer make prescribing decisions in isolation but rather in the context of guidance and rules from payers integrated delivery networks and governments we believe life sciences companies are working to bring alignment across constituents on the value of their treatments in order to successfully develop and commercialize new therapies 

there is increasing pressure on life sciences companies to support and justify the value of their therapies many new drugs that are being approved are more expensive than existing therapies and will likely receive heightened scrutiny by regulators and payers to determine whether the existing treatment options would be sufficient additionally many new specialty drugs are molecularbased therapies and require a more detailed understanding of clinical factors and influencers that demonstrate therapeutic value as a result leading life sciences companies are utilizing more sophisticated outcome research and data analytics services 

 

we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of these global trends in healthcare beyond our proprietary information assets we have developed key capabilities to assess opportunities to develop and commercialize therapies support and defend the value of medicines and help our clients operate more efficiently through the application of insightdriven decisionmaking and costefficient technology solutions

government regulation 

many aspects of our businesses are regulated by federal and state laws rules and regulations accordingly we maintain a robust compliance program aimed at ensuring we operate our business in compliance with all existing legal requirements material to the operation of our businesses there are however occasionally uncertainties involving the application of various legal requirements the violation of which could result in among other things fines or other sanctions see “part i—item 1a—risk factors” for additional detail 

good clinical practice 

good clinical practice “gcp” regulations and guidelines are the industry standard for the conduct of clinical trials with respect to maintaining the integrity of the data and safety of the research subjects the united states food and drug administration “fda” the european medicines agency “ema” japan’s ministry of health labour and welfare and most other global regulatory authorities expect that study results and data submitted to such authorities be based on clinical trials conducted in accordance with gcp provisions records for clinical trials must be maintained for specified periods for inspection by the fda and other regulators 

regulation of drugs biologics and medical devices 

in the united states pharmaceutical biological and medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by the fda the federal food drug and cosmetic act “fdc act” the public health service act “phs act” and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern among other things the research development testing manufacture storage recordkeeping approval labeling promotion and marketing distribution postapproval monitoring and reporting sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical biological and medical device products failure to comply with applicable united states requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions such as fda refusal to approve a pending new drug application “nda” for a new drug a biologics license application “bla” for a new biological product premarket approval “pma” or clearance for a new medical device warning or untitled letters clinical holds product recalls product seizures total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions fines civil penalties and criminal prosecution 

 

regulation of patient information 

our information management services relate to the processing of information regarding patient diagnosis and treatment of disease and are therefore subject to substantial governmental regulation in addition the confidentiality of patientspecific information and the circumstances under which such patientspecific records may be released for inclusion in our databases or used in other aspects of our business is heavily regulated federal state and foreign governments are contemplating or have proposed or adopted additional legislation governing the possession use and dissemination of personal data such as personal health information and personal financial data as well as security breach notification rules for loss or theft of such data additional legislation or regulation of this type might among other things require us to implement additional security measures and processes or bring within the legislation or regulation deidentified health or other data each of which may require substantial expenditures or limit our ability to offer some of our services 

in particular personal health information is recognized in many countries such as the united states the european union or eu and several countries in asia as a special sensitive category of personal information subject to additional mandatory protections violations of data protection regulations are subject to administrative penalties civil money penalties and criminal prosecution including corporate fines and personal liability 

regulation of promotion marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products and medical devices 

certain of our services are subject to detailed and comprehensive regulation in each geographic market in which we operate such regulation relates among other things to the distribution of drug samples the marketing and promotion of approved products the qualifications of sales representatives and the use of healthcare professionals in sales functions 

in the united states certain of our services are subject to numerous federal and state laws pertaining to promotional activities involving pharmaceutical products and medical devices certain of our services are subject to the fda’s regulations against “offlabel promotion” which require sales representatives to restrict promotion of the approved product they are detailing to the approved labeling for the product the prescription drug marketing act imposes licensing personnel record keeping packaging labeling product handling and facility storage and security requirements other federal and state laws prohibit manufacturers suppliers and providers from offering giving or receiving kickbacks or other remuneration in connection with ordering or recommending the purchase or rental of healthcare items and services the sale or distribution of pharmaceutical products and devices is also governed by the united states federal trade commission act and state consumer protection laws we are subject to similar regulations currently in effect in the other countries where we offer contract sales  medical solutions  

we are also subject to various laws and regulations that may apply to certain drug and device promotional practices including among others various aspects of medicare and federal healthcare programs violations of these laws and regulations may result in criminal andor civil penalties including possibly as an “aider and abettor”   

regulation of laboratories 

our united states “central” laboratories are subject to licensing and regulation under federal state and local laws relating to hazard communication and employee righttoknow regulations and the safety and health of laboratory employees additionally our united states laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations and licensing requirements relating to the handling storage and disposal of hazardous waste radioactive materials and laboratory specimens including the regulations of the environmental protection agency the nuclear regulatory commission the department of transportation the national fire protection agency and the united states drug enforcement administration “dea” the use of controlled substances in testing for drugs with a potential for abuse is regulated in the united states by the dea and by similar regulatory bodies in other parts of the world our united states laboratories using controlled substances for testing purposes are licensed by the dea the regulations of the united states department of transportation public health service and postal service apply to the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens our laboratories also are subject to international air transport association regulations which govern international shipments of laboratory specimens furthermore when the materials are sent to a foreign country the transportation of such materials becomes subject to the laws rules and regulations of such foreign country our laboratories outside the united states are subject to applicable national laws governing matters such as licensing the handling and disposal of medical specimens genetic material hazardous waste and radioactive materials as well as the health and safety of laboratory employees 

in addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace the united states occupational safety and health administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers may be exposed to bloodborne pathogens such as hiv and the hepatitis b virus although we believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with such federal state and local laws failure to comply with such laws could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business fines criminal penalties and other enforcement actions 

 

further laboratories that analyze human blood or other biological samples for the diagnosis and treatment of clinical trial subjects must comply with clinical laboratory improvement amendments “clia” as well as requirements established by various states the failure to meet these requirements may result in civil penalties and suspension or revocation of the clia certification 

our intellectual property 

in addition to our proprietary data sets described above we develop and use a number of proprietary methodologies analytics systems technologies and other intellectual property in the conduct of our business we rely upon a combination of legal technical and administrative safeguards to protect our proprietary and confidential information and trade secrets and patent copyright and trademark laws to protect other intellectual property rights we consider our trademark and related names marks and logos to be of material importance to our business and we have registered or applied for registration for certain of these trademarks including iqvia in the united states and other jurisdictions and aggressively seek to protect them trademarks and service marks generally may be renewed indefinitely so long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained and so long as they have not been found to have become generic the technology and other intellectual property rights owned and licensed by us are of importance to our business although our management believes that our business as a whole is not dependent upon any one intellectual property or group of such properties

 item 1a risk factors 

risk factors

we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks some of which are beyond our control you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below together with the other information included in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating our company the occurrence of any of the following risks may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects 

risks relating to our business 

the potential loss or delay of our large contracts or of multiple contracts could adversely affect our results 

most of our research  development solutions clients can terminate our contracts upon 30 to 90 days notice our clients may delay terminate or reduce the scope of our contracts for a variety of reasons beyond our control including but not limited to 























as a result contract terminations delays and alterations are a regular part of our research  development solutions business in the event of termination our contracts often provide for fees for winding down the project but these fees may not be sufficient for us to maintain our margins and termination may result in lower resource utilization rates in addition we will not realize the full benefits of our backlog of contractually committed services if our clients cancel delay or reduce their commitments under our contracts with them which may occur if among other things a client decides to shift its business to a competitor or revoke our status as a preferred provider thus the loss or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could adversely affect our revenues and profitability we believe the risk of loss or delay of multiple contracts potentially has greater effect where we are party to broader partnering arrangements with global biopharmaceutical companies 

 

  we depend on third parties for data and support services our suppliers or providers might restrict our use of or refuse to license data or provide services which could lead to our inability to access certain data or provide certain services and as a result materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

each of our technology  analytics solutions information services is derived from data we collect from third parties these data suppliers are numerous and diverse reflecting the broad scope of information that we collect and use in our business 

although we typically enter into longterm contractual arrangements with many of these suppliers of data at the time of entry into a new contract or renewal of an existing contract suppliers may increase restrictions on our use of such data increase the price they charge us for data or refuse altogether to license the data to us in addition during the term of any data supply contract suppliers may fail to adhere to our data quality control standards or fail to deliver data further although no single individual data supplier is material to our business if a number of suppliers collectively representing a significant amount of data that we use for one or more of our services were to impose additional contractual restrictions on our use of or access to data fail to adhere to our qualitycontrol standards repeatedly fail to deliver data or refuse to provide data now or in the future our ability to provide those services to our clients could be materially adversely impacted which may harm our operating results and financial condition 

additionally we depend on third parties for support services to our business such support services include but are not limited to thirdparty transportation providers suppliers of drugs for patients participating in clinical trials suppliers of kits for use in our clinical trial laboratories business suppliers of reagents for use in our testing equipment and providers of maintenance contracts for our equipment the failure of any of these third parties to adequately provide the critical support services could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if we fail to perform our services in accordance with contractual requirements regulatory standards and ethical considerations we could be subject to significant costs or liability and our reputation could be harmed 

we contract with biopharmaceutical companies to perform a wide range of services to assist them in bringing new drugs to market our services include monitoring clinical trials data and laboratory analysis electronic data capture patient recruitment and other related services and we perform these services in a number of ways including through physical and technologyenabled efforts such services are complex and subject to contractual requirements regulatory standards and ethical considerations for example we must adhere to regulatory requirements such as the fda and current gcp and good laboratory practice requirements if we fail to perform our services in accordance with these requirements regulatory agencies may take action against us for failure to comply with applicable regulations governing clinical trials or sales and marketing practices such actions may include sanctions such as injunctions or failure of such regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of products delay suspension or withdrawal of approvals license revocation product seizures or recalls operational restrictions civil or criminal penalties or prosecutions damages or fines clients may also bring claims against us for breach of our contractual obligations and patients in the clinical trials and patients taking drugs approved on the basis of those clinical trials may bring personal injury claims against us for negligence any such action could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and reputation 

such consequences could arise if among other things the following occur 

improper performance of our services the performance of clinical development services is complex and timeconsuming for example we may make mistakes in conducting a clinical trial that could negatively impact or obviate the usefulness of the clinical trial or cause the results of the clinical trial to be reported improperly if the clinical trial results are compromised we could be subject to significant costs or liability which could have an adverse impact on our ability to perform our services as examples 







large clinical trials can cost up to hundreds of millions of dollars and while we endeavor to contractually limit our exposure to such risks improper performance of our services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition damage our reputation and result in the cancellation of current contracts by or failure to obtain future contracts from the affected client or other clients 

 

investigation of clients from time to time one or more of our clients are audited or investigated by regulatory authorities or enforcement agencies with respect to regulatory compliance of their clinical trials programs or the marketing and sale of their drugs in these situations we have often provided services to our clients with respect to the clinical trials programs or activities being audited or investigated and we are called upon to respond to requests for information by the authorities and agencies there is a risk that either our clients or regulatory authorities could claim that we performed our services improperly or that we are responsible for clinical trial or program compliance if our clients or regulatory authorities make such claims against us and prove them we could be subject to damages fines or penalties in addition negative publicity regarding regulatory compliance of our clients’ clinical trials programs or drugs could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

insufficient client funding to complete a clinical trial as noted above clinical trials can cost hundreds of millions of dollars there is a risk that we may initiate a clinical trial for a client and then the client becomes unwilling or unable to fund the completion of the clinical trial in such a situation notwithstanding the client’s ability or willingness to pay for or otherwise facilitate the completion of the clinical trial we may be ethically bound to complete or wind down the clinical trial at our own expense 

security breaches and unauthorized use of our it systems and information or the it systems or information in the possession of our vendors could expose us our clients our data suppliers or others to risk of loss 

we rely upon the security of our computer and communications systems infrastructure to protect us from cyberattacks and unauthorized access cyberattacks can include malware computer viruses hacking or other significant disruption of our computer communications and related systems cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems as cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against one or more cyber threats might defeat the measures that we or our vendors take to anticipate detect avoid or mitigate such threats certain techniques used to obtain unauthorized access introduce malicious software disable or degrade service or sabotage systems may be designed to remain dormant until a triggering event and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures since techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources although we take steps to manage and avoid these risks and to prevent their recurrence our preventive and remedial actions may not be successful such attacks whether successful or unsuccessful could result in our incurring costs related to for example rebuilding internal systems defending against litigation responding to regulatory inquiries or actions paying damages or fines or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties publicity about vulnerabilities and attempted or successful incursions could damage our reputation with clients and data suppliers and reduce demand for our services 

we also store proprietary and sensitive information in connection with our business which could be compromised by a cyberattack to the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data an inappropriate disclosure of proprietary or sensitive information an inability to access data sources or an inability to process data or provide our offerings to our clients it could cause significant damage to our reputation affect our relationships with our data suppliers and clients including loss of suppliers and clients lead to claims against us and ultimately harm our business we may be required to incur significant costs to alleviate remedy or protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future we may also face inquiry or increased scrutiny from government agencies as a result of any such disruption or breach while we have insurance coverage for certain instances of a cyber security breach our coverage may not be sufficient if we suffer a significant attack or multiple attacks any such breach or disruption could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and our reputation as a provider of missioncritical services 

some of our vendors have significant responsibility for the security of certain of our data centers and computerbased platforms also our data suppliers have responsibility for security of their own computer and communications environments these third parties face risks relating to cyber security similar to ours which could disrupt their businesses and therefore materially impact ours accordingly we are subject to any flaw in or breaches to their computer and communications systems or those that they operate for us which could result in a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial results 

failure to meet productivity objectives under our internal business transformation initiatives could adversely impact our competitiveness and harm our operating results 

we are pursuing business transformation initiatives to update technology increase innovation and obtain operating efficiencies as part of these initiatives we seek to improve our productivity flexibility quality functionality and cost savings by investing in the development and implementation of global platforms and integration of our business processes and functions to achieve economies of scale for example we are evaluating our site activation processes and procedures including technology enablement platforms and implementing changes to accelerate site startup timelines and provide greater transparency to clients and investigator sites these various initiatives may not yield their intended gains or be completed in timely manner which may impact our competitiveness and our ability to meet our growth objectives and as a result materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

 

if we are unsuccessful at investing in growth opportunities our business could be materially and adversely affected 

we continue to invest significantly in growth opportunities including the development and acquisition of new data technologies and services to meet our clients’ needs for example we are expanding our services and technology offerings such as the development of a cloudbased platform with a growing number of applications to support commercial operations for life sciences companies eg multichannel marketing marketing campaign management customer relationship management incentive compensation management targeting and segmentation performance management and other applications we also continue to invest significantly in growth opportunities in emerging markets such as the development launch and enhancement of services in china india russia turkey and other countries we believe healthcare spending in these emerging markets will continue to grow over the next five years and we consider our presence in these markets to be an important focus of our growth strategy 

there is no assurance that our investment plans or growth strategy will be successful or will produce a sufficient or any return on our investments further if we are unable to develop new technologies and services clients do not purchase our new technologies and services our new technologies and services do not work as intended or there are delays in the availability or adoption of our new technologies and services then we may not be able to grow our business or growth may occur slower than anticipated additionally although we expect continued growth in healthcare spending in emerging markets such spending may occur more slowly or not at all and we may not benefit from our investments in these markets

we plan to fund growth opportunities with cash from operations or from future financings there can be no assurance that those sources will be available in sufficient amounts to fund future growth opportunities when needed 

any of the foregoing could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

data protection privacy and similar laws in the united states and around the world restrict access use and disclosure of personal information and failure to comply with or adapt to changes in these laws could materially and adversely harm our business 

the confidentiality collection use and disclosure of personal data including individually identifiable health information and clinical trial patientspecific information are subject to governmental regulation generally in the country that the personal data were collected or used for example united states federal regulations under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” create specific requirements for the protection of the privacy and security of individual health information these provisions apply to both “covered entities” primarily health care providers and health insurers and their “business associates” or service providers as there are some instances where we are a hipaa “business associate” of a “covered entity” we can be directly liable for mishandling protected health information under hipaa’s enforcement scheme we can be subject to significant penalties in connection with hipaa violations along with the potential for significant other expenditures related to these activities these rules require individuals’ written authorization in many situations in addition to any required informed consent before protected health information may be used for research we are both directly and indirectly affected by the privacy provisions surrounding individual authorizations because many investigators with whom we are involved in clinical trials are directly subject to them as a hipaa “covered entity” and because we obtain identifiable health information from third parties that are subject to such regulations the laws and regulations related to the protection of personal health information in connection with research activities are under reevaluation particularly in the united states and changes to these regulations could have a material adverse impact on our ability to provide some of our services in their current form or maintain our profitability in general patient health information is among the most sensitive and highly regulated of personal information and laws and regulations around the united states and the world are designed to ensure that information about an individual’s healthcare is properly protected from inappropriate access use and disclosure laws restricting access use and disclosure of patient health information also include the european union’s “eu” general data protection regulation canada’s personal information protection and electronic documents act and other data protection privacy data security and similar national stateprovincial and local laws in the eu personal data includes any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person with health information carrying additional obligations including obtaining the explicit consent from the individual for collection use or disclosure of the information in addition we are subject to eu rules with respect to crossborder transfers of such data out of the eu along with similar data transfer requirements in other countries the united states the eu and its member states and other countries where we have operations such as china japan malaysia philippines russia south korea and singapore continue to issue new privacy and data protection rules and regulations that relate to personal data and health information 

 

we have established frameworks models processes and technologies to manage privacy and security for many data types from a variety of sources and under myriad privacy and data protection laws worldwide in addition we rely on our data suppliers to deliver information to us in a form and in a manner that complies with applicable privacy and data protection laws these laws are complex and there is no assurance that the safeguards and controls employed by us or our data suppliers will be sufficient to prevent a breach of these laws or that claims will not be filed against us or our data suppliers despite such safeguards and controls failure to comply with such laws certain certificationregistration and annual recertificationregistration provisions associated with these data protection and privacy regulations and similar rules in various jurisdictions or to resolve any serious privacy complaints may result in among other things regulatory sanctions criminal prosecution civil liability negative publicity damage to our reputation or data being blocked from use or liability under contractual provisions for example in july 2015 indictments were issued by the seoul central district prosecutors’ office in south korea against ims korea and two of its employees among others alleging improper handling of sensitive health information in violation of applicable privacy laws see item 3 “legal proceedings” for additional information 

laws and expectations relating to privacy continue to evolve and we continue to adapt to changing needs for example the definition of “personally identifiable information” and “personal data” continues to evolve and broaden and many new laws and regulations are being enacted in addition certain longestablished programs have been or are at risk of being declared invalid such as the euus safe harbor framework that operated for many years but was struck down by european courts in 2015 so that this area remains in a state of flux changes to these programs may adversely impact our ability to provide services to our clients or develop new products or services federal state and foreign governments are contemplating or have proposed or adopted additional legislation governing the collection possession use or dissemination of personal data such as personal health information and personal financial data as well as security breach notification rules for loss or theft of such data additional legislation or regulation of this type might among other things require us to implement new security measures and processes or bring within the legislation other personal data not currently regulated each of which may require substantial expenditures or limit our ability to offer some of our services additionally changes in these laws including newly released interpretations of these laws by courts and regulatory bodies may limit our data access use and disclosure and may require increased expenditures by us or may dictate that we not offer certain types of services any of the foregoing may have a material adverse impact on our ability to provide services to our clients or maintain our profitability

there is ongoing concern from privacy advocates regulators and others regarding data protection and privacy issues and the number of jurisdictions with data protection and privacy laws has been increasing also there are ongoing public policy discussions regarding whether the standards for deidentified anonymous or pseudonymized health information are sufficient and the risk of reidentification sufficiently small to adequately protect patient privacy these discussions may lead to further restrictions on the use of such information there can be no assurance that these initiatives or future initiatives will not adversely affect our ability to access and use data or to develop or market current or future services 

data protection privacy and similar laws protect more than patient information and although they vary by jurisdiction these laws can extend to employee information business contact information provider information and other information relating to identifiable individuals failure to comply with these laws may result in among other things civil and criminal liability negative publicity damage to our reputation and liability under contractual provisions in addition compliance with such laws may require increased costs to us or may dictate that we not offer certain types of services 

the occurrence of any of the foregoing could impact our ability to provide the same level of service to our clients require us to modify our offerings or increase our costs which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition

our success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 

our success depends in part upon our ability to develop use and protect our proprietary methodologies analytics systems technologies and other intellectual property existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights and the protection in some countries may be very limited we rely upon a combination of trade secrets confidentiality policies nondisclosure invention assignment and other contractual arrangements and patent copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights these laws are subject to change at any time and certain agreements may not be fully enforceable which could further restrict our ability to protect our innovations our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing services similar to or duplicative of ours further the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors former employees or other third parties and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 

 

our ability to obtain protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation or thirdparty opposition risks as well as the uncertainty as to the scope of protection registrability patentability validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights in each applicable country governments may adopt regulations and government agencies or courts may render decisions requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property rights when we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights we may be subject to claims that the intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our confidential and proprietary information litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly time consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property rights furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management’s attention and resources could delay further sales or the implementation of our solutions impair the functionality of our solutions delay introductions of new solutions result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our solutions or injure our reputation and harm our operating results and financial condition 

the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could reduce the differentiation of our services and harm our business the value of our investment in development or business acquisitions could be reduced and third parties might make claims against us related to losses of their confidential or proprietary information in addition we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights these incidents and claims could harm our business reduce revenue increase expenses and harm our reputation 

we may be subject to claims by others that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights 

third parties may assert claims that we or our clients infringe their intellectual property rights and these claims with or without merit could be expensive to litigate cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management resources and attention in defending the claim in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can also seek injunctive relief that may limit the operation of our business or prevent the marketing and selling of our services that infringe on the plaintiff’s intellectual property rights to resolve these claims we may enter into licensing agreements with restrictive terms or significant fees stop selling be required to implement costly redesigns to the affected services or pay damages to satisfy contractual obligations to others if we do not resolve these claims in advance of a trial there is no guarantee that we will be successful in court these outcomes may have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition certain contracts with our suppliers or clients contain provisions whereby we indemnify subject to certain limitations the counterparty for damages suffered as a result of claims related to intellectual property infringement and the use of data claims made under these provisions could be expensive to litigate and could result in significant payments 

  we rely on licenses from third parties to certain technology and intellectual property rights for some of our services and the licenses we currently have could terminate or expire 

some of our business services rely on technology or intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others our licenses to this technology or these intellectual property rights could be terminated or could expire we may be unable to replace these licenses in a timely manner failure to renew these licenses or renewals of these licenses on less advantageous terms could harm our operating results and financial condition 

our financial results may be adversely affected if we underprice our contracts overrun our cost estimates or fail to receive approval for or experience delays in documenting change orders 

most of our research  development solutions contracts are either fee for service contracts or fixedfee contracts our past financial results have been and our future financial results may be adversely impacted if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates and are unable to successfully negotiate a change order change orders typically occur when the scope of work we perform needs to be modified from that originally contemplated by our contract with the client modifications can occur for example when there is a change in a key clinical trial assumption or parameter or a significant change in timing where we are not successful in converting outofscope work into change orders under our current contracts we bear the cost of the additional work such underpricing significant cost overruns or delay in documentation of change orders could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

 

the relationship of backlog to revenues varies over time 

backlog represents future revenues for our research  development solutions business from work not yet completed or performed under signed binding commitments and signed contracts once work begins on a project revenue is recognized over the duration of the project projects may be terminated or delayed by the client or delayed by regulatory authorities for reasons beyond our control to the extent projects are delayed the timing of our revenue could be affected in the event that a client cancels a contract we typically would be entitled to receive payment for all services performed up to the cancellation date and subsequent clientauthorized services related to terminating the canceled project typically however we have no contractual right to the full amount of the revenue reflected in our backlog in the event of a contract cancellation the duration of the projects included in our backlog and the related revenue recognition range from a few weeks to many years our backlog may not be indicative of our future revenues from our research  development solutions business and we may not realize all the anticipated future revenue reflected in our backlog a number of factors may affect backlog including 









although an increase in backlog will generally result in an increase in revenues to be recognized over time depending on the level of cancellations an increase in backlog at a particular point in time does not necessarily correspond directly to an increase in revenues during a particular period the extent to which contracts in backlog will result in revenue depends on many factors including but not limited to delivery against projected schedules the need for scope changes change orders contract cancellations and the nature duration size complexity and phase of the contracts each of which factors can vary significantly from time to time 

the rate at which our backlog converts to revenue may vary over time for a variety of reasons the revenue recognition on larger more global projects could be slower than on smaller less global projects for a variety of reasons including but not limited to an extended period of negotiation between the time the project is awarded to us and the actual execution of the contract as well as an increased timeframe for obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals additionally the increased complexity of clinical trials and the need to enroll precise patient populations could extend the length of clinical trials causing revenue to be recognized over a longer period of time further delayed projects will remain in backlog unless otherwise canceled by the client and will not generate revenue at the rate originally expected thus the relationship of backlog to realized revenues may vary over time

our business depends on the continued effectiveness and availability of our information systems including the information systems we use to provide our services to our clients and failures of these systems may materially limit our operations 

due to the global nature of our business and our reliance on information systems to provide our services we intend to increase our use of webenabled and other integrated information systems in delivering our services we also provide access to similar information systems to certain of our clients in connection with the services we provide them as the breadth and complexity of our information systems continue to grow we will increasingly be exposed to the risks inherent in the development integration and ongoing operation of evolving information systems including 







 

the materialization of any of these risks may impede the processing of data the delivery of databases and services and the daytoday management of our business and could result in the corruption loss or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary confidential or other data while we have disaster recovery plans in place they might not adequately protect us in the event of a system failure while many of our operations have disaster recovery plans in place we currently do not have excess or standby computer processing or network capacity everywhere in the world to avoid disruption in the receipt processing and delivery of data in the event of a system failure despite any precautions we take damage from fire floods hurricanes power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses breakins and similar events at our various computer facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to our servers and from our servers to our clients corruption or loss of data may result in the need to repeat a clinical trial at no cost to the client but at significant cost to us the termination of a contract or damage to our reputation 

in addition any failure by our computer environment to provide sufficient processing or network capacity to transfer data could result in interruptions in our service in the event of a delay in the delivery of data we could be required to transfer our data collection operations to an alternative provider of server hosting services such a transfer could result in significant delays in our ability to deliver services to our clients and increase our costs additionally significant delays in system enhancements or inadequate performance of new or upgraded systems once completed could damage our reputation and harm our business finally longterm disruptions in the infrastructure caused by events such as natural disasters the outbreak of war the escalation of hostilities and acts of terrorism particularly involving cities in which we have offices could adversely affect our businesses although we carry property and business interruption insurance our coverage might not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur 

we have continued to undertake significant programs to optimize business processes with respect to our services our inability to effectively manage the implementation and adapt to new processes designed into new or upgraded systems in a timely and costeffective manner may result in disruption to our business and negatively affect our operations 

we have entered into agreements with certain vendors to provide systems development and integration services that develop or license to us the it platform for programs to optimize our business processes if such vendors fail to perform as required or if there are substantial delays in developing implementing and updating the it platform our client delivery may be impaired and we may have to make substantial further investments internally or with third parties to achieve our objectives additionally our progress may be limited by parties with existing or claimed patents who seek to enjoin us from using preferred technology or seek license payments from us meeting our objectives is dependent on a number of factors which may not take place as we anticipate including obtaining adequate technologyenabled services creating itenabled services that our clients will find desirable and implementing our business model with respect to these services also increased itrelated expenditures may negatively impact our profitability 

we may experience challenges with the acquisition development enhancement or deployment of technology necessary for our business 

we operate in businesses that require sophisticated computer systems and software for data collection data processing cloudbased platforms analytics cryptography statistical projections and forecasting mobile computing social media analytics and other applications and technologies particularly in our technology  analytics solutions and research  development solutions businesses we seek to address our technology risks by increasing our reliance on the use of innovations by crossindustry technology leaders and adapt these for our biopharmaceutical and healthcare industry clients some of these technologies supporting the industries we serve are changing rapidly and we must continue to adapt to these changes in a timely and effective manner at an acceptable cost we also must continue to deliver data to our clients in forms that are easy to use while simultaneously providing clear answers to complex questions there can be no guarantee that we will be able to develop acquire or integrate new technologies that these new technologies will meet our clients’ needs or achieve expected investment goals or that we will be able to do so as quickly or costeffectively as our competitors significant technological change could render certain of our services obsolete moreover the introduction of new services embodying new technologies could render certain of our existing services obsolete our continued success will depend on our ability to adapt to changing technologies manage and process everincreasing amounts of data and information and improve the performance features and reliability of our services in response to changing client and industry demands we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful design development testing introduction or marketing of our services new services or enhancements to existing services may not adequately meet the requirements of current and prospective clients or achieve any degree of significant market acceptance these types of failures could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

 

consolidation in the industries in which our clients operate may reduce the volume of services purchased by consolidated clients following an acquisition or merger which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 

mergers or consolidations among our clients have in the past and could in the future reduce the number of our clients and potential clients when companies consolidate overlapping services previously purchased separately are usually purchased only once by the combined entity leading to loss of revenue other services that were previously purchased by one of the merged or consolidated entities may be deemed unnecessary or cancelled if our clients merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services there can be no assurance as to the degree to which we may be able to address the revenue impact of such consolidation any of these developments could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by client or therapeutic concentration 

although we did not have any client that represented 10 or more of our revenues in 2018 2017 and 2016 we derive the majority of our revenues from a number of large clients if any large client decreases or terminates its relationship with us our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

additionally conducting multiple clinical trials for different clients in a single therapeutic class involving drugs with the same or similar chemical action has in the past and may in the future adversely affect our business if some or all of the clinical trials are canceled because of new scientific information or regulatory judgments that affect the drugs as a class or if industry consolidation results in the rationalization of drug development pipelines similarly marketing and selling drugs for different biopharmaceutical companies with similar chemical actions subjects us to risk if new scientific information or regulatory judgment prejudices the drugs as a class which may lead to compelled or voluntary prescription limitations or withdrawal of some or all of such drugs from the market 

our business is subject to international economic political and other risks that could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we have significant operations in countries that may require complex arrangements to deliver services throughout the world for our clients additionally we have established operations in locations remote from our most developed business centers as a result we are subject to heightened risks inherent in conducting business internationally including the following 











 











these risks and uncertainties could negatively impact our ability to among other things perform large global projects for our clients furthermore our ability to deal with these issues could be affected by applicable united states laws and the need to protect our assets any such risks could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

exchange rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial condition 

because a large portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar and our financial statements are reported in united states dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition exchange rate fluctuations between local currencies and the united states dollar create risk in several ways including 





we may limit these risks through exchange rate fluctuation provisions stated in our service contracts or we may hedge our transaction risk with foreign currency exchange contracts or options we have not however hedged all of our foreign currency transaction risk and we may experience fluctuations in financial results from our operations outside the united states and foreign currency transaction risk associated with our service contracts 

 

due to the global nature of our business we may be exposed to liabilities under anticorruption laws including the united states foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and various international anticorruption laws and any allegation or determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are required to comply with the fcpa the uk bribery act and other international anticorruption laws which prohibit companies from engaging in bribery including corruptly or improperly offering promising or providing money or anything else of value to nonunited states officials and certain other recipients in addition the fcpa imposes certain books records and accounting control obligations on public companies and other issuers we operate in parts of the world in which corruption can be common and compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices our global operations face the risk of unauthorized payments or offers being made by employees consultants sales agents and other business partners outside of our control or without our authorization it is our policy to implement safeguards to prohibit these practices by our employees and business partners with respect to our operations however irrespective of these safeguards or as a result of monitoring compliance with such safeguards it is possible that we or certain other parties may discover or receive information at some point that certain employees consultants sales agents or other business partners may have engaged in corrupt conduct for which we might be held responsible violations of the fcpa the uk bribery act or other international anticorruption laws may result in restatements of or irregularities in our financial statements as well as severe criminal or civil sanctions and we may be subject to other liabilities which could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition in some cases companies that violate the fcpa may be debarred by the united states government andor lose their united states export privileges changes in anticorruption laws or enforcement priorities could also result in increased compliance requirements and related costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition the united states or other governments may seek to hold us liable for successor liability fcpa violations or violations of other anticorruption laws committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquired or will acquire 

we face risks related to sales to government entities 

we derive a portion of our revenue from sales to government entities in the united states in general our contracts with united states government entities are terminable at will by the government entity at any time government demand and payment for our services may be affected by publicsector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations including government shutdowns government contracts are subject to oversight including special rules on accounting expenses reviews and security failure to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions including termination of contracts fines and suspensions or debarment from future business with the united states government as a result failure to comply with these rules could have an adverse effect on our future business reputation operating results and financial condition 

if we are unable to successfully develop and market new services or enter new markets our growth results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

a key element of our growth strategy is the successful development and marketing of new services or entering new markets that complement or expand our existing business as we develop new services or enter new markets including services targeted at participants in the broader healthcare industry we may not have or adequately build the competencies necessary to perform such services satisfactorily may not receive market acceptance for such services or may face increased competition if we are unable to succeed in developing new services entering new markets or attracting a client base for our new services or in new markets we will be unable to implement this element of our growth strategy and our future business reputation results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our research  development solutions business could subject us to potential liability that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our research  development solutions business involves the testing of new drugs on patients in clinical trials and if marketing approval is granted the availability of these drugs to be prescribed to patients our involvement in the clinical trials and development process creates a risk of liability for personal injury to or death of patients particularly those with lifethreatening illnesses resulting from adverse reactions to the drugs administered during testing or after product launch respectively for example we have from time to time been sued and may be sued in the future by individuals alleging personal injury due to their participation in clinical trials and seeking damages from us under a variety of legal theories although we maintain the types and amounts of insurance we view as customary in the industries and countries in which we operate if we are required to pay damages or incur defense costs in connection with any personal injury claim that is outside the scope of indemnification agreements we have with our clients if any indemnification agreement is not performed in accordance with its terms or if our liability exceeds the amount of any applicable indemnification limits or available insurance coverage our financial condition results of operations and reputation could be materially and adversely affected we maintain professional liability insurance including liability for completed operations coverage in the future we may not be able to get adequate insurance for these types of risks at reasonable rates 

 

we also contract with physicians to serve as investigators in conducting clinical trials if the investigators commit errors or make omissions during a clinical trial that result in harm to clinical trial patients or after a clinical trial to a patient using the drug after it has received regulatory approval claims for personal injury or liability damages may result additionally if the investigators engage in fraudulent behavior clinical trial data may be compromised which may require us to repeat the clinical trial or subject us to liability we do not believe we are legally responsible for the medical care rendered by such thirdparty investigators and we would vigorously defend any claims brought against us however it is possible we could be found liable for claims with respect to the actions of thirdparty investigators which may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

some of our services involve direct interaction with clinical trial subjects or volunteers and subcontracting into a network of phase i clinical facilities which could create potential liability that may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and reputation 

we subcontract into a network of facilities where phase i clinical trials are conducted which ordinarily involve testing an investigational drug on a limited number of healthy individuals typically 20 to 80 persons to determine such drug’s basic safety failure to operate such a facility in accordance with applicable regulations could result in that facility being shut down which could disrupt our operations additionally we face risks associated with adverse events resulting from the administration of such drugs to healthy volunteers and the professional malpractice of medical care providers any professional malpractice or negligence by such investigators nurses or other subcontracted employees could potentially result in liability to us in the event of personal injury to or death of a healthy volunteer in clinical trials and could also cause us reputational harm this liability particularly if it were to exceed the limits of any indemnification agreements and insurance coverage we may have may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation

our contract sales  medical solutions business could result in liability to us if a drug causes harm to a patient while we are generally indemnified and insured against such risks we may still suffer financial losses 

when we market drugs under contract for a biopharmaceutical company we could suffer liability for harm allegedly caused by those drugs either as a result of a lawsuit against the biopharmaceutical company to which we are joined a lawsuit naming us or any of our subsidiaries or an action launched by a regulatory body while we are generally indemnified by the biopharmaceutical company for the action of the drugs we market on its behalf and we carry insurance to cover harm caused by our negligence in performing services it is possible that we could nonetheless incur financial losses regulatory penalties or both in particular any claim could result in potential liability for us if the claim is outside the scope of the indemnification agreement we have with the biopharmaceutical company the biopharmaceutical company does not abide by the indemnification agreement as required or the liability exceeds the amount of any applicable indemnification limits or available insurance coverage such a finding could have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and reputation furthermore negative publicity associated with harm caused by drugs we helped to market could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

our insurance may not cover all of our indemnification obligations and other liabilities associated with our operations 

we maintain insurance designed to provide coverage for ordinary risks associated with our operations and our ordinary indemnification obligations the coverage provided by such insurance may not be adequate for all claims we may make or may be contested by our insurance carriers if our insurance is not adequate or available to pay liabilities associated with our operations or if we are unable to purchase adequate insurance at reasonable rates in the future our profitability may be adversely impacted 

if we are unable to attract suitable investigators and patients for our clinical trials our clinical development business might suffer 

the timely recruitment of investigators and patients for clinical trials is essential to our research  development solutions business investigators are typically located at hospitals clinics or other sites and supervise the administration of the investigational drug to patients during the course of a clinical trial patients generally include people from the communities in which the clinical trials are conducted our clinical development business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract suitable and willing investigators or patients for clinical trials on a consistent basis for example if we are unable to engage investigators to conduct clinical trials as planned or enroll sufficient patients in clinical trials we might need to expend additional funds to obtain access to resources or else be compelled to delay or modify the clinical trial plans which may result in additional costs to us 

 

if we lose the services of key personnel or are unable to recruit additional qualified personnel our business could be adversely affected 

our success substantially depends on the collective performance contributions and expertise of our personnel including senior management and key personnel qualified professional scientific and technical operating staff and qualified sales representatives for our contract sales services there is significant and increasing competition for qualified personnel particularly those with higher educational degrees such as a medical degree a phd or an equivalent degree or relevant experience in the industry and in the locations in which we operate in addition the departure of our key employees or our inability to continue to identify attract and retain qualified personnel or replace any departed personnel in a timely fashion may impact our ability to grow our business and compete effectively in our industry and may negatively affect our ability to meet financial and operational goals 

disruptions in the credit and capital markets and unfavorable general economic conditions could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

disruptions in the credit and capital markets could have negative effects on our business that may be difficult to predict or anticipate including the ability of our clients vendors contractors and financing sources to meet their contractual obligations although we are unable to quantify the impact it has had on us we are aware of a limited number of instances in our research  development solutions business during the past several years where cancellations changes in scope and failure to pay timely were attributable at least in part to difficulty in our clients’ ability to obtain financing in the future such actions by our clients could if they involve a significant amount of business with us have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our effective income tax rate may fluctuate for a variety of reasons including the tax cuts and jobs act enacted in 2017 the “tax act” which may adversely affect our operations earnings and earnings per share 

our effective income tax rate is influenced by our projected profitability in the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate changes in a jurisdiction’s income tax rates and the distribution of our profits and losses among such jurisdictions may have a significant impact on our effective income tax rate which in turn could have an adverse effect on our net income and earnings per share factors that may affect our effective income tax rate include but are not limited to 















in addition our effective income tax rate is influenced by us tax law which has been substantially modified by the tax act currently regulations have been issued in proposed form and if the application of these provisions are modified to change the interpretation to us it could have an adverse impact on our effective income tax rate









 

all of these items described above may cause fluctuations in our effective income tax rate through increased us tax liability andor the loss of tax attributes in any given year that could adversely affect our results of operations and impact our earnings and earnings per share additional information regarding our income taxes is presented in note 16 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” including asc 606 “revenue from contracts with customers” asc 606 or other standardsetting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements

we are required to prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” which is periodically revised andor expanded from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the fasb and the sec it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt such as amended guidance for leases may require additional changes to the current accounting treatment that we apply to our financial statements and may require us to make significant changes to our reporting systems such changes could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition

for example effective january 1 2018 we were required to adopt asc 606 under this new standard the company is required to recognize revenue for its clinical trial arrangements on a percentage of completion basis this change in revenue recognition requires significant estimates of project costs that will need to be updated and adjusted on a regular basis these updates and adjustments are likely to result in variability in our revenue recognition from period to period that may cause unexpected variability in our operating results see note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for details regarding asc 606 

our relationships with existing or potential clients who are in competition with each other may adversely impact the degree to which other clients or potential clients use our services which may adversely affect our results of operations 

the biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive with biopharmaceutical companies each seeking to persuade payers providers and patients that their drug therapies are better and more costeffective than competing therapies marketed or being developed by competing firms in addition to the adverse competitive interests that biopharmaceutical companies have with each other biopharmaceutical companies also have adverse interests with respect to drug selection and reimbursement with other participants in the healthcare industry including payers and providers biopharmaceutical companies also compete to be first to market with new drug therapies we regularly provide services to biopharmaceutical companies who compete with each other and we sometimes provide services or funding to such clients regarding competing drugs in development our existing or future relationships with our biopharmaceutical clients may therefore deter other biopharmaceutical clients from using our services or may result in our clients seeking to place limits on our ability to serve other biopharmaceutical industry participants in connection with drug development activities in addition our further expansion into the broader healthcare market may adversely impact our relationships with biopharmaceutical clients and such clients may elect not to use our services reduce the scope of services that we provide to them or seek to place restrictions on our ability to serve clients in the broader healthcare market with interests that are adverse to theirs a loss of clients or reductions in the level of revenues from a client could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations business and prospects 

if we are unable to successfully identify acquire and integrate existing businesses services and technologies our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 

we anticipate that a portion of our future growth may come from acquiring existing businesses services or technologies the success of any acquisition will depend upon among other things our ability to effectively integrate acquired personnel operations services and technologies into our business and to retain the key personnel and clients of our acquired businesses in addition we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or obtain any necessary financing on commercially acceptable terms we may also spend time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition targets but not complete the transaction any future acquisition could involve other risks including among others the assumption of additional liabilities and expenses difficulties and expenses in connection with integrating the acquired companies and achieving the expected benefits issuances of potentially dilutive securities or interestbearing debt loss of key employees of the acquired companies transaction costs diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and with respect to the acquisition of foreign companies the inability to overcome differences in foreign business practices language and customs our failure to identify potential acquisitions complete targeted acquisitions and integrate completed acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

investments in our clients’ businesses or drugs and our related commercial rights strategies could have a negative impact on our financial performance 

we may enter into arrangements with our clients or other drug companies in which we take on some of the risk of the potential success or failure of their businesses or drugs including making strategic investments in our clients or other drug companies providing financing to clients or other drug companies or acquiring an interest in the revenues from clients’ drugs or in entities developing a limited number of drugs our financial results would be adversely affected if these investments or the underlying drugs result in losses or do not achieve the level of success that we anticipate andor our return or payment from the drug investment or financing is less than our direct and indirect costs with respect to these arrangements 

  our results of operations may be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our goodwill and intangible assets 

we assess the realizability of our indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill annually and conduct an interim evaluation whenever events or changes in circumstances such as operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset indicate that these assets may be impaired for example we recognized 40 million of impairment losses during the year ended december 31 2017 for goodwill and intangible assets in encore health resources llc “encore” which we sold in the third quarter of 2017 our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of the businesses we have acquired which in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses into our own business if we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets such impairment charges could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we face risks arising from the restructuring of our operations 

from time to time we have adopted restructuring plans to improve our operating efficiency through various means such as reduction of overcapacity elimination of nonbillable support roles or other realignment of resources restructuring presents significant potential risks of events occurring that could adversely affect us including 











further any such restructuring would result in charges that if material could harm our results of operations and significantly reduce our cash position or increase debt in addition we may incur certain unforeseen costs once any restructuring activities are implemented further if we determine to effect any restructuring we can give no assurance that any projected cost reductions resulting from such restructuring activities will be achieved within the expected timeframe or at all 

because of these and other factors we cannot predict whether we will realize the purpose and anticipated benefits of these measures and if we do not our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

additionally there may be delays in implementing the restructuring activities or a failure to achieve the anticipated levels of cost savings and efficiency as a result of the restructuring activities each of which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations further restructuring or reorganization activities may also be required in the future beyond what is currently planned which could further enhance the risks associated with these activities 

 

risks relating to our industry 

the biopharmaceutical services industry is highly competitive 

the biopharmaceutical services industry is highly competitive our business often competes with other biopharmaceutical services companies internal discovery departments development departments sales and marketing departments information technology departments and other departments within our clients some of which could be considered large biopharmaceutical services companies in their own right with greater resources than ours we also compete with universities teaching hospitals governments agencies and others if we do not compete successfully our business will suffer the industry is highly fragmented with numerous smaller specialized companies and a handful of companies with global capabilities similar to certain of our own capabilities increased competition has led to price and other forms of competition such as acceptance of less favorable contract terms that could adversely affect our operating results there are few barriers to entry for companies considering offering any one or more of the services we offer because of their size and focus these companies might compete effectively against us which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our future growth and success will depend on our ability to successfully compete with other companies that provide similar services in the same markets some of which may have financial marketing technical and other advantages we also expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of consolidation among these various companies large technology companies with substantial resources technical expertise and greater brand power could also decide to enter or further expand in the markets where our business operates and compete with us if one or more of our competitors or potential competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors or if a new entrant emerged with substantial resources the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively we compete on the basis of various factors including breadth and depth of services reputation reliability quality innovation security price and industry expertise and experience in addition our ability to compete successfully may be impacted by the growing availability of health information from social media government health information systems and other free or lowcost sources consolidation or integration of wholesalers retail pharmacies health networks payers or other healthcare stakeholders may lead any of them to provide information services directly to clients or indirectly through a designated service provider resulting in increased competition from firms that may have lower costs to market eg no data supply costs any of the above may result in lower demand for our services which could result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

outsourcing trends in the biopharmaceutical industry and changes in aggregate spending and research and development budgets could adversely affect our operating results and growth rate 

economic factors and industry trends that affect biopharmaceutical companies affect our research  development solutions business biopharmaceutical companies continue to seek longterm strategic collaborations with global contract research organizations with favorable pricing terms competition for these collaborations is intense and we may decide to forego an opportunity or we may not be selected in which case a competitor may enter into the collaboration and our business with the client if any may be limited in addition if the biopharmaceutical industry reduces its research  development solutions activities or reduces its outsourcing of clinical trials and sales and marketing projects or such outsourcing fails to grow at projected rates our operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected we may also be negatively impacted by consolidation and other factors in the biopharmaceutical industry which may slow decision making by our clients or result in the delay or cancellation of clinical trials our commercial services may be affected by reductions in new drug launches and increases in the number of drugs losing patent protection all of these events could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our business may be materially and adversely impacted by factors affecting the biopharmaceutical and healthcare industries 

the vast majority of our revenue is generated from sales to the biopharmaceutical and healthcare industries the clients we serve in these industries are commonly subject to financial pressures including but not limited to increased costs reduced demand for their products reductions in pricing and reimbursement for products and services formulary approval and placement government approval to market their products and limits on the manner by which they market their products loss of patent exclusivity whether due to patent expiration or as a result of a successful legal challenge and the proliferation of or changes to regulations applicable to these industries to the extent our clients face such pressures or they change how they utilize our offerings the demand for our services or the prices our clients are willing to pay for those services may decline any such decline could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 

we may be affected by healthcare reform and potential additional reforms 

the united states congress continues to consider healthcare reform legislation and impose health industry cost containment measures which may significantly impact the biopharmaceutical industry in addition numerous government bodies are considering or have adopted various healthcare reforms and may undertake or are in the process of undertaking efforts to control growing healthcare costs through legislation regulation and voluntary agreements with medical care providers and biopharmaceutical companies we are uncertain as to the effects of these recent reforms on our business and are unable to predict what legislative proposals if any will be adopted in the future if regulatory cost containment efforts limit the profitability of new drugs our clients may reduce their research and development spending or promotional marketing and sales expenditures which could reduce the business they outsource to us similarly if regulatory requirements are relaxed or simplified drug approval procedures are adopted the demand for our services could decrease 

foreign and domestic government bodies may also adopt healthcare legislation or regulations that are more burdensome than existing regulations for example product safety concerns and recommendations by the drug safety oversight board could change the regulatory environment for drug products and new or heightened regulatory and licensing requirements may increase our expenses or limit or delay our ability to offer some of our services additionally new or heightened regulatory requirements may have a negative impact on the ability of our clients to conduct industrysponsored clinical trials which could reduce the need for our services 

actions by government regulators or clients to limit a prescription’s scope or withdraw an approved drug from the market could adversely affect our business and result in a loss of revenues 

government regulators have the authority after approving a drug to regulate or limit its scope of prescription or withdraw it from the market completely based on safety concerns similarly clients may act to voluntarily limit the scope of prescription of drugs or withdraw them from the market in the past we have provided services with respect to drugs that have been limited andor withdrawn if we are providing services to clients for drugs that are limited or withdrawn we may be required to narrow the scope of or terminate our services with respect to such drugs which would prevent earning the full amount of revenues anticipated under the related service contracts with negative impacts to our financial results 

if we do not keep pace with rapid technological changes our services may become less competitive or obsolete 

the biopharmaceutical industry is subject to rapid technological changes our current competitors or other businesses might develop technologies or services that are more effective or commercially attractive than or render obsolete our current or future technologies and services if our competitors introduce superior technologies or services including in the provision of clinical services and if we cannot make enhancements to remain competitive our competitive position would be harmed if we are unable to compete successfully we may lose clients or be unable to attract new clients which could lead to a decrease in our revenue and financial condition 

laws restricting biopharmaceutical sales and marketing practices may adversely impact demand for our services 

there have been a significant number of laws legislative initiatives and regulatory actions over the years that seek to limit biopharmaceutical sales and marketing practices for example three states in 2006 and 2007 passed laws restricting the use of prescriber identifiable information for the purpose of promoting branded prescription medicines although these laws were subsequently declared to be unconstitutional based on a decision of the us supreme court in sorrell v ims health in 2011 we are unable to predict whether and in what form other initiatives may be introduced or actions taken at the state or federal levels to limit biopharmaceutical sales and marketing practices in addition while we will continue to seek to adapt our services to comply with the requirements of these laws to the extent applicable to our services if enacted there can be no assurance that our efforts to adapt our offerings will be successful and provide the same financial contribution to us there can also be no assurance that future legislative initiatives will not adversely affect our ability to develop or market current or future offerings or that any future laws will not diminish the demand for our services all of which could over time result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

 

our research  development solutions clients face intense competition from lower cost generic products which may lower the amount that they spend on our services 

our research  development solutions clients face increasing competition from lower cost generic products which in turn may affect their ability to pursue research and development activities with us in the united states eu and japan political pressure to reduce spending on prescription drugs has led to legislation and other measures which encourages the use of generic products in addition proposals emerge from time to time in the united states and other countries for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by generic substitutes reducing our clients’ sales of that product and their overall profitability availability of generic substitutes for our clients’ drugs may adversely affect their results of operations and cash flow which in turn may mean that they would not have surplus capital to invest in research and development and drug commercialization including in our services if competition from generic products impacts our clients’ finances such that they decide to curtail our services our revenues may decline and this could have a material adverse effect on our business 

risks relating to our indebtedness 

restrictions imposed in the senior secured credit facilities and other outstanding indebtedness including the indentures governing iqvia holdings inc outstanding notes may limit our ability to operate our business and to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 

the terms of the senior secured credit facilities as defined below restrict iqvia and its restricted subsidiaries from engaging in specified types of transactions these covenants restrict the ability of iqvia and its restricted subsidiaries among other things to 

























in addition the revolving credit facility and the term a and b loans under our credit agreement as defined below require iqvia to comply with a quarterly maximum senior secured net leverage ratio test and minimum interest coverage ratio test iqvia’s ability to comply with these financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and iqvia may not be able to satisfy them additionally the restrictions contained in the indentures governing the outstanding notes could also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions meet capital needs or make acquisitions or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans 

 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facilities or the indentures governing the outstanding notes which could trigger acceleration of our indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of or default under any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial results in the event of any default under the senior secured credit facilities the applicable lenders could elect to terminate borrowing commitments and declare all borrowings and loans outstanding together with accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and other obligations to be due and payable in addition or in the alternative the applicable lenders could exercise their rights under the security documents entered into in connection with the senior secured credit facilities iqvia and the other subsidiary guarantors have pledged substantially all of their tangible and intangible assets subject to customary exceptions as collateral under the senior secured credit facilities including the stock and the assets of certain of our current and future wholly owned united states subsidiaries and a portion of the stock of certain of our nonunited states subsidiaries 

if we were unable to repay or otherwise refinance these borrowings and loans when due the applicable lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation in the event the applicable lenders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness any acceleration of amounts due under the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities or the exercise by the applicable lenders of their rights under the security documents would likely have a material adverse effect on us 

despite our level of indebtedness we are able to incur more debt and undertake additional obligations incurring such debt or undertaking such additional obligations could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition 

although our credit agreement which governs the senior secured credit facilities of our wholly owned subsidiary through which we conduct our operations iqvia inc contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could increase in addition the receivables financing facility for our special purpose subsidiary iqvia funding llc “iqvia funding” limits borrowing based on the amount of receivables purchased by iqvia funding from certain of our other subsidiaries but when supported by the value of such purchased receivables the debt under our receivables financing facility can increase 

while the credit agreement also contains restrictions on our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to make loans and investments these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the investments incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 

restrictive covenants in our other indebtedness may limit our flexibility in our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to pursue our business strategies 

the terms contained in certain of our indebtedness including credit facilities and any future indebtedness of ours may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions including restrictions on our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to take actions that we believe may be in our interest these agreements among other things limit our ability to 





















 





a breach of the covenants or restrictions under the agreements governing our other indebtedness could result in a default under the applicable indebtedness such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in the event our lenders and noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we cannot assure that we and our subsidiaries would have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness 

our financial results our substantial indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of future financing 

interest rate fluctuations and our ability to deduct interest expense may affect our results of operations and financial condition 

because we have variable rate debt fluctuations in interest rates affect our business we attempt to minimize interest rate risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate caps and swaps we have entered into interest rate caps and swaps with financial institutions that have reset dates and critical terms that match those of our senior secured term loan credit facility accordingly any change in market value associated with the interest rate caps and swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt because we do not attempt to hedge all of our variable rate debt we may incur higher interest costs for the portion of our variable rate debt which is not hedged 

in addition the deduction for our interest expense may be limited which could have an adverse impact on our taxes and net income 

risks relating to ownership of our common stock 

provisions of the corporate governance documents of iqvia could make an acquisition of iqvia difficult and may prevent attempts by its stockholders to replace or remove its management even if beneficial to its stockholders 

our certificate of incorporation and delaware bylaws and the general corporation law of delaware “dgcl” contain provisions that could make it difficult for a third party to acquire iqvia even if doing so might be beneficial to its stockholders including 















 

in addition iqvia is subject to section 203 of the dgcl regulating corporate takeovers although our board of directors adopted a resolution approving the merger pursuant to which shares of common stock were acquired by among others the tpg shareholders section 203 subject to certain exceptions prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any “business combination” with any “interested stockholder” for a period of three years following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder unless 







in general section 203 defines “business combination” to include mergers or consolidations between a delaware corporation and an interested stockholder transactions with an interested stockholder involving the assets or stock of the corporation or its majorityowned subsidiaries and transactions which increase an interested stockholder’s percentage ownership of stock in general section 203 defines an “interested stockholder” as any entity or person beneficially owning 15 or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by stockholders to replace members of the board of directors because iqvia’s board is responsible for appointing the members of management these provisions could in turn affect any attempt to replace current members of management as a result stockholders of iqvia may lose their ability to sell their stock for a price in excess of the prevailing market price due to these protective measures and efforts by stockholders to change the direction or management of iqvia may be unsuccessful 

our operating results and share price may be volatile which could cause the value of our stockholders’ investments to decline 

our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future and such fluctuations may be significant in addition securities markets worldwide have experienced and are likely to continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could subject the market price of our shares to wide price fluctuations regardless of our operating performance our operating results and the trading price of our shares may fluctuate in response to various factors including 





















 

these and other factors many of which are beyond our control may cause our operating results and the market price for our shares to fluctuate substantially while we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares and may otherwise negatively affect the market price and liquidity of our shares in addition in the past when the market price of a stock has been volatile holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock if any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation 

there may be sales of a substantial amount of our common stock by our current stockholders and these sales could cause the price of our common stock to fall 

as of february 12 2019 there were 197599861 shares of common stock outstanding approximately 109 of the outstanding shares of our common stock is held by parties to the shareholders agreement 

sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales will occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for us to raise funds through securities offerings in the future for example as restrictions on resale end the market price of our common stock could decline if the holders of currently restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them 

stockholders that are a party to the shareholders agreement may require us to register their shares for resale under the federal securities laws subject to certain requirements under the shareholders agreement we are required to pay the registration expenses associated with the registration of such shares not including the underwriting discounts commissions and transfer taxes registration of those shares would allow those stockholders to immediately resell their shares in the public market any such sales or the anticipation of such sales may cause the market price of our common stock to decline in 2018 the parties to the shareholders agreement sold approximately 214 million shares of our common stock of which we repurchased approximately 60 million shares 

in addition we may use our cash cash generated from operations or dispositions of assets or businesses andor proceeds from any new financing arrangements or issuances of debt or equity securities to repurchase shares including the repurchase of shares from our stockholders that are a party to the shareholders agreement 

since we have no current plans to pay regular cash dividends on our common stock stockholders may not receive any return on investment unless they sell their common stock for a price greater than that which they paid for it 

although we have previously declared dividends to our stockholders prior to our initial public offering in may 2013 we do not currently anticipate paying any regular cash dividends on our common stock any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board and will depend on among other things our results of operations financial condition cash requirements contractual restrictions and other factors that our board may deem relevant in addition our ability to pay dividends is and may be limited by covenants of existing and any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur including under our existing credit facilities therefore any return on investment in our common stock is solely dependent upon the appreciation of the price of our common stock on the open market which may not occur 

our certificate of incorporation contains a provision renouncing any interest and expectancy in certain corporate opportunities identified by certain of our affiliates even if such corporate opportunities are ones that we might reasonably be deemed to have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue 

our certificate of incorporation provides that our company renounces any interest or expectancy in the business opportunities of the tpg shareholders the bain capital cpp investment board private holdings inc “cpp shareholder” and leonard green  partners lp “lgp shareholders” and their affiliates other than our company and our subsidiaries and all of their respective partners principals directors officers members managers managing directors andor employees and each such person will have no obligation to offer us such opportunities this provision applies to these stockholders and associated parties only for so long as a nominee designated by the stockholder under the shareholders agreement continues to serve on the board stockholders are deemed to have notice of and have consented to this provision of our certificate of incorporation 

therefore a director or officer of our company who also serves as a director officer member manager or employee of such stockholders may pursue certain business opportunities including acquisitions that may be complementary to its business and as a result such opportunities may not be available to us these potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on the business financial condition results of operations or prospects of our company if attractive corporate opportunities are allocated by such stockholders to themselves or their other affiliates instead of to us 

 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

none 




 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2018 we had approximately 307 offices located in approximately 84 countries our executive headquarters are located adjacent to research triangle park north carolina and in danbury connecticut we own facilities in barcelona spain buenos aires argentina caracas venezuela los ruices venezuela lisbon portugal and bangalore india all of our other offices are leased our properties are geographically distributed to meet our worldwide operating requirements and none of our properties are individually material to our business operations many of our leases have an option to renew and we believe that we will be able to successfully renew expiring leases on terms satisfactory to us we believe that our facilities are adequate for our operations and that suitable additional space will be available if needed 




 item 3 legal proceedings

we are involved in a variety of legal and tax proceedings claims and litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business these actions may be commenced by various parties including competitors clients current or former employees government agencies or others we record a provision with respect to a proceeding claim or litigation when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated however even in instances where we have recorded an estimated liability we are unable to predict with certainty the final outcome of the matter or whether resolution of the matter will materially affect our operating results financial position or cash flows as additional information becomes available we adjust our assessment and estimates of such liabilities accordingly 

further we routinely enter into agreements with our suppliers to acquire data and with our clients to sell data all in the normal course of business in these agreements we sometimes agree to indemnify and hold harmless the other party for any damages such other party may suffer as a result of potential intellectual property infringement and other claims related to the use of the data we have not accrued liability with respect to these matters as the exposure is considered remote 

based on our review of the latest information available management does not expect the impact of pending legal and tax proceedings claims and litigation either individually or in the aggregate to have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial position or cash flows however one or more unfavorable outcomes in any claim or litigation against us could have a material adverse effect for the period in which it is resolved the following is a summary of the more significant legal matters involving the company 

our whollyowned subsidiary ims government solutions inc is primarily engaged in providing services under contracts with the united states government united states government contracts are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements and from time to time agencies of the united states government have the ability to investigate whether contractors’ operations are being conducted in accordance with such requirements ims government solutions discovered potential noncompliance with various contract clauses and requirements under its general services administration contract the “gsa contract” which was awarded in 2002 to its predecessor company synchronous knowledge inc synchronous knowledge inc was acquired by ims health in may 2005 the potential noncompliance arose from two primary areas first at the direction of the government work performed under one task order was invoiced under another task order without the appropriate modifications to the orders being made and second personnel who did not meet strict compliance with the labor categories component of the qualification requirements of the gsa contract were assigned to contracts upon discovery of the potential noncompliance we began remediation efforts promptly disclosed the potential noncompliance to the united states government and were accepted into the department of defense voluntary disclosure program we filed a voluntary disclosure program report on august 29 2008 we are currently unable to determine the outcome of all of these matters pending the resolution of the voluntary disclosure program process and the ultimate liability arising from these matters could exceed our current reserves 

 

on february 13 2014 a group of approximately 1200 medical doctors and 900 private individuals filed a civil lawsuit with the seoul central district court against ims korea and two other defendants kpa and the korean pharmaceutical information center “kpic” the civil lawsuit alleges kpa and kpic collected their personal information in violation of applicable privacy laws without the necessary consent through a software system installed on pharmacy computer systems in korea and that personal information was transferred to ims korea and sold to pharmaceutical companies on september 11 2017 the district court issued a final decision that the encryption in u se by the defendants since june 2014 was adequate to meet the requirements of the korean personal information privacy act “pipa” and the sharing of nonidentified information for market research pu rposes was allowed under pipa the district court also found an earlier version of encryption was insufficient to meet pipa requirements but no personal data had been leaked or reidentified the district court did not award any da mages to plaintiffs approximately 280 medical doctors and 200 private individuals appeale d the district court decision the company believes the appeal is without merit and intends to vigorously defend its position   

  on july 23 2015 indictments were issued by the seoul central district prosecutors’ office in south korea against 24 individuals and companies alleging improper handling of sensitive health information in violation of among others south korea’s personal information protection act ims korea and two of its employees were among the individuals and organizations indicted although there is no assertion that ims korea used patient identified health information in any of its offerings prosecutors allege that certain of ims korea’s data suppliers should have obtained patient consent when they converted sensitive patient information into nonidentified data and that ims korea had not taken adequate precautions to reduce the risk of reidentification we believe the indictment is without merit that we acted in compliance with all applicable laws at all times and intend to vigorously defend our position 

on january 10 2017 iqvia inc ims health incorporated and ims software services inc collectively “iqvia parties” filed a lawsuit in the us district court for the district of new jersey against veeva systems inc “veeva” alleging veeva unlawfully used iqvia parties intellectual property to improve veeva data offerings to promote and market veeva data offerings and to improve veeva technology offerings iqvia parties seek injunctive relief appointment of a monitor the award of compensatory and punitive damages and reimbursement of all litigation expenses including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs on march 13 2017 veeva filed counterclaims alleging anticompetitive business practices in violation of the sherman act and state laws veeva claims damages in excess of 200 million and is seeking punitive damages and litigation costs including attorneys’ fees we believe the counterclaims are without merit reject all counterclaims raised by veeva and intend to vigorously defend iqvia parties’ position and pursue our claims against veeva

purchases of equity securities by the issuer 

on october 30 2013 our board of directors the “board” approved an equity repurchase program the “repurchase program” authorizing the repurchase of up to 125 million of either our common stock or vested inthemoney employee stock options or a combination thereof our board increased the stock repurchase authorization under the repurchase program with respect to the repurchase of our common stock by 600 million 15 billion 2 billion and 15 billion in 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively which increased the total amount that has been authorized under the repurchase program to 5725 billion the repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any particular amount of common stock or vested inthemoney employee stock options and it may be modified extended suspended or discontinued at any time the timing and amount of repurchases are determined by our management based on a variety of factors such as the market price of our common stock our corporate requirements and overall market conditions purchases of our common stock may be made in open market transactions effected through a brokerdealer at prevailing market prices in block trades or in privately negotiated transactions we may also repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to a trading plan meeting the requirements of rule 10b51 under the exchange act which would permit shares of our common stock to be repurchased when we might otherwise be precluded from doing so by law repurchases of vested inthemoney employee stock options were made through transactions between us and our employees other than our executive officers who were not eligible to participate in the program and this aspect of the repurchase program expired in november 2013 the repurchase program for common stock does not have an expiration date 

from inception of the repurchase program through december 31 2018 we have repurchased a total of 5440 million of our securities under the repurchase program

during the year ended december 31 2018 we repurchased 126 million shares of our common stock at an average market price per share of 11123 for an aggregate purchase price of 1396 million under the repurchase program these amounts include 6 million shares of our common stock that we repurchased directly from underwriters in connection with two secondary public offerings of shares of our common stock held by certain of our sponsors for an aggregate purchase price of 659 million for additional information regarding our equity repurchases see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” and note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

as of december 31 2018 we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to 285 million of our common stock under the repurchase program in addition from time to time we have repurchased and may continue to repurchase common stock through private or other transactions outside of the repurchase program on february 13 2019 our board authorized an increase in the postmerger share repurchase authorization by 20 billion resulting in approximately 23 billion remaining authorization 

since the merger we have repurchased 564 million shares of our common stock at an average market price per share of 8912 for an aggregate purchase price of 5026 million this includes shares withheld from employees to satisfy certain tax obligations due in connection with grants of stock under the quintiles ims holdings inc 2017 incentive and stock award plan the “plan” the plan provides for the withholding of shares to satisfy tax obligations it does not specify a maximum number of shares that can be withheld for this purpose the shares of common stock withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations may be deemed to be “issuer purchases” of shares that are required to be disclosed pursuant to this item

sources of revenue 

total revenues are comprised of revenues from the provision of our services we do not have any material product revenues 

costs and expenses 

our costs and expenses are comprised primarily of our costs of revenue reimbursed expenses and selling general and administrative expenses costs of revenue include compensation and benefits for billable employees and personnel involved in production trial monitoring data management and delivery and the costs of acquiring and processing data for our information offerings costs of staff directly involved with delivering technologyrelated services offerings and engagements related accommodations and the costs of data purchased specifically for technology services engagements and other expenses directly related to service contracts such as courier fees laboratory supplies professional services and travel expenses as noted above reimbursed expenses are comprised principally of payments to investigators who oversee clinical trials and travel expenses for our clinical monitors and sales representatives selling general and administrative expenses include costs related to sales marketing and administrative functions including human resources legal finance quality assurance compliance and general management for compensation and benefits travel professional services training and expenses for information technology facilities and depreciation and amortization 

foreign currency translation

in 2018 approximately 40 of our revenues were denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar which represents approximately 55 currencies because a large portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar and our financial statements are reported in united states dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly affect our results of operations the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies and translated into united states dollars for financial reporting purposes accordingly exchange rate fluctuations will affect the translation of foreign results into united states dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated results as a result we believe that providing the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on certain financial results can facilitate the analysis of periodtoperiod comparisons of business performance that excludes the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations the constant currency information assumes the same foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect for the comparable prioryear period were used in translation of the current period results

research  development solutions 



backlog

research and development solutions contracted backlog was 1713 billion at december 31 2018 and we expect approximately 48 billion of this backlog to convert to revenue in the next 12 months contracted backlog was 1484 billion at december 31 2017 the december 31 2017 backlog amount has been updated to reflect the adoption of the new revenue standard

backlog represents at a particular point in time future revenues from work not yet completed or performed under signed contracts once work begins on a project revenues are recognized over the duration of the project backlog denominated in foreign currencies are valued each month using the actual average foreign exchange rates in effect during the month 

we believe that backlog may not be a consistent indicator of future revenues because backlog has been and likely will be affected by a number of factors including the variable size and duration of projects many of which are performed over several years cancellations and changes to the scope of work during the course of projects projects that have been delayed remain in backlog but the timing of the revenue generated may differ from the timing originally expected additionally projects may be terminated or delayed by the customer or delayed by regulatory authorities in the event that a client cancels a contract we typically would be entitled to receive payment for all services performed up to the cancellation date and subsequent clientauthorized services related to winding down the canceled project for more details regarding risks related to our backlog see part i item ia “risk factors—risks related to our business—the relationship of backlog to revenues varies over time”

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows in addition to operating cash flows other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include capital expenditures acquisitions investments debt service requirements dividends equity repurchases adequacy of our revolving credit and receivables financing facilities and access to the capital markets 

we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which those funds can be accessed on a costeffective basis the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences however those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations we have and expect to transfer cash from those subsidiaries to the united states and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so 

we had a cash balance of 891 million at december 31 2018 212 million of which was in the united states a decrease from 959 million at december 31 2017 

based on our current operating plan we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents future cash flows from operations and our ability to access funds under our revolving credit and receivables financing facilities will enable us to fund our operating requirements and capital expenditures and meet debt obligations for at least the next 12 months we regularly evaluate our debt arrangements as well as market conditions and from time to time we may explore opportunities to modify our existing debt arrangements or pursue additional financing arrangements that could result in the issuance of new debt securities by us or our affiliates we may use our existing cash cash generated from operations or dispositions of assets or businesses andor proceeds from any new financing arrangements or issuances of debt or equity securities to repay or reduce some of our outstanding obligations to repurchase shares from our stockholders or for other purposes as part of our ongoing business strategy we also continually evaluate new acquisition expansion and investment possibilities or other strategic growth opportunities as well as potential dispositions of assets or businesses as appropriate including dispositions that may cause us to recognize a loss on certain assets should we elect to pursue any such transaction we may seek to obtain debt or equity financing to facilitate those activities our ability to enter into any such potential transactions and our use of cash or proceeds is limited to varying degrees by the terms and restrictions contained in our existing debt arrangements we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to complete any such financing arrangements or other transactions on favorable terms or at all

receivables financing facility 

on december 5 2014 we entered into a fouryear arrangement to securitize certain of our accounts receivable under the receivables financing facility certain of our accounts receivable are sold on a nonrecourse basis by certain of our consolidated subsidiaries to another of our consolidated subsidiaries a bankruptcyremote special purpose entity “spe” the spe obtained a term loan and revolving loan commitment from a thirdparty lender secured by liens on the assets of the spe to finance the purchase of the accounts receivable which includes a 275 million term loan and a 25 million revolving loan commitment the revolving loan commitment may be increased by an additional 35 million as amounts are repaid under the term loan iqvia has guaranteed the performance of the obligations of existing and future subsidiaries that sell and service the accounts receivable under the receivables financing facility the assets of the spe are not available to satisfy any of our obligations or any obligations of our subsidiaries on december 15 2017 we amended our receivables financing facility to extend the original term of the facility to december 15 2020 in addition the applicable margin over libor changed to 90 bps regardless of our credit rating prior to the amendment the margin was based on our credit rating and could range from 85 bps to 135 bps as of december 31 2018 no additional amounts of revolving loans were available under the receivables financing facility

restrictive covenants 

our credit agreement provides for certain covenants and events of default customary for similar instruments including a covenant not to exceed a specified ratio of consolidated senior secured net indebtedness to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement and a covenant to maintain a specified minimum interest coverage ratio if an event of default occurs under any of our financing arrangements the creditors under such financing arrangements will be entitled to take various actions including the acceleration of amounts due under such arrangements and in the case of the lenders under the credit agreement other actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor our longterm debt arrangements contain usual and customary restrictive covenants that among other things place limitations on our ability to declare dividends for additional information regarding these restrictive covenants see part ii item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities—dividend policy” and note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k at december 31 2018 we were in compliance in all material respects with the financial covenants under our financing arrangements 

 

years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 

cash flow from operating activities 



2018 compared to 2017

cash provided by operating activities increased 284 million in 2018 as compared to 2017 the increase is primarily due to higher cashrelated net income of 135 million as well as higher accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and unbilled services due to timing of invoicing and higher payments for interest 

2017 compared to 2016

cash provided by operating activities increased 110 million in 2017 as compared to 2016 cash flows from operating activities reflects higher cashrelated net income of 640 million offset by higher payments for interest income taxes and normal fluctuations in cash collections from clients and accounts payable cash collections from clients can vary significantly each year depending on the timing of cash receipts under contractual payment terms relative to the recognition of revenue over a project lifecycle and the timing of renewals

cash flow from investing activities



2018 compared to 2017 

cash used in investing activities decreased 380 million in 2018 as compared to 2017 the decrease was primarily due to lower cash used for the acquisition of businesses 545 million partially offset by an increase in cash used for acquisition of property equipment and software 90 million an increase in investments in equity securities 23 million and an increase in investments in unconsolidated affiliates 32 million

2017 compared to 2016 

during 2017 we had net cash outflows from investing activities while during 2016 we had net cash inflows the decrease of 2921 million in our net cash flows from investing activities was primarily due to cash from the acquisition of businesses including the merger in 2016 1887 million cash used for the acquisition of businesses in 2017 854 million and higher cash used for the acquisition of property equipment and software in 2017 205 million 

cash flow from financing activities 



2018 compared to 2017 

cash used in financing activities increased 380 million in 2018 as compared to 2017 the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily related to lower net borrowings under our credit facilities 1470 million partially offset by less cash used to repurchase common stock 1215 million

2017 compared to 2016 

cash used in financing activities decreased 2212 million in 2017 as compared to 2016 the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily related to higher net borrowings under our credit facilities 3781 million partially offset by higher cash used to repurchase common stock 1523 million

 

contingencies 

we are exposed to certain known contingencies that are material to our investors the facts and circumstances surrounding these contingencies and a discussion of their effect on us are in note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k these contingencies may have a material effect on our liquidity capital resources or results of operations in addition even where our reserves are adequate the incurrence of any of these liabilities may have a material effect on our liquidity and the amount of cash available to us for other purposes 

we believe that we have made appropriate arrangements in respect of the future effect on us of these known contingencies we also believe that the amount of cash available to us from our operations together with cash from financing will be sufficient for us to pay any known contingencies as they become due without materially affecting our ability to conduct our operations and invest in the growth of our business 

offbalance sheet arrangements

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business

contractual obligations and commitments 

below is a summary of our future payment commitments by year under contractual obligations as of december 31 2018 













 

application of critical accounting policies 

note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates and related disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes known actual results may differ from those estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

our arrangements are primarily service contracts that range in duration from a few months to several years in some cases contracts provide for variable consideration that is contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future events such as performance incentives including royalty payments or penalty clauses that can either increase or decrease the transaction price we estimate the amount of variable consideration at the expected value or at the most likely amount depending on the type of consideration estimated amounts are included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable based on available information historical current and forecasted cash payments made to customers as incentives to induce the customers to enter into service agreements with us are amortized as a reduction of revenue over the period the services are performed we record revenues net of any tax assessments by governmental authorities such as value added taxes that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue generating transactions

we derive the majority of our revenues in the technology  analytics solutions segment from various information and technology services offerings technology services offerings may contain multiple performance obligations consisting of a mix of small and largescale services and consulting projects multiyear outsourcing contracts and softwareasaservice “ saas” arrangements  these arrangements typically have terms ranging from several weeks to three years with a majority having terms of one year or less for arrangements that include multiple performance obligations the transaction price is allocated to the identified performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices for these contracts the standalone selling prices are based on our normal pricing practices when sold separately with consideration of market conditions and other factors including customer demographics and geographic location

the majority of revenue in our research  development solutions segment is recognized over time using a costbased input method since there is no single output measure that would fairly depict the transfer of control over the life of the performance obligation progress on the performance obligation is measured by the proportion of actual costs incurred to the total costs expected to complete the contract costs included in the measure of progress include direct labor and thirdparty costs such as payments to investigators and travel expenses for our clinical monitors this costbased method of revenue recognition requires us to make estimates of costs to complete our projects on an ongoing basis significant judgment is required to evaluate assumptions related to these estimates these significant estimates of project costs are updated and adjusted on a regular basis these updates and adjustments are likely to result in variability in our revenue recognition from period to period that may cause unexpected variability in our operating results at any point in time we are working on thousands of active client projects which are governed by individual contracts most projects are customized based on the needs of the client the type of services being provided therapeutic indication of the drug geographic locations and other variables project specific terms related to pricing billing terms and the scope and type of services to be provided are generally negotiated and contracted on a projectbyproject basis changes in the scope of work are common especially under longterm contracts and generally result in a change in contract value in such situations we enter into negotiations for a contract amendment to reflect the change in scope and the related price depending on the complexity of the amendment the negotiation process can take from a few weeks for a simple adjustment to several months for a complex amendment management may authorize the project team to commence work on activities outside the contract scope while we negotiate and finalize the contract amendment in these limited cases if we are not able to obtain a contract amendment from the client our profit margin on the arrangement may be impacted this result occurs because our costs of delivery are expensed as they are incurred while revenue is not recognized unless the client has agreed to the changes in scope and renegotiated pricing terms in a form that meets the definition of a contract under accounting standards codification topic 606 “revenue from contracts with customers” 

 

the majority of revenue in our contract sales  medical solutions segment is from contract sales to the biopharmaceutical industry and broader healthcare market and recognized over time using a single measure of progress dependent on the performance obligation some of our contract sales  medical solutions contracts contain multiple performance obligations with distinct promises including recruiting sales force automation and deployment of sales representatives the nature of the terms of these performance obligations will vary based on the customized needs of the customer for contracts that have multiple performance obligations the standalone selling prices of our performance obligations are not directly observable since they are rarely sold standalone therefore we estimate the standalone selling prices using an expected cost plus a margin approach under which expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation are forecasted and added to an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service 

see note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

accounts receivable and unbilled services 

accounts receivable represents amounts billed to clients revenues recognized in excess of billings are classified as unbilled services the realization of these amounts is based on the client’s willingness and ability to pay us we have an allowance for doubtful accounts based on management’s estimate of probable losses we expect to incur resulting from a client failing to pay us our allowance for doubtful accounts and losses from clients failing to pay us have not been material to our results of operations if any of these estimates change or actual results differs from expected results then an adjustment is recorded in the period in which the amounts become reasonably estimable these adjustments could have a material effect on our results of operations 

investments in unconsolidated affiliates—equity method investments 

we have investments in unconsolidated affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting periodically we review our investments for a decline in value which we believe may be other than temporary should we identify such a decline we will record a loss through earnings to establish a new cost basis for the investment these losses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

income taxes 

certain items of income and expense are not recognized on our income tax returns and financial statements in the same year which creates timing differences the income tax effect of these timing differences results in 1 deferred income tax assets that create a reduction in future income taxes and 2 deferred income tax liabilities that create an increase in future income taxes recognition of deferred income tax assets is based on management’s belief that it is more likely than not that the income tax benefit associated with certain temporary differences income tax operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and income tax credits would be realized we recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets for those deferred income tax items for which it was more likely than not that realization would not occur we determined the amount of the valuation allowance based in part on our assessment of future taxable income and in light of our ongoing income tax strategies if our estimate of future taxable income or tax strategies changes at any time in the future we would record an adjustment to our valuation allowance recording such an adjustment could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

income tax expense is based on the distribution of profit before income tax among the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate adjusted as required by the income tax laws of each taxing jurisdiction changes in the distribution of profits and losses among taxing jurisdictions may have a significant impact on our effective income tax rate we do not consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states accordingly we have provided a deferred income tax liability related to those undistributed earnings the associated foreign income taxes on our foreign earnings could be available as a credit in the united states on our income taxes we recognize foreign tax credits to the extent that the recognition is supported by projected foreign source income see note 16 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the annual report on form 10k for details regarding the tax cuts and jobs act and the impact on our consolidated financial statements

 

business combinations 

we use the acquisition method to account for business combinations and accordingly the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recorded at their estimated fair values on the date of the acquisition we use significant judgments estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest including expected future cash flows discount rates that reflect the risk associated with the expected future cash flows and estimated useful lives 

when a business combination involves contingent consideration we recognize a liability equal to the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the date of the acquisition the estimate of fair value of a contingent consideration liability requires subjective assumptions to be made regarding future business results including revenues and net new business discount rates that reflect the risk associated with the expected future cash flows and probabilities assigned to various potential business result scenarios we reassess the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration each financial reporting period over the term of the arrangement any resulting changes are recognized in earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations 

goodwill tangible and identifiable intangible assets 

we have recorded and allocated to our reporting units the excess of the cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired known as goodwill the recoverability of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated annually for impairment or if and when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment we review the carrying values of other identifiable intangible assets if the facts and circumstances indicate a possible impairment goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized and other identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives we believe that the risk of an impairment to goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets is currently very low 

for goodwill we perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its book value this includes a qualitative analysis of macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations internal cost factors financial performance fair value history and other company specific events if this qualitative analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that estimated fair value is less than the book value for the respective reporting unit we apply a twostep impairment test in which we determine whether the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of its carrying value if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied estimated fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill we determine the implied estimated fair value of goodwill by determining the present value of the estimated future cash flows for each reporting unit and comparing the reporting unit’s risk profile and growth prospects to selected reasonably similar publicly traded companies the inherent subjectivity of applying a discounted cash flow and market comparables approach to valuing our assets and liabilities could have a significant impact on our analysis any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

for indefinitelived intangible assets we perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value if this qualitative analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset we determine the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset trade name by determining the present value of the estimated royalty payments on an aftertax basis that it would be required to pay the owner for the right to use such trade name if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we review the carrying values of property and equipment if the facts and circumstances suggest that a potential impairment may have occurred if this review indicates that carrying values will not be recoverable as determined based on undiscounted cash flows over the remaining depreciation or amortization period we will reduce carrying values to estimated fair value the inherent subjectivity of our estimates of future cash flows could have a significant impact on our analysis any future writeoffs of longlived assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

 

stockbased compensation 

we measure compensation cost for stockbased payment awards stock options and stock appreciation rights granted to employees and nonemployee directors at fair value using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model and for performance awards using the monte carlo simulation model stockbased compensation expense includes stockbased awards granted to employees and nonemployee directors and has been reported in selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income based upon the classification of the individuals who were granted stockbased awards 

the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions including share price volatility the expected life of the award riskfree interest rate and the fair value of the underlying common shares on the date of grant in developing our assumptions we take into account the following 











pensions and other postretirement benefits

we provide retirement benefits to certain employees including defined benefit pension plans and postretirement medical plans the determination of benefit obligations and expense is based on actuarial models in order to measure benefit costs and obligations using these models critical assumptions are made with regard to the discount rate expected return on plan assets cash balance crediting rate lump sum conversion rate and the assumed rate of compensation increases in addition retiree medical care cost trend rates are a key assumption used exclusively in determining costs for our postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans management reviews these critical assumptions at least annually other assumptions involve demographic factors such as turnover retirement and mortality rates management reviews these assumptions periodically and updates them when deemed appropriate to do so 

the discount rate is the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled and is determined annually by management for united states plans the discount rate is based on results of a modeling process in which the plans’ expected cash flow determined on a projected benefit obligation basis is matched with spot rates developed from a yield curve comprised of highgrade moody’s aa and above or standard and poor’s aa and above noncallable corporate bonds to develop the present value of the expected cash flow and then determining the single rate discount rate which when applied to the expected cash flow derives that same present value in the united kingdom specifically the discount rate is set based on the yields on a universe of high quality noncallable corporate bonds denominated in the british pound appropriate to the duration of plan liabilities for the other nonunited states plans the discount rate is based on the current yield of an index of high quality corporate bonds as a sensitivity measure a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate for our united states plan and united kingdom plans absent any offsetting changes in other assumptions would result in a less than 1 million increase in pension expense at december 31 2018 

under the united states qualified retirement plan participants have a notional retirement account that increases with pay and investment credits the rate used to determine the investment credit cash balance crediting rate varies monthly at retirement the account is converted to a monthly retirement benefit 

 

in selecting an expected return on plan asset assumption we consider the returns being earned by each plan investment category in the fund the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment and longterm economic forecasts for the type of investments held by the plan the actual return on plan assets will vary from year to year versus this assumption we believe it is appropriate to use longterm expected forecasts in selecting the expected return on plan assets as such there can be no assurance that our actual return on plan assets will approximate the longterm expected forecasts as a sensitivity measure a 25 basis point change in the expected return on assets “eroa” assumption for our united states plan absent any offsetting changes in other assumptions would result in a less than 1 million increase or decrease in pension expense at december 31 2018 for our united kingdom plans a 25 basis point change in the eroa assumption absent any offsetting changes in other assumptions would result in a less than 1 million increase or decrease in pension expense at december 31 2018 while we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our pension and postretirement obligations and future expense 

we utilize a corridor approach to amortizing unrecognized gains and losses in the pension and postretirement plans amortization occurs when the accumulated unrecognized net gain or loss balance exceeds the criterion of 10 of the larger of the beginning balances of the projected benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of the plan assets the excess unrecognized gain or loss balance is then amortized using the straightline method over the average remaining service life of active employees expected to receive benefits at december 31 2018 the weightedaverage remaining service life of active employees was approximately 20 years 

foreign currency 

we have significant investments in nonunited states countries therefore changes in the value of foreign currencies affect our consolidated financial statements when translated into united states dollars for all operations outside the united states where we have designated the local currency as the functional currency assets and liabilities are translated using endofperiod exchange rates revenues expenses and cash flows are translated using average rates of exchange prevailing during the period the transactions occurred translation gains and losses are included as an adjustment to the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders’ equity in addition gains and losses from foreign currency transactions such as those resulting from the settlement and revaluation of thirdparty and intercompany foreign receivables and payables are included in the determination of net income loss 

for operations outside the united states that are considered to be highly inflationary or where the united states dollar is designated as the functional currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured using endofperiod exchange rates whereas nonmonetary accounts are remeasured using historical exchange rates and all remeasurement and transaction adjustments are recognized in other expense income net 

recently issued accounting standards 

information relating to recently issued accounting standards is included in note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to various market risks and we regularly evaluate our exposure to such changes our overall risk management strategy seeks to balance the magnitude of the exposure and the cost and availability of appropriate financial instruments the following analyses present the sensitivity of our financial instruments to hypothetical changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period 

foreign currency exchange rates 

we transact business in more than 100 countries and approximately 55 currencies and are subject to risks associated with fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates our objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency exchange rate movements accordingly we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the impact of foreign exchange movements on non–functional currency assets and liabilities we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency cash flows related to service contracts and to hedge nonunited states dollar anticipated intercompany royalties it is our policy to enter into foreign currency transactions only to the extent necessary to meet our objectives as stated above we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for investment or speculative purposes the principal currencies hedged are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the swiss franc and the canadian dollar 

 

the contractual value of our foreign exchange derivative instruments all of which were foreign exchange forward contracts was approximately 202 million at december 31 2018 the fair value of these contracts is subject to change as a result of potential changes in foreign exchange rates we assess our market risk based on changes in foreign exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in fair values based on a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates the potential loss in fair value for foreign exchange forward contracts based on a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the united states dollar or in the case of nonunited states dollar related contracts the currency being purchased was 5 million at december 31 2018 however the change in the fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts would likely be offset by a change in the value of the future service contract revenue  royalty or balance sheet exposure being hedged caused by the currency exchange rate fluctuation  the estimated fair values of the foreign exchange forward contracts were determined based on quoted market prices 

exchange rate fluctuations affect the united states dollar value of foreign currency revenue and expenses and may have a significant effect on our results excluding the impacts from any outstanding or future hedging transactions a hypothetical 10 change in average exchange rates used to translate all foreign currencies to the united states dollar would have impacted income before income taxes for 2018 by approximately 125 million the actual impact of exchange rate movements in the future could differ materially from this hypothetical analysis based on the mix of foreign currencies and the timing and magnitude of individual exchange rate movements 

additionally commencing in 2016 we designated a portion of our foreign currency denominated debt as a hedge of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries to reduce the volatility in stockholders’ equity caused by changes in the euro exchange rate with respect to the united states dollar as of december 31 2018 these borrowings net of original issue discount were €4590 million 5253 million a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the united states dollar would lead to a potential loss in fair value of 525 million however this change in fair value would be offset by the change in value of the hedged portion of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries caused by the currency exchange rate fluctuation   

interest rates 

because we have variable rate debt fluctuations in interest rates affect our business we attempt to minimize interest rate risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate caps and swaps we have entered into interest rate caps and swaps with financial institutions that have reset dates and critical terms that match the underlying debt accordingly any change in market value associated with the interest rate caps and swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt as of december 31 2018 we had approximately 64 billion of variable rate indebtedness and interest rate caps and swaps with a notional value of 20 billion because we do not attempt to hedge all of our variable rate debt we may incur higher interest costs for the portion of our variable rate debt that is not hedged excluding debt covered by hedges each quarterpoint increase or decrease in the interest rate on our variable rate debt would result in our interest expense changing by approximately 12 million per year 

marketable securities 

at december 31 2018 we held investments in marketable equity securities these investments are classified as either trading securities or availableforsale securities and are recorded at fair value these securities are subject to price risk as of december 31 2018 the fair value of these investments was 47 million based on the quoted market value of the securities the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease of 10 in quoted market values was approximately 5 million at december 31 2018

 item 1 business 

our company 

we are a leading global provider of information innovative technology solutions and contract research services focused on helping healthcare clients find better solutions for patients formed through the merger of ims health and quintiles we apply human data science – leveraging the analytic rigor and clarity of data science to the everexpanding scope of human science – to enable companies to reimagine and develop new approaches to clinical development and commercialization speed innovation and accelerate improvements in healthcare outcomes powered by the iqvia core™ we deliver unique and actionable insights at the intersection of large scale analytics transformative technology and extensive domain expertise as well as execution capabilities to help biotech medical device and pharmaceutical companies medical researchers government agencies payers and other healthcare stakeholders tap into a deeper understanding of diseases human behaviors and scientific advances in an effort to advance their path toward cures with more than 55000 employees we conduct operations in more than 100 countries

we have one of the largest and most comprehensive collections of healthcare information in the world which includes more than 530 million comprehensive longitudinal nonidentified patient records spanning sales prescription and promotional data medical claims electronic medical records and social media our scaled and growing data set contains approximately 30 petabytes of proprietary data sourced from more than 120000 data suppliers and covering over 900000 data feeds globally based on this data we deliver information and insights on over 85 of the world’s pharmaceuticals as measured by 2016 sales we standardize organize structure and integrate this data by applying our sophisticated analytics and leveraging our global technology infrastructure this helps our clients run their organizations more efficiently and make better decisions to improve their clinical commercial and financial performance the breadth of the intelligent actionable information we provide is not comprehensively available from any other source and our scope of information would be difficult and costly for another party to replicate 

we leverage our proprietary information assets to develop clinical and commercial capabilities with a talented healthcarefocused workforce that enables us to grow our relationships with healthcare stakeholders throughout the life science’s value chain this set of capabilities includes 











 

our missioncritical relationships with our life science clients consist of four important decisionmaking processes related to their product portfolios research and development prelaunch launch and inmarket we continue to develop software and services applications to further deepen our level of client integration by enabling our clients to enhance andor automate many components of these key decisionmaking processes 

 

 



 

we believe that a powerful component of our value proposition is the breadth and depth of intelligence we provide to help our clients address fundamental operational questions 

 



 

our market opportunity 

we compete in a market of greater than 230 billion consisting of outsourced research and development realworld evidence and connected health and technology enabled commercial operations markets for the life sciences companies and the broader healthcare industry the following sets forth our estimates for the size of our principal markets 







in deriving estimates of the size of the various markets described above we review thirdparty sources which include estimates and forecasts of spending in various segments in combination with internal iqvia research and analysis informed by our experience serving these segments as well as projected growth rates for each of these segments see “industry and market data” above   

we believe there are six key trends affecting our end markets that will create increasing demand for research and development services and commercial solutions 

growth and innovation in the life sciences industry the life sciences industry is a large and critical part of the global healthcare system and according to the latest information available from the iqvia market prognosis service is estimated to have generated approximately 11 trillion in revenue in 2017 according to our research revenue growth in the life sciences industry globally is expected to range from 3 to 6 between 2018 and 2022 according to the iqvia institute it is estimated that spending on pharmaceuticals in emerging markets will expand at a 6 to 9 compound annual growth rate “cagr” through 2022 the growth of emerging markets is making these geographies strategically important to life sciences organizations and consistent with their approach in the developed markets we expect these organizations to apply a high degree of sophistication to their commercial operations in these countries for global companies this requires highly localized knowledge and information assets the development of market access strategies and performance benchmarking in addition local players are learning that they need to compete on the basis of improved information and analytics 

growth in research and development spending trends in research and development are impacted as a result of several factors including major biopharmaceutical companies’ efforts to replenish revenues lost from the socalled “patent cliff” increased access to capital by the small and midcap biotechnology industry and recent increases in pharmaceutical approvals by regulatory authorities the iqvia institute also estimates that approximately 225 new molecular entities “nmes” are expected to be approved between 2018 and 2022 compared to 208 between 2012 and 2016 and 149 between 2007 and 2011 we believe that further research and development spending combined with the continued need for cost efficiency across the healthcare landscape will continue to create opportunities for biopharmaceutical services companies particularly those with a global reach and broad service offerings to help biopharmaceutical companies with their pre and postlaunch solutions development and commercialization needs 

increased complexity in research and development biopharmaceutical companies face environments in which it has become increasingly difficult to operate improved standards of care in many therapeutic areas and the emergence of new types of therapies such as biologics genetically targeted therapies gene and stem cell therapies and other treatment modalities have led to more complex development and regulatory pathways for example the united states and european countries have recently released guidelines for the development of “biosimilar” products we believe that our global clinical development capabilities including our expertise in biomarkers and genomics and our global laboratory network position us well to help biopharmaceutical companies manage the complexities inherent in an environment where this type of expertise is important 

 

regulators require clinical trials involving local populations as part of the process for approving new pharmaceutical products especially in certain asian and emerging markets understanding the epidemiological and physiological differences in different ethnic populations and being able to conduct clinical trials locally in certain geographies will be important to pharmaceutical product growth strategies both for multinational and localregional biopharmaceutical companies we believe that our global clinical development capabilities and unmatched presence in asia and other emerging markets make us a strong partner for biopharmaceutical companies managing the complexities of international drug development 

financial pressures driving the need for increased efficiency despite expected accelerating growth in the global life sciences market we believe our clients will face increased operating margin pressure due to their changing product mix pricing and reimbursement challenges and rising costs of compliance product portfolios for life sciences companies have shifted toward specialty products with lower peak market sales potential than traditional primary care medicines we believe that the need for biopharmaceutical companies to maximize productivity and lower costs across their processes from research and development through commercial operations will cause them to look to partners as they enter into outsourcing arrangements to improve efficiency further our clients are looking for new ways to simplify processes and drive operational efficiencies by using automation consolidating vendors and adopting new technology options such as hosted and cloudbased applications this provides opportunities for technology services vendors to capture and consolidate internal spending by providing lowercost and variablecost options that lower clients’ research and development selling marketing and administrative costs 

evolving need to integrate and structure expanding sources of data over the past decade many health systems around the world have focused on digitizing medical records while such records theoretically enhance access to data relevant information is often unintegrated unstructured siloed in disparate software systems or entered inconsistently in addition new sources of data from the internet such as social media and information on limited patient pools and information resulting from enhanced diagnostic technologies are creating new sources of healthcare data 

in order to derive valuable insights from existing and expanding sources of information clients need access to statistically significant data sets organized into databases that can be queried and analyzed for example realworld evidence studies demonstrate practical and clinical efficacies which we believe require the aggregation and integration of large clinical data sets across all care settings types of therapies and patient cohorts longitudinal studies require analysis of nonidentified patient diagnoses treatments procedures and laboratory test results to identify types of patients that will likely best respond to particular therapies finally manufacturers also require the ability to analyze social media activity to identify unmet patient needs and support for new orphan drugs this information is highly relevant to all healthcare stakeholders and we believe the opportunity to more broadly apply healthcare data can only be realized through structuring organizing and integrating new and existing forms of data in conjunction with sophisticated analytics 

need for demonstrated value in healthcare participants in the healthcare industry are focused on improving quality and reducing costs both of which require assessment of quality and value of therapies and providers as a result physicians no longer make prescribing decisions in isolation but rather in the context of guidance and rules from payers integrated delivery networks and governments we believe life sciences companies are working to bring alignment across constituents on the value of their treatments in order to successfully develop and commercialize new therapies 

there is increasing pressure on life sciences companies to support and justify the value of their therapies many new drugs that are being approved are more expensive than existing therapies and will likely receive heightened scrutiny by regulators and payers to determine whether the existing treatment options would be sufficient additionally many new specialty drugs are molecularbased therapies and require a more detailed understanding of clinical factors and influencers that demonstrate therapeutic value as a result leading life sciences companies are utilizing more sophisticated outcome research and data analytics services 

we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of these global trends in healthcare beyond our proprietary information assets we have developed key capabilities to assess opportunities to develop and commercialize therapies support and defend the value of medicines and help our clients operate more efficiently through the application of insightdriven decisionmaking and costefficient technology solutions 

 

our growth strategy 

we believe we are well positioned for continued growth across the markets we serve our strategy for achieving growth includes 

continue to innovate by leveraging our information advanced analytics technology and domain expertise as a leader in the development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical therapies we can empower our therapeutic scientific and domain experts with expansive levels of information including product level tracking in 90 markets and information about treatments and outcomes on more than 530 million nonidentified patients further we have the ability to optimize the clinical trial process and enable our clients to reduce costs and get their products to market more quickly by running their clinical trials more efficiently and effectively through more informed site selection and faster patient recruitment practices 

build upon our extensive client relationships  we have a diversified base of over 8000 clients in over 100 countries and have expanded our client value proposition to address a broader market for research and development and commercial operations which we estimate to be more than 230 billion in 2017 through the combined offerings of research and development and commercial services we built a platform that allows us to be a more complete partner to our clients 

expand portfolio through strategic acquisitions we have and expect to continue to acquire assets and businesses that strengthen our value proposition to clients we have developed an internal capability to source evaluate and integrate acquisitions that have created value for stockholders as the global healthcare landscape evolves we expect that there will be a growing number of acquisition opportunities across the life sciences payer and provider sectors we expect to continue to invest in or explore opportunities for strategic acquisitions to grow our platform and enhance our ability to provide more services to our clients 

expand the penetration of our offerings to the broader healthcare marketplace we believe that substantial opportunities exist to expand penetration of our market and further integrate our offerings in a broader crosssection of the healthcare marketplace particularly connected healthcare

good clinical practice 

good clinical practice “gcp” regulations and guidelines are the industry standard for the conduct of clinical trials with respect to maintaining the integrity of the data and safety of the research subjects the united states food and drug administration “fda” the european medicines agency “ema” japan’s ministry of health labour and welfare and most other global regulatory authorities expect that study results and data submitted to such authorities be based on clinical trials conducted in accordance with gcp provisions records for clinical trials must be maintained for specified periods for inspection by the fda and other regulators 

regulation of drugs biologics and medical devices 

in the united states pharmaceutical biological and medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by the fda the federal food drug and cosmetic act “fdc act” the public health service act “phs act” and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern among other things the research development testing manufacture storage recordkeeping approval labeling promotion and marketing distribution postapproval monitoring and reporting sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical biological and medical device products failure to comply with applicable united states requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions such as fda refusal to approve a pending new drug application “nda” for a new drug a biologics license application “bla” for a new biological product premarket approval “pma” or clearance for a new medical device warning or untitled letters product recalls product seizures total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions fines civil penalties and criminal prosecution 

regulation of patient information 

our information management services relate to the processing of information regarding patient diagnosis and treatment of disease and are therefore subject to substantial governmental regulation in addition the confidentiality of patientspecific information and the circumstances under which such patientspecific records may be released for inclusion in our databases or used in other aspects of our business is heavily regulated federal state and foreign governments are contemplating or have proposed or adopted additional legislation governing the possession use and dissemination of personal data such as personal health information and personal financial data as well as security breach notification rules for loss or theft of such data additional legislation or regulation of this type might among other things require us to implement additional security measures and processes or bring within the legislation or regulation deidentified health or other data each of which may require substantial expenditures or limit our ability to offer some of our services 

in particular personal health information is recognized in many countries such as the united states the european union or eu and several countries in asia as a special sensitive category of personal information subject to additional mandatory protections violations of data protection regulations are subject to administrative penalties civil money penalties and criminal prosecution including corporate fines and personal liability 

regulation of promotion marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products and medical devices 

certain of our services are subject to detailed and comprehensive regulation in each geographic market in which we operate such regulation relates among other things to the distribution of drug samples the marketing and promotion of approved products the qualifications of sales representatives and the use of healthcare professionals in sales functions 

 

in the united states certain of our services are subject to numerous federal and state laws pertaining to promotional activities involving pharmaceutical products and medical devices certain of our services are subject to the fda’s regulations against “offlabel promotion” which require sales representatives to restrict promotion of the approved product they are detailing to the approved labeling for the product the prescription drug marketing act imposes licensing personnel record keeping packaging labeling product handling and facility storage and security requirements other federal and state laws prohibit manufacturers suppliers and providers from offering giving or receiving kickbacks or other remuneration in connection with ordering or recommending the purchase or rental of healthcare items and services the sale or distribution of pharmaceutical products and devices is also governed by the united states federal trade commission act and state consumer protection laws we are subject to similar regulations currently in effect in the other countries where we offer integrated engagement services 

we are also subject to various laws and regulations that may apply to certain drug and device promotional practices including among others various aspects of medicare and federal healthcare programs violations of these laws and regulations may result in criminal andor civil penalties including possibly as an “aider and abettor”   

regulation of laboratories 

our united states “central” laboratories are subject to licensing and regulation under federal state and local laws relating to hazard communication and employee righttoknow regulations and the safety and health of laboratory employees additionally our united states laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations and licensing requirements relating to the handling storage and disposal of hazardous waste radioactive materials and laboratory specimens including the regulations of the environmental protection agency the nuclear regulatory commission the department of transportation the national fire protection agency and the united states drug enforcement administration “dea” the use of controlled substances in testing for drugs with a potential for abuse is regulated in the united states by the dea and by similar regulatory bodies in other parts of the world our united states laboratories using controlled substances for testing purposes are licensed by the dea the regulations of the united states department of transportation public health service and postal service apply to the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens our laboratories also are subject to international air transport association regulations which govern international shipments of laboratory specimens furthermore when the materials are sent to a foreign country the transportation of such materials becomes subject to the laws rules and regulations of such foreign country our laboratories outside the united states are subject to applicable national laws governing matters such as licensing the handling and disposal of medical specimens hazardous waste and radioactive materials as well as the health and safety of laboratory employees 

in addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace the united states occupational safety and health administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers may be exposed to bloodborne pathogens such as hiv and the hepatitis b virus although we believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with such federal state and local laws failure to comply with such laws could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business fines criminal penalties and other enforcement actions 

further laboratories that analyze human blood or other biological samples for the diagnosis and treatment of clinical trial subjects must comply with clinical laboratory improvement amendments “clia” as well as requirements established by various states the failure to meet these requirements may result in civil penalties and suspension or revocation of the clia certification

 item 1a risk factors 

risk factors

we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks some of which are beyond our control you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below together with the other information included in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating our company the occurrence of any of the following risks may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects 

risks relating to our business 

the potential loss or delay of our large contracts or of multiple contracts could adversely affect our results 

most of our research  development solutions clients can terminate our contracts upon 30 to 90 days notice our clients may delay terminate or reduce the scope of our contracts for a variety of reasons beyond our control including but not limited to 























as a result contract terminations delays and alterations are a regular part of our research  development solutions business in the event of termination our contracts often provide for fees for winding down the project but these fees may not be sufficient for us to maintain our margins and termination may result in lower resource utilization rates in addition we will not realize the full benefits of our backlog of contractually committed services if our clients cancel delay or reduce their commitments under our contracts with them which may occur if among other things a client decides to shift its business to a competitor or revoke our status as a preferred provider thus the loss or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could adversely affect our revenues and profitability we believe the risk of loss or delay of multiple contracts potentially has greater effect where we are party to broader partnering arrangements with global biopharmaceutical companies 

  we depend on third parties for data and support services our suppliers or providers might restrict our use of or refuse to license data or provide services which could lead to our inability to access certain data or provide certain services and as a result materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

each of our commercial solutions information services is derived from data we collect from third parties these data suppliers are numerous and diverse reflecting the broad scope of information that we collect and use in our business 

 

although we typically enter into longterm contractual arrangements with many of these suppliers of data at the time of entry into a new contract or renewal of an existing contract suppliers may increase restrictions on our use of such data increase the price they charge us for data or refuse altogether to license the data to us in addition during the term of any data supply contract suppliers may fail to adhere to our data quality control standards or fail to deliver data further although no single individual data supplier is material to our business if a number of suppliers collectively representing a significant amount of data that we use for one or more of our services were to impose additional contractual restrictions on our use of or access to data fail to adhere to our qualitycontrol standards repeatedly fail to deliver data or refuse to provide data now or in the future our ability to provide those services to our clients could be materially adversely impacted which may harm our operating results and financial condition 

additionally we depend on third parties for support services to our business such support services include but are not limited to thirdparty transportation providers suppliers of drugs for patients participating in clinical trials suppliers of kits for use in our clinical trial laboratories business suppliers of reagents for use in our testing equipment and providers of maintenance contracts for our equipment the failure of any of these third parties to adequately provide the critical support services could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if we fail to perform our services in accordance with contractual requirements regulatory standards and ethical considerations we could be subject to significant costs or liability and our reputation could be harmed 

we contract with biopharmaceutical companies to perform a wide range of services to assist them in bringing new drugs to market our services include monitoring clinical trials data and laboratory analysis electronic data capture patient recruitment and other related services such services are complex and subject to contractual requirements regulatory standards and ethical considerations for example we must adhere to regulatory requirements such as the fda and current gcp good laboratory practice and good manufacturing practice requirements if we fail to perform our services in accordance with these requirements regulatory agencies may take action against us for failure to comply with applicable regulations governing clinical trials or sales and marketing practices such actions may include sanctions such as injunctions or failure of such regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of products delay suspension or withdrawal of approvals license revocation product seizures or recalls operational restrictions civil or criminal penalties or prosecutions damages or fines clients may also bring claims against us for breach of our contractual obligations and patients in the clinical trials and patients taking drugs approved on the basis of those clinical trials may bring personal injury claims against us for negligence any such action could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and reputation 

such consequences could arise if among other things the following occur 

improper performance of our services the performance of clinical development services is complex and timeconsuming for example we may make mistakes in conducting a clinical trial that could negatively impact or obviate the usefulness of the clinical trial or cause the results of the clinical trial to be reported improperly if the clinical trial results are compromised we could be subject to significant costs or liability which could have an adverse impact on our ability to perform our services as examples 







large clinical trials can cost up to hundreds of millions of dollars and while we endeavor to contractually limit our exposure to such risks improper performance of our services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition damage our reputation and result in the cancellation of current contracts by or failure to obtain future contracts from the affected client or other clients 

investigation of clients from time to time one or more of our clients are audited or investigated by regulatory authorities or enforcement agencies with respect to regulatory compliance of their clinical trials programs or the marketing and sale of their drugs in these situations we have often provided services to our clients with respect to the clinical trials programs or activities being audited or investigated and we are called upon to respond to requests for information by the authorities and agencies there is a risk that either our clients or regulatory authorities could claim that we performed our services improperly or that we are responsible for clinical trial or program compliance if our clients or regulatory authorities make such claims against us and prove them we could be subject to damages fines or penalties in addition negative publicity regarding regulatory compliance of our clients’ clinical trials programs or drugs could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

 

insufficient client funding to complete a clinical trial as noted above clinical trials can cost hundreds of millions of dollars there is a risk that we may initiate a clinical trial for a client and then the client becomes unwilling or unable to fund the completion of the clinical trial in such a situation notwithstanding the client’s ability or willingness to pay for or otherwise facilitate the completion of the clinical trial we may be ethically bound to complete or wind down the clinical trial at our own expense 

security breaches and unauthorized use of our it systems and information or the it systems or information in the possession of our vendors could expose us our clients our data suppliers or others to risk of loss 

we rely upon the security of our computer and communications systems infrastructure to protect us from cyberattacks and unauthorized access cyberattacks can include malware computer viruses hacking or other significant disruption of our computer communications and related systems cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems as cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against one or more cyber threats might defeat the measures that we or our vendors take to anticipate detect avoid or mitigate such threats certain techniques used to obtain unauthorized access introduce malicious software disable or degrade service or sabotage systems may be designed to remain dormant until a triggering event and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures since techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources although we take steps to manage and avoid these risks and to prevent their recurrence our preventive and remedial actions may not be successful such attacks whether successful or unsuccessful could result in our incurring costs related to for example rebuilding internal systems defending against litigation responding to regulatory inquiries or actions paying damages or fines or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties publicity about vulnerabilities and attempted or successful incursions could damage our reputation with clients and data suppliers and reduce demand for our services 

we also store proprietary and sensitive information in connection with our business which could be compromised by a cyberattack to the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data an inappropriate disclosure of proprietary or sensitive information an inability to access data sources or an inability to process data or provide our offerings to our clients it could cause significant damage to our reputation affect our relationships with our data suppliers and clients including loss of suppliers and clients lead to claims against us and ultimately harm our business we may be required to incur significant costs to alleviate remedy or protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future we may also face inquiry or increased scrutiny from government agencies as a result of any such disruption or breach while we have insurance coverage for certain instances of a cyber security breach our coverage may not be sufficient if we suffer a significant attack or multiple attacks any such breach or disruption could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and our reputation as a provider of missioncritical services 

some of our vendors have significant responsibility for the security of certain of our data centers and computerbased platforms also our data suppliers have responsibility for security of their own computer and communications environments these third parties face risks relating to cyber security similar to ours which could disrupt their businesses and therefore materially impact ours accordingly we are subject to any flaw in or breaches to their computer and communications systems or those that they operate for us which could result in a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial results 

failure to meet productivity objectives under our internal business transformation initiatives could adversely impact our competitiveness and harm our operating results 

we are pursuing business transformation initiatives to update technology increase innovation and obtain operating efficiencies as part of these initiatives we seek to improve our productivity flexibility quality functionality and cost savings by investing in the development and implementation of global platforms and integration of our business processes and functions to achieve economies of scale for example we are moving local standardizing and cleaning from countries around the world to asia and retiring local standardizing and cleaning systems these various initiatives may not yield their intended gains which may impact our competitiveness and our ability to meet our growth objectives and as a result materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

 

if we are unsuccessful at investing in growth opportunities our business could be materially and adversely affected 

we continue to invest significantly in growth opportunities including the development and acquisition of new data technologies and services to meet our clients’ needs for example we are expanding our services and technology offerings such as the development of a cloudbased platform with a growing number of applications to support commercial operations for life sciences companies eg multichannel marketing marketing campaign management customer relationship management incentive compensation management targeting and segmentation performance management and other applications we also continue to invest significantly in growth opportunities in emerging markets such as the development launch and enhancement of services in china india russia turkey and other countries we believe healthcare spending in these emerging markets will continue to grow over the next five years and we consider our presence in these markets to be an important focus of our growth strategy 

there is no assurance that our investment plans or growth strategy will be successful or will produce a sufficient or any return on our investments further if we are unable to develop new technologies and services clients do not purchase our new technologies and services our new technologies and services do not work as intended or there are delays in the availability or adoption of our new technologies and services then we may not be able to grow our business or growth may occur slower than anticipated additionally although we expect continued growth in healthcare spending in emerging markets such spending may occur more slowly or not at all and we may not benefit from our investments in these markets

  we plan to fund growth opportunities with cash from operations or from future financings there can be no assurance that those sources will be available in sufficient amounts to fund future growth opportunities when needed 

any of the foregoing could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

data protection privacy and similar laws in the united states and around the world restrict access use and disclosure of personal information and failure to comply with or adapt to changes in these laws could materially and adversely harm our business 

the confidentiality collection use and disclosure of personal data including individually identifiable health information and clinical trial patientspecific information are subject to governmental regulation generally in the country that the personal data were collected or used for example united states federal regulations under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” create specific requirements for the protection of the privacy and security of individual health information these provisions apply to both “covered entities” primarily health care providers and health insurers and their “business associates” or service providers as there are some instances where we are a hipaa “business associate” of a “covered entity” we can be directly liable for mishandling protected health information under hipaa’s enforcement scheme we can be subject to significant penalties in connection with hipaa violations along with the potential for significant other expenditures related to these activities these rules require individuals’ written authorization in many situations in addition to any required informed consent before protected health information may be used for research we are both directly and indirectly affected by the privacy provisions surrounding individual authorizations because many investigators with whom we are involved in clinical trials are directly subject to them as a hipaa “covered entity” and because we obtain identifiable health information from third parties that are subject to such regulations the laws and regulations related to the protection of personal health information in connection with research activities are under reevaluation particularly in the united states and changes to these regulations could have a material adverse impact on our ability to provide some of our services in their current form or maintain our profitability in general patient health information is among the most sensitive and highly regulated of personal information and laws and regulations around the united states and the world are designed to ensure that information about an individual’s healthcare is properly protected from inappropriate access use and disclosure laws restricting access use and disclosure of patient health information also include the european union’s “eu” general data protection regulation canada’s personal information protection and electronic documents act and other data protection privacy data security and similar national stateprovincial and local laws in the eu personal data includes any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person with health information carrying additional obligations including obtaining the explicit consent from the individual for collection use or disclosure of the information in addition we are subject to eu rules with respect to crossborder transfers of such data out of the eu along with similar data transfer requirements in other countries the united states the eu and its member states and other countries where we have operations such as japan south korea malaysia the philippines russia and singapore continue to issue new privacy and data protection rules and regulations that relate to personal data and health information 

 

we have established frameworks models processes and technologies to manage privacy and security for many data types from a variety of sources and under myriad privacy and data protection laws worldwide in addition we rely on our data suppliers to deliver information to us in a form and in a manner that complies with applicable privacy and data protection laws these laws are complex and there is no assurance that the safeguards and controls employed by us or our data suppliers will be sufficient to prevent a breach of these laws or that claims will not be filed against us or our data suppliers despite such safeguards and controls failure to comply with such laws certain certificationregistration and annual recertificationregistration provisions associated with these data protection and privacy regulations and similar rules in various jurisdictions or to resolve any serious privacy complaints may result in among other things regulatory sanctions criminal prosecution civil liability negative publicity damage to our reputation or data being blocked from use or liability under contractual provisions for example in july 2015 indictments were issued by the seoul central district prosecutors’ office in south korea against ims korea and two of its employees among others alleging improper handling of sensitive health information in violation of applicable privacy laws see item 3 “legal proceedings” for additional information 

laws and expectations relating to privacy continue to evolve and we continue to adapt to changing needs for example the definition of “personally identifiable information” and “personal data” continues to evolve and broaden and many new laws and regulations are being enacted in addition certain longestablished programs have been or are at risk of being declared invalid such as the euus safe harbor framework that operated for many years but was struck down by european courts in 2015 so that this area remains in a state of flux changes to these programs may adversely impact our ability to provide services to our clients or develop new products or services federal state and foreign governments are contemplating or have proposed or adopted additional legislation governing the collection possession use or dissemination of personal data such as personal health information and personal financial data as well as security breach notification rules for loss or theft of such data additional legislation or regulation of this type might among other things require us to implement new security measures and processes or bring within the legislation other personal data not currently regulated each of which may require substantial expenditures or limit our ability to offer some of our services additionally changes in these laws including newly released interpretations of these laws by courts and regulatory bodies may limit our data access use and disclosure and may require increased expenditures by us or may dictate that we not offer certain types of services any of the foregoing may have a material adverse impact on our ability to provide services to our clients or maintain our profitability

there is ongoing concern from privacy advocates regulators and others regarding data protection and privacy issues and the number of jurisdictions with data protection and privacy laws has been increasing also there are ongoing public policy discussions regarding whether the standards for deidentified anonymous or pseudonymized health information are sufficient and the risk of reidentification sufficiently small to adequately protect patient privacy these discussions may lead to further restrictions on the use of such information there can be no assurance that these initiatives or future initiatives will not adversely affect our ability to access and use data or to develop or market current or future services 

data protection privacy and similar laws protect more than patient information and although they vary by jurisdiction these laws can extend to employee information business contact information provider information and other information relating to identifiable individuals failure to comply with these laws may result in among other things civil and criminal liability negative publicity damage to our reputation and liability under contractual provisions in addition compliance with such laws may require increased costs to us or may dictate that we not offer certain types of services 

the occurrence of any of the foregoing could impact our ability to provide the same level of service to our clients require us to modify our offerings or increase our costs which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition

our success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 

our success depends in part upon our ability to develop use and protect our proprietary methodologies analytics systems technologies and other intellectual property existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights and the protection in some countries may be very limited we rely upon a combination of trade secrets confidentiality policies nondisclosure invention assignment and other contractual arrangements and patent copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights these laws are subject to change at any time and certain agreements may not be fully enforceable which could further restrict our ability to protect our innovations our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing services similar to or duplicative of ours further the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors former employees or other third parties and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 

 

  our ability to obtain protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation or thirdparty opposition risks as well as the uncertainty as to the scope of protection registrability patentability validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights in each applicable country governments may adopt regulations and government agencies or courts may render decisions requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property rights when we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights we may be subject to claims that the intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our confidential and proprietary information litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly time consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property rights furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management’s attention and resources could delay further sales or the implementation of our solutions impair the functionality of our solutions delay introductions of new solutions result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our solutions or injure our reputation and harm our operating results and financial condition 

depending on the circumstances we might need to grant a specific client greater rights in intellectual property developed in connection with a contract than we otherwise generally do in certain situations we might forego all rights to the use of intellectual property we create which would limit our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other clients any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenuegenerating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop or license new or modified solutions for future projects 

the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could reduce the differentiation of our services and harm our business the value of our investment in development or business acquisitions could be reduced and third parties might make claims against us related to losses of their confidential or proprietary information in addition we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights these incidents and claims could harm our business reduce revenue increase expenses and harm our reputation 

we may be subject to claims by others that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights 

third parties may assert claims that we or our clients infringe their intellectual property rights and these claims with or without merit could be expensive to litigate cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management resources and attention in defending the claim in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can also seek injunctive relief that may limit the operation of our business or prevent the marketing and selling of our services that infringe on the plaintiff’s intellectual property rights to resolve these claims we may enter into licensing agreements with restrictive terms or significant fees stop selling be required to implement costly redesigns to the affected services or pay damages to satisfy contractual obligations to others if we do not resolve these claims in advance of a trial there is no guarantee that we will be successful in court these outcomes may have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition certain contracts with our suppliers or clients contain provisions whereby we indemnify subject to certain limitations the counterparty for damages suffered as a result of claims related to intellectual property infringement and the use of our data claims made under these provisions could be expensive to litigate and could result in significant payments 

  we rely on licenses from third parties to certain technology and intellectual property rights for some of our services and the licenses we currently have could terminate or expire 

some of our business services rely on technology or intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others our licenses to this technology or these intellectual property rights could be terminated or could expire we may be unable to replace these licenses in a timely manner failure to renew these licenses or renewals of these licenses on less advantageous terms could harm our operating results and financial condition 

 

our financial results may be adversely affected if we underprice our contracts overrun our cost estimates or fail to receive approval for or experience delays in documenting change orders 

most of our research  development solutions contracts are either fee for service contracts or fixedfee contracts our past financial results have been and our future financial results may be adversely impacted if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates and are unable to successfully negotiate a change order change orders typically occur when the scope of work we perform needs to be modified from that originally contemplated by our contract with the client modifications can occur for example when there is a change in a key clinical trial assumption or parameter or a significant change in timing where we are not successful in converting outofscope work into change orders under our current contracts we bear the cost of the additional work such underpricing significant cost overruns or delay in documentation of change orders could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

the relationship of backlog to revenues varies over time 

backlog represents future revenues for our research  development solutions business from work not yet completed or performed under signed binding commitments and signed contracts once work begins on a project revenue is recognized over the duration of the project projects may be terminated or delayed by the client or delayed by regulatory authorities for reasons beyond our control to the extent projects are delayed the timing of our revenue could be affected in the event that a client cancels a contract we typically would be entitled to receive payment for all services performed up to the cancellation date and subsequent clientauthorized services related to terminating the canceled project typically however we have no contractual right to the full amount of the revenue reflected in our backlog in the event of a contract cancellation the duration of the projects included in our backlog and the related revenue recognition range from a few weeks to many years our backlog may not be indicative of our future revenues from our research  development solutions business and we may not realize all the anticipated future revenue reflected in our backlog a number of factors may affect backlog including 









although an increase in backlog will generally result in an increase in revenues to be recognized over time depending on the level of cancellations an increase in backlog at a particular point in time does not necessarily correspond directly to an increase in revenues during a particular period the extent to which contracts in backlog will result in revenue depends on many factors including but not limited to delivery against projected schedules the need for scope changes change orders contract cancellations and the nature duration size complexity and phase of the contracts each of which factors can vary significantly from time to time 

the rate at which our backlog converts to revenue may vary over time for a variety of reasons the revenue recognition on larger more global projects could be slower than on smaller less global projects for a variety of reasons including but not limited to an extended period of negotiation between the time the project is awarded to us and the actual execution of the contract as well as an increased timeframe for obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals additionally the increased complexity of clinical trials and the need to enroll precise patient populations could extend the length of clinical trials causing revenue to be recognized over a longer period of time further delayed projects will remain in backlog unless otherwise canceled by the client and will not generate revenue at the rate originally expected thus the relationship of backlog to realized revenues may vary over time 

 

our business depends on the continued effectiveness and availability of our information systems including the information systems we use to provide our services to our clients and failures of these systems may materially limit our operations 

due to the global nature of our business and our reliance on information systems to provide our services we intend to increase our use of webenabled and other integrated information systems in delivering our services we also provide access to similar information systems to certain of our clients in connection with the services we provide them as the breadth and complexity of our information systems continue to grow we will increasingly be exposed to the risks inherent in the development integration and ongoing operation of evolving information systems including 







the materialization of any of these risks may impede the processing of data the delivery of databases and services and the daytoday management of our business and could result in the corruption loss or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary confidential or other data while we have disaster recovery plans in place they might not adequately protect us in the event of a system failure while many of our operations have disaster recovery plans in place we currently do not have excess or standby computer processing or network capacity everywhere in the world to avoid disruption in the receipt processing and delivery of data in the event of a system failure despite any precautions we take damage from fire floods hurricanes power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses breakins and similar events at our various computer facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to our servers and from our servers to our clients corruption or loss of data may result in the need to repeat a clinical trial at no cost to the client but at significant cost to us the termination of a contract or damage to our reputation 

in addition any failure by our computer environment to provide sufficient processing or network capacity to transfer data could result in interruptions in our service in the event of a delay in the delivery of data we could be required to transfer our data collection operations to an alternative provider of server hosting services such a transfer could result in significant delays in our ability to deliver services to our clients and increase our costs additionally significant delays in system enhancements or inadequate performance of new or upgraded systems once completed could damage our reputation and harm our business finally longterm disruptions in the infrastructure caused by events such as natural disasters the outbreak of war the escalation of hostilities and acts of terrorism particularly involving cities in which we have offices could adversely affect our businesses although we carry property and business interruption insurance our coverage might not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur 

we have continued to undertake significant programs to optimize business processes with respect to our services our inability to effectively manage the implementation and adapt to new processes designed into new or upgraded systems in a timely and costeffective manner may result in disruption to our business and negatively affect our operations   

we have entered into agreements with certain vendors to provide systems development and integration services that develop or license to us the it platform for programs to optimize our business processes if such vendors fail to perform as required or if there are substantial delays in developing implementing and updating the it platform our client delivery may be impaired and we may have to make substantial further investments internally or with third parties to achieve our objectives additionally our progress may be limited by parties with existing or claimed patents who seek to enjoin us from using preferred technology or seek license payments from us meeting our objectives is dependent on a number of factors which may not take place as we anticipate including obtaining adequate technologyenabled services creating itenabled services that our clients will find desirable and implementing our business model with respect to these services also increased itrelated expenditures may negatively impact our profitability 

 

we may experience challenges with the acquisition development enhancement or deployment of technology necessary for our business 

we operate in businesses that require sophisticated computer systems and software for data collection data processing cloudbased platforms analytics cryptography statistical projections and forecasting mobile computing social media analytics and other applications and technologies particularly our commercial solutions business we seek to address our technology risks by increasing our reliance on the use of innovations by crossindustry technology leaders and adapt these for our biopharmaceutical and healthcare industry clients some of these technologies supporting the industries we serve are changing rapidly and we must continue to adapt to these changes in a timely and effective manner at an acceptable cost we also must continue to deliver data to our clients in forms that are easy to use while simultaneously providing clear answers to complex questions there can be no guarantee that we will be able to develop acquire or integrate new technologies that these new technologies will meet our clients’ needs or achieve expected investment goals or that we will be able to do so as quickly or costeffectively as our competitors significant technological change could render certain of our services obsolete moreover the introduction of new services embodying new technologies could render certain of our existing services obsolete our continued success will depend on our ability to adapt to changing technologies manage and process everincreasing amounts of data and information and improve the performance features and reliability of our services in response to changing client and industry demands we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful design development testing introduction or marketing of our services new services or enhancements to existing services may not adequately meet the requirements of current and prospective clients or achieve any degree of significant market acceptance these types of failures could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

consolidation in the industries in which our clients operate may reduce the volume of services purchased by consolidated clients following an acquisition or merger which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 

mergers or consolidations among our clients have in the past and could in the future reduce the number of our clients and potential clients when companies consolidate overlapping services previously purchased separately are usually purchased only once by the combined entity leading to loss of revenue other services that were previously purchased by one of the merged or consolidated entities may be deemed unnecessary or cancelled if our clients merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services there can be no assurance as to the degree to which we may be able to address the revenue impact of such consolidation any of these developments could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by client or therapeutic concentration 

although we did not have any client that represented 10 or more of our revenues in 2017 2016 and 2015 we derive the majority of our revenues from a number of large clients if any large client decreases or terminates its relationship with us our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected   

additionally conducting multiple clinical trials for different clients in a single therapeutic class involving drugs with the same or similar chemical action has in the past and may in the future adversely affect our business if some or all of the clinical trials are canceled because of new scientific information or regulatory judgments that affect the drugs as a class or if industry consolidation results in the rationalization of drug development pipelines similarly marketing and selling drugs for different biopharmaceutical companies with similar chemical actions subjects us to risk if new scientific information or regulatory judgment prejudices the drugs as a class which may lead to compelled or voluntary prescription limitations or withdrawal of some or all of such drugs from the market 

 

our business is subject to international economic political and other risks that could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we have significant operations in countries that may require complex arrangements to deliver services throughout the world for our clients additionally we have established operations in locations remote from our most developed business centers as a result we are subject to heightened risks inherent in conducting business internationally including the following 





















these risks and uncertainties could negatively impact our ability to among other things perform large global projects for our clients furthermore our ability to deal with these issues could be affected by applicable united states laws and the need to protect our assets any such risks could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

exchange rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial condition 

because a large portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar and our financial statements are reported in united states dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition exchange rate fluctuations between local currencies and the united states dollar create risk in several ways including 





we may limit these risks through exchange rate fluctuation provisions stated in our service contracts or we may hedge our transaction risk with foreign currency exchange contracts or options we have not however hedged all of our foreign currency transaction risk and we may experience fluctuations in financial results from our operations outside the united states and foreign currency transaction risk associated with our service contracts 

due to the global nature of our business we may be exposed to liabilities under anticorruption laws including the united states foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and various international anticorruption laws and any allegation or determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are required to comply with the fcpa the uk bribery act and other international anticorruption laws which prohibit companies from engaging in bribery including corruptly or improperly offering promising or providing money or anything else of value to nonunited states officials and certain other recipients in addition the fcpa imposes certain books records and accounting control obligations on public companies and other issuers we operate in parts of the world in which corruption can be common and compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices our global operations face the risk of unauthorized payments or offers being made by employees consultants sales agents and other business partners outside of our control or without our authorization it is our policy to implement safeguards to prohibit these practices by our employees and business partners with respect to our operations however irrespective of these safeguards or as a result of monitoring compliance with such safeguards it is possible that we or certain other parties may discover or receive information at some point that certain employees consultants sales agents or other business partners may have engaged in corrupt conduct for which we might be held responsible violations of the fcpa the uk bribery act or other international anticorruption laws may result in restatements of or irregularities in our financial statements as well as severe criminal or civil sanctions and we may be subject to other liabilities which could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition in some cases companies that violate the fcpa may be debarred by the united states government andor lose their united states export privileges changes in anticorruption laws or enforcement priorities could also result in increased compliance requirements and related costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition the united states or other governments may seek to hold us liable for successor liability fcpa violations or violations of other anticorruption laws committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquired or will acquire 

we face risks related to sales to government entities 

we derive a portion of our revenue from sales to government entities in the united states in general our contracts with united states government entities are terminable at will by the government entity at any time government demand and payment for our services may be affected by publicsector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations including government shutdowns government contracts are subject to oversight including special rules on accounting expenses reviews and security failure to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions including termination of contracts fines and suspensions or debarment from future business with the united states government as a result failure to comply with these rules could have an adverse effect on our future business reputation operating results and financial condition 

 

if we are unable to successfully develop and market new services or enter new markets our growth results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

a key element of our growth strategy is the successful development and marketing of new services or entering new markets that complement or expand our existing business as we develop new services or enter new markets including services targeted at participants in the broader healthcare industry we may not have or adequately build the competencies necessary to perform such services satisfactorily may not receive market acceptance for such services or may face increased competition if we are unable to succeed in developing new services entering new markets or attracting a client base for our new services or in new markets we will be unable to implement this element of our growth strategy and our future business reputation results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our research  development solutions business could subject us to potential liability that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our research  development solutions business involves the testing of new drugs on patients in clinical trials and if marketing approval is granted the availability of these drugs to be prescribed to patients our involvement in the clinical trials and development process creates a risk of liability for personal injury to or death of patients particularly those with lifethreatening illnesses resulting from adverse reactions to the drugs administered during testing or after product launch respectively for example we have from time to time been sued and may be sued in the future by individuals alleging personal injury due to their participation in clinical trials and seeking damages from us under a variety of legal theories although we maintain the types and amounts of insurance we view as customary in the industries and countries in which we operate if we are required to pay damages or incur defense costs in connection with any personal injury claim that is outside the scope of indemnification agreements we have with our clients if any indemnification agreement is not performed in accordance with its terms or if our liability exceeds the amount of any applicable indemnification limits or available insurance coverage our financial condition results of operations and reputation could be materially and adversely affected we maintain professional liability insurance including liability for completed operations coverage in the future we may not be able to get adequate insurance for these types of risks at reasonable rates 

we also contract with physicians to serve as investigators in conducting clinical trials if the investigators commit errors or make omissions during a clinical trial that result in harm to clinical trial patients or after a clinical trial to a patient using the drug after it has received regulatory approval claims for personal injury or liability damages may result additionally if the investigators engage in fraudulent behavior clinical trial data may be compromised which may require us to repeat the clinical trial or subject us to liability we do not believe we are legally responsible for the medical care rendered by such thirdparty investigators and we would vigorously defend any claims brought against us however it is possible we could be found liable for claims with respect to the actions of thirdparty investigators which may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

some of our research  development solutions services involve direct interaction with clinical trial subjects or volunteers and operation of phase i clinical facilities which could create potential liability that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we operate facilities where phase i clinical trials are conducted which ordinarily involve testing an investigational drug on a limited number of healthy individuals typically 20 to 80 persons to determine such drug’s basic safety failure to operate such a facility in accordance with applicable regulations could result in that facility being shut down which could disrupt our operations additionally we face risks associated with adverse events resulting from the administration of such drugs to healthy volunteers and the professional malpractice of medical care providers occasionally physicians employed at our phase i clinical facilities act as principal investigators in laterphase clinical trials at those same facilities we also directly employ nurses and other trained employees who assist in implementing the testing involved in our clinical trials such as drawing blood from healthy volunteers any professional malpractice or negligence by such investigators nurses or other employees could potentially result in liability to us in the event of personal injury to or death of a healthy volunteer in clinical trials this liability particularly if it were to exceed the limits of any indemnification agreements and insurance coverage we may have may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

 

our integrated engagement services business could result in liability to us if a drug causes harm to a patient while we are generally indemnified and insured against such risks we may still suffer financial losses 

when we market drugs under contract for a biopharmaceutical company we could suffer liability for harm allegedly caused by those drugs either as a result of a lawsuit against the biopharmaceutical company to which we are joined a lawsuit naming us or any of our subsidiaries or an action launched by a regulatory body while we are generally indemnified by the biopharmaceutical company for the action of the drugs we market on its behalf and we carry insurance to cover harm caused by our negligence in performing services it is possible that we could nonetheless incur financial losses regulatory penalties or both in particular any claim could result in potential liability for us if the claim is outside the scope of the indemnification agreement we have with the biopharmaceutical company the biopharmaceutical company does not abide by the indemnification agreement as required or the liability exceeds the amount of any applicable indemnification limits or available insurance coverage such a finding could have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and reputation furthermore negative publicity associated with harm caused by drugs we helped to market could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

our insurance may not cover all of our indemnification obligations and other liabilities associated with our operations 

we maintain insurance designed to provide coverage for ordinary risks associated with our operations and our ordinary indemnification obligations the coverage provided by such insurance may not be adequate for all claims we may make or may be contested by our insurance carriers if our insurance is not adequate or available to pay liabilities associated with our operations or if we are unable to purchase adequate insurance at reasonable rates in the future our profitability may be adversely impacted 

if we are unable to attract suitable investigators and patients for our clinical trials our clinical development business might suffer 

the timely recruitment of investigators and patients for clinical trials is essential to our research  development solutions business investigators are typically located at hospitals clinics or other sites and supervise the administration of the investigational drug to patients during the course of a clinical trial patients generally include people from the communities in which the clinical trials are conducted our clinical development business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract suitable and willing investigators or patients for clinical trials on a consistent basis for example if we are unable to engage investigators to conduct clinical trials as planned or enroll sufficient patients in clinical trials we might need to expend additional funds to obtain access to resources or else be compelled to delay or modify the clinical trial plans which may result in additional costs to us 

if we lose the services of key personnel or are unable to recruit additional qualified personnel our business could be adversely affected 

our success substantially depends on the collective performance contributions and expertise of our personnel including senior management and key personnel qualified professional scientific and technical operating staff and qualified sales representatives for our contract sales services there is significant and increasing competition for qualified personnel particularly those with higher educational degrees such as a medical degree a phd or an equivalent degree or relevant experience in the industry and in the locations in which we operate in addition the departure of our key employees or our inability to continue to identify attract and retain qualified personnel or replace any departed personnel in a timely fashion may impact our ability to grow our business and compete effectively in our industry and may negatively affect our ability to meet financial and operational goals 

disruptions in the credit and capital markets and unfavorable general economic conditions could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

disruptions in the credit and capital markets could have negative effects on our business that may be difficult to predict or anticipate including the ability of our clients vendors contractors and financing sources to meet their contractual obligations although we are unable to quantify the impact it has had on us we are aware of a limited number of instances in our research  development solutions business during the past several years where cancellations changes in scope and failure to pay timely were attributable at least in part to difficulty in our clients’ ability to obtain financing in the future such actions by our clients could if they involve a significant amount of business with us have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

our effective income tax rate may fluctuate for a variety of reasons including the tax cuts and jobs act enacted in 2017 the “tax act” which may adversely affect our operations earnings and earnings per share 

our effective income tax rate is influenced by our projected profitability in the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate changes in a jurisdiction’s income tax rates and the distribution of our profits and losses among such jurisdictions may have a significant impact on our effective income tax rate which in turn could have an adverse effect on our net income and earnings per share factors that may affect our effective income tax rate include but are not limited to 















in addition our effective income tax rate is influenced by us tax law which has been substantially modified by the tax act the following provisions of the tax act could have an adverse effect on our tax rate if it is determined that the provisions are applicable to us

• antibase erosion and profit shifting 

• global intangible lowtaxed income 

• deduction for net business interest limited to 30 of adjusted taxable income and

• performancebased compensation and commissions now subject to 1 million limit 

all of these items described above may cause fluctuations in our effective income tax rate through increased us tax liability andor the loss of tax attributes in any given year that could adversely affect our results of operations and impact our earnings and earnings per share additional information regarding our income taxes is presented in note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” including asc 606 “revenue from contracts with customers” asc 606 or other standardsetting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements

we are required to prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” which is periodically revised andor expanded from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the fasb and the sec it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt such as amended guidance for leases may require additional changes to the current accounting treatment that we apply to our financial statements and may require us to make significant changes to our reporting systems such changes could result in a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition

for example effective january 1 2018 we were required to adopt asc 606 under this new standard the company is required to recognize revenue for its clinical trial arrangements on a percentage of completion basis this change in revenue recognition requires significant estimates of project costs that will need to be updated and adjusted on a regular basis these updates and adjustments are likely to result in variability in our revenue recognition from period to period that may cause unexpected variability in our operating results see note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for details regarding asc 606 

 

our relationships with existing or potential clients who are in competition with each other may adversely impact the degree to which other clients or potential clients use our services which may adversely affect our results of operations 

the biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive with biopharmaceutical companies each seeking to persuade payers providers and patients that their drug therapies are better and more costeffective than competing therapies marketed or being developed by competing firms in addition to the adverse competitive interests that biopharmaceutical companies have with each other biopharmaceutical companies also have adverse interests with respect to drug selection and reimbursement with other participants in the healthcare industry including payers and providers biopharmaceutical companies also compete to be first to market with new drug therapies we regularly provide services to biopharmaceutical companies who compete with each other and we sometimes provide services or funding to such clients regarding competing drugs in development our existing or future relationships with our biopharmaceutical clients may therefore deter other biopharmaceutical clients from using our services or may result in our clients seeking to place limits on our ability to serve other biopharmaceutical industry participants in connection with drug development activities in addition our further expansion into the broader healthcare market may adversely impact our relationships with biopharmaceutical clients and such clients may elect not to use our services reduce the scope of services that we provide to them or seek to place restrictions on our ability to serve clients in the broader healthcare market with interests that are adverse to theirs a loss of clients or reductions in the level of revenues from a client could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations business and prospects 

if we are unable to successfully identify acquire and integrate existing businesses services and technologies our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 

we anticipate that a portion of our future growth may come from acquiring existing businesses services or technologies the success of any acquisition will depend upon among other things our ability to effectively integrate acquired personnel operations services and technologies into our business and to retain the key personnel and clients of our acquired businesses in addition we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or obtain any necessary financing on commercially acceptable terms we may also spend time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition targets but not complete the transaction any future acquisition could involve other risks including among others the assumption of additional liabilities and expenses difficulties and expenses in connection with integrating the acquired companies and achieving the expected benefits issuances of potentially dilutive securities or interestbearing debt loss of key employees of the acquired companies transaction costs diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and with respect to the acquisition of foreign companies the inability to overcome differences in foreign business practices language and customs our failure to identify potential acquisitions complete targeted acquisitions and integrate completed acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

investments in our clients’ businesses or drugs and our related commercial rights strategies could have a negative impact on our financial performance 

we may enter into arrangements with our clients or other drug companies in which we take on some of the risk of the potential success or failure of their businesses or drugs including making strategic investments in our clients or other drug companies providing financing to clients or other drug companies or acquiring an interest in the revenues from clients’ drugs or in entities developing a limited number of drugs our financial results would be adversely affected if these investments or the underlying drugs result in losses or do not achieve the level of success that we anticipate andor our return or payment from the drug investment or financing is less than our direct and indirect costs with respect to these arrangements 

  our results of operations may be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our goodwill and intangible assets 

we assess the realizability of our indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill annually and conduct an interim evaluation whenever events or changes in circumstances such as operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset indicate that these assets may be impaired for example we recognized 40 million of impairment losses during the year ended december 31 2017 for goodwill and intangible assets in encore health resources llc “encore” which we sold in the third quarter of 2017 our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of the businesses we have acquired which in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses into our own business if we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets such impairment charges could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

 

we face risks arising from the restructuring of our operations 

from time to time we have adopted restructuring plans to improve our operating efficiency through various means such as reduction of overcapacity elimination of nonbillable support roles or other realignment of resources restructuring presents significant potential risks of events occurring that could adversely affect us including 











further any such restructuring would result in charges that if material could harm our results of operations and significantly reduce our cash position or increase debt in addition we may incur certain unforeseen costs once any restructuring activities are implemented further if we determine to effect any restructuring we can give no assurance that any projected cost reductions resulting from such restructuring activities will be achieved within the expected timeframe or at all 

because of these and other factors we cannot predict whether we will realize the purpose and anticipated benefits of these measures and if we do not our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

additionally there may be delays in implementing the restructuring activities or a failure to achieve the anticipated levels of cost savings and efficiency as a result of the restructuring activities each of which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations further restructuring or reorganization activities may also be required in the future beyond what is currently planned which could further enhance the risks associated with these activities 

risks relating to our industry 

the biopharmaceutical services industry is highly competitive 

the biopharmaceutical services industry is highly competitive our business often competes with other biopharmaceutical services companies internal discovery departments development departments sales and marketing departments information technology departments and other departments within our clients some of which could be considered large biopharmaceutical services companies in their own right with greater resources than ours we also compete with universities teaching hospitals governments agencies and others if we do not compete successfully our business will suffer the industry is highly fragmented with numerous smaller specialized companies and a handful of companies with global capabilities similar to certain of our own capabilities increased competition has led to price and other forms of competition such as acceptance of less favorable contract terms that could adversely affect our operating results there are few barriers to entry for companies considering offering any one or more of the services we offer because of their size and focus these companies might compete effectively against us which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our future growth and success will depend on our ability to successfully compete with other companies that provide similar services in the same markets some of which may have financial marketing technical and other advantages we also expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of consolidation among these various companies large technology companies with substantial resources technical expertise and greater brand power could also decide to enter or further expand in the markets where our business operates and compete with us if one or more of our competitors or potential competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors or if a new entrant emerged with substantial resources the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively we compete on the basis of various factors including breadth and depth of services reputation reliability quality innovation security price and industry expertise and experience in addition our ability to compete successfully may be impacted by the growing availability of health information from social media government health information systems and other free or lowcost sources consolidation or integration of wholesalers retail pharmacies health networks payers or other healthcare stakeholders may lead any of them to provide information services directly to clients or indirectly through a designated service provider resulting in increased competition from firms that may have lower costs to market eg no data supply costs any of the above may result in lower demand for our services which could result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

 

outsourcing trends in the biopharmaceutical industry and changes in aggregate spending and research and development budgets could adversely affect our operating results and growth rate 

economic factors and industry trends that affect biopharmaceutical companies affect our research  development solutions business biopharmaceutical companies continue to seek longterm strategic collaborations with global contract research organizations with favorable pricing terms competition for these collaborations is intense and we may decide to forego an opportunity or we may not be selected in which case a competitor may enter into the collaboration and our business with the client if any may be limited in addition if the biopharmaceutical industry reduces its research  development solutions activities or reduces its outsourcing of clinical trials and sales and marketing projects or such outsourcing fails to grow at projected rates our operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected we may also be negatively impacted by consolidation and other factors in the biopharmaceutical industry which may slow decision making by our clients or result in the delay or cancellation of clinical trials our commercial services may be affected by reductions in new drug launches and increases in the number of drugs losing patent protection all of these events could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our business may be materially and adversely impacted by factors affecting the biopharmaceutical and healthcare industries 

the vast majority of our revenue is generated from sales to the biopharmaceutical and healthcare industries the clients we serve in these industries are commonly subject to financial pressures including but not limited to increased costs reduced demand for their products reductions in pricing and reimbursement for products and services formulary approval and placement government approval to market their products and limits on the manner by which they market their products loss of patent exclusivity whether due to patent expiration or as a result of a successful legal challenge and the proliferation of or changes to regulations applicable to these industries to the extent our clients face such pressures or they change how they utilize our offerings the demand for our services or the prices our clients are willing to pay for those services may decline any such decline could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we may be affected by healthcare reform and potential additional reforms 

the united states congress continues to consider healthcare reform legislation and impose health industry cost containment measures which may significantly impact the biopharmaceutical industry in addition numerous government bodies are considering or have adopted various healthcare reforms and may undertake or are in the process of undertaking efforts to control growing healthcare costs through legislation regulation and voluntary agreements with medical care providers and biopharmaceutical companies we are uncertain as to the effects of these recent reforms on our business and are unable to predict what legislative proposals if any will be adopted in the future if regulatory cost containment efforts limit the profitability of new drugs our clients may reduce their research and development spending or promotional marketing and sales expenditures which could reduce the business they outsource to us similarly if regulatory requirements are relaxed or simplified drug approval procedures are adopted the demand for our services could decrease 

foreign and domestic government bodies may also adopt healthcare legislation or regulations that are more burdensome than existing regulations for example product safety concerns and recommendations by the drug safety oversight board could change the regulatory environment for drug products and new or heightened regulatory and licensing requirements may increase our expenses or limit or delay our ability to offer some of our services additionally new or heightened regulatory requirements may have a negative impact on the ability of our clients to conduct industrysponsored clinical trials which could reduce the need for our services 

actions by government regulators or clients to limit a prescription’s scope or withdraw an approved drug from the market could adversely affect our business and result in a loss of revenues 

government regulators have the authority after approving a drug to regulate or limit its scope of prescription or withdraw it from the market completely based on safety concerns similarly clients may act to voluntarily limit the scope of prescription of drugs or withdraw them from the market in the past we have provided services with respect to drugs that have been limited andor withdrawn if we are providing services to clients for drugs that are limited or withdrawn we may be required to narrow the scope of or terminate our services with respect to such drugs which would prevent earning the full amount of revenues anticipated under the related service contracts with negative impacts to our financial results 

 

if we do not keep pace with rapid technological changes our services may become less competitive or obsolete 

the biopharmaceutical industry is subject to rapid technological changes our current competitors or other businesses might develop technologies or services that are more effective or commercially attractive than or render obsolete our current or future technologies and services if our competitors introduce superior technologies or services and if we cannot make enhancements to remain competitive our competitive position would be harmed if we are unable to compete successfully we may lose clients or be unable to attract new clients which could lead to a decrease in our revenue and financial condition 

laws restricting biopharmaceutical sales and marketing practices may adversely impact demand for our services 

there have been a significant number of laws legislative initiatives and regulatory actions over the years that seek to limit biopharmaceutical sales and marketing practices for example three states in 2006 and 2007 passed laws restricting the use of prescriber identifiable information for the purpose of promoting branded prescription medicines although these laws were subsequently declared to be unconstitutional based on a decision of the us supreme court in sorrell v ims health in 2011 we are unable to predict whether and in what form other initiatives may be introduced or actions taken at the state or federal levels to limit biopharmaceutical sales and marketing practices in addition while we will continue to seek to adapt our services to comply with the requirements of these laws to the extent applicable to our services if enacted there can be no assurance that our efforts to adapt our offerings will be successful and provide the same financial contribution to us there can also be no assurance that future legislative initiatives will not adversely affect our ability to develop or market current or future offerings or that any future laws will not diminish the demand for our services all of which could over time result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

our research  development solutions clients face intense competition from lower cost generic products which may lower the amount that they spend on our services 

our research  development solutions clients face increasing competition from lower cost generic products which in turn may affect their ability to pursue research and development activities with us in the united states eu and japan political pressure to reduce spending on prescription drugs has led to legislation and other measures which encourages the use of generic products in addition proposals emerge from time to time in the united states and other countries for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by generic substitutes reducing our clients’ sales of that product and their overall profitability availability of generic substitutes for our clients’ drugs may adversely affect their results of operations and cash flow which in turn may mean that they would not have surplus capital to invest in research and development and drug commercialization including in our services if competition from generic products impacts our clients’ finances such that they decide to curtail our services our revenues may decline and this could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

risks relating to our indebtedness 

restrictions imposed in the senior secured credit facilities and other outstanding indebtedness including the indentures governing iqvia holdings inc outstanding notes may limit our ability to operate our business and to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 

the terms of the senior secured credit facilities restrict iqvia and its restricted subsidiaries from engaging in specified types of transactions these covenants restrict the ability of iqvia and its restricted subsidiaries among other things to 

























in addition the revolving credit facility and the new term loans under our senior secured credit facility require iqvia to comply with a quarterly maximum senior secured net leverage ratio test and minimum interest coverage ratio test iqvia’s ability to comply with these financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and iqvia may not be able to satisfy them additionally the restrictions contained in the indentures governing the outstanding notes could also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions meet capital needs or make acquisitions or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facilities or the indentures governing the outstanding notes which could trigger acceleration of our indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of or default under any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial results in the event of any default under the senior secured credit facilities the applicable lenders could elect to terminate borrowing commitments and declare all borrowings and loans outstanding together with accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and other obligations to be due and payable in addition or in the alternative the applicable lenders could exercise their rights under the security documents entered into in connection with the senior secured credit facilities iqvia and the other subsidiary guarantors have pledged substantially all of their tangible and intangible assets subject to customary exceptions as collateral under the senior secured credit facilities including the stock and the assets of certain of our current and future wholly owned united states subsidiaries and a portion of the stock of certain of our nonunited states subsidiaries 

if we were unable to repay or otherwise refinance these borrowings and loans when due the applicable lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation in the event the applicable lenders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness any acceleration of amounts due under the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities or the exercise by the applicable lenders of their rights under the security documents would likely have a material adverse effect on us 

 

despite our level of indebtedness we are able to incur more debt and undertake additional obligations incurring such debt or undertaking such additional obligations could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition 

although our credit agreement which governs the senior credit facilities of our wholly owned subsidiary through which we conduct our operations iqvia inc “opco” contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could increase in addition the receivables financing agreement for our special purpose subsidiary iqvia funding llc “iqvia funding” limits borrowing based on the amount of receivables purchased by iqvia funding from certain of our other subsidiaries but when supported by the value of such purchased receivables the debt under our receivables financing facility can increase 

while the credit agreement also contains restrictions on our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to make loans and investments these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the investments incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial   

restrictive covenants in our other indebtedness may limit our flexibility in our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to pursue our business strategies 

the terms contained in certain of our indebtedness including credit facilities and any future indebtedness of ours may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions including restrictions on our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to take actions that we believe may be in our interest these agreements among other things limit our ability to 

























a breach of the covenants or restrictions under the agreements governing our other indebtedness could result in a default under the applicable indebtedness such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in the event our lenders and noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we cannot assure that we and our subsidiaries would have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness 

our financial results our substantial indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of future financing 

 

interest rate fluctuations and our ability to deduct interest expense may affect our results of operations and financial condition 

because we have variable rate debt fluctuations in interest rates affect our business we attempt to minimize interest rate risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate caps and swaps we have entered into interest rate caps and swaps with financial institutions that have reset dates and critical terms that match those of our senior secured term loan credit facility accordingly any change in market value associated with the interest rate caps and swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt because we do not attempt to hedge all of our variable rate debt we may incur higher interest costs for the portion of our variable rate debt which is not hedged 

in addition the deduction for our interest expense may be limited which could have an adverse impact on our taxes and net income 

risks relating to ownership of our common stock 

the parties to the shareholders agreement continue to have significant influence over us including control over decisions that require the approval of stockholders which could limit the ability of other stockholders to influence the outcome of matters submitted to stockholders for a vote 

as of february 12 2018 certain parties to a shareholders agreement dated may 3 2016 the “shareholders agreement” own approximately 249 of the outstanding shares of our common stock

the parties to the shareholders agreement other than dr dennis gillings and certain of his affiliates the “dg shareholders” who have agreed separately to vote in favor of the merger and the transactions contemplated thereby have agreed to vote for individuals designated to the company’s board of directors as follows 













the shareholders agreement provides that we will use our best efforts to cause dr gillings to be elected as the lead director through our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders and to be elected as a director so that he may serve as a director until the day after our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders provided that the dg shareholders as a group continue to beneficially own at least 25 of our outstanding common stock including using its best efforts to support his nomination for the slate of director nominees for a threeyear term at our 2020 annual meetings of stockholders 

in 2017 the lgp shareholders and the tpg shareholders each ceased having the right to appoint one director to the board following the secondary offering that closed on september 19 2017 the lgp shareholders holdings of our outstanding common stock fell below 25 following the secondary offering that closed on november 30 2017 the tpg shareholders holdings of our outstanding common stock fell below 12 as a result pursuant to the shareholders agreement mr danhakl offered to tender his resignation and the tpg shareholders offered to tender the resignation of one of its two representatives on the board the tpg shareholders continue to have the right to appoint one remaining director to the board after review the nominating and governance committee of the board declined the offers made by mr danhakl and the tpg shareholders

 

even though the lgp shareholders and the tpg shareholders each lost the right to appoint one director to the board the parties to the shareholders agreement potentially still have the ability to influence decisions of our company to enter into any corporate transaction and the terms thereof any change in the composition of our board of directors and any transaction that requires stockholder approval regardless of whether others believe that such change or transaction is in the best interests of our company additionally the parties to the shareholders agreement are in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us one or more of the parties to the shareholders agreement may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our businesses and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us so long as the parties to the shareholders agreement continue to own a significant amount of our equity if they exercise their stockholder rights collectively they will be able to significantly influence our decisions   

provisions of the corporate governance documents of iqvia could make an acquisition of iqvia difficult and may prevent attempts by its stockholders to replace or remove its management even if beneficial to its stockholders 

in addition to the beneficial ownership of a large percentage of iqvia common stock by the parties to the shareholders agreement our certificate of incorporation and delaware bylaws and the general corporation law of delaware “dgcl” contain provisions that could make it difficult for a third party to acquire iqvia even if doing so might be beneficial to its stockholders including 















in addition iqvia is subject to section 203 of the dgcl regulating corporate takeovers although our board of directors adopted a resolution approving the merger pursuant to which shares of common stock were acquired by among others the tpg shareholders section 203 subject to certain exceptions prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any “business combination” with any “interested stockholder” for a period of three years following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder unless 







 

in general section 203 defines “business combination” to include mergers or consolidations between a delaware corporation and an interested stockholder transactions with an interested stockholder involving the assets or stock of the corporation or its majorityowned subsidiaries and transactions which increase an interested stockholder’s percentage ownership of stock in general section 203 defines an “interested stockholder” as any entity or person beneficially owning 15 or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by stockholders to replace members of the board of directors because iqvia’s board is responsible for appointing the members of management these provisions could in turn affect any attempt to replace current members of management as a result stockholders of iqvia may lose their ability to sell their stock for a price in excess of the prevailing market price due to these protective measures and efforts by stockholders to change the direction or management of iqvia may be unsuccessful 

our operating results and share price may be volatile which could cause the value of our stockholders’ investments to decline 

our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future and such fluctuations may be significant in addition securities markets worldwide have experienced and are likely to continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could subject the market price of our shares to wide price fluctuations regardless of our operating performance our operating results and the trading price of our shares may fluctuate in response to various factors including 





















these and other factors many of which are beyond our control may cause our operating results and the market price for our shares to fluctuate substantially while we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares and may otherwise negatively affect the market price and liquidity of our shares in addition in the past when the market price of a stock has been volatile holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock if any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation 

there may be sales of a substantial amount of our common stock by our current stockholders and these sales could cause the price of our common stock to fall 

as of february 12 2018 there were 208251468 shares of common stock outstanding approximately 249 of the outstanding shares of our common stock is held by parties to the shareholders agreement   

sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales will occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for us to raise funds through securities offerings in the future for example as restrictions on resale end the market price of our common stock could decline if the holders of currently restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them 

 

stockholders that are a party to the shareholders agreement may require us to register their shares for resale under the federal securities laws subject to certain requirements under the shareholders agreement we are required to pay the registration expenses associated with the registration of such shares not including the underwriting discounts commissions and transfer taxes registration of those shares would allow those stockholders to immediately resell their shares in the public market any such sales or the anticipation of such sales may cause the market price of our common stock to decline in 2017 the parties to the shareholders agreement sold approximately 472 million shares of our common stock of which we repurchased approximately 197 million shares 

in addition we may use our cash cash generated from operations or dispositions of assets or businesses andor proceeds from any new financing arrangements or issuances of debt or equity securities to repurchase shares including the repurchase of shares from our stockholders that are a party to the shareholders agreement 

since we have no current plans to pay regular cash dividends on our common stock stockholders may not receive any return on investment unless they sell their common stock for a price greater than that which they paid for it 

although we have previously declared dividends to our stockholders prior to our initial public offering in may 2013 we do not currently anticipate paying any regular cash dividends on our common stock any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board and will depend on among other things our results of operations financial condition cash requirements contractual restrictions and other factors that our board may deem relevant in addition our ability to pay dividends is and may be limited by covenants of existing and any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur including under our existing credit facilities therefore any return on investment in our common stock is solely dependent upon the appreciation of the price of our common stock on the open market which may not occur 

our certificate of incorporation contains a provision renouncing any interest and expectancy in certain corporate opportunities identified by certain of our affiliates even if such corporate opportunities are ones that we might reasonably be deemed to have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue 

our certificate of incorporation provides that our company renounces any interest or expectancy in the business opportunities of the tpg shareholders the bain capital cpp investment board private holdings inc “cpp shareholder” and leonard green  partners lp “lgp shareholders” and their affiliates other than our company and our subsidiaries and all of their respective partners principals directors officers members managers managing directors andor employees and each such person will have no obligation to offer us such opportunities this provision applies to these stockholders and associated parties only for so long as a nominee designated by the stockholder under the shareholders agreement continues to serve on the board stockholders are deemed to have notice of and have consented to this provision of our certificate of incorporation 

therefore a director or officer of our company who also serves as a director officer member manager or employee of such stockholders may pursue certain business opportunities including acquisitions that may be complementary to its business and as a result such opportunities may not be available to us these potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on the business financial condition results of operations or prospects of our company if attractive corporate opportunities are allocated by such stockholders to themselves or their other affiliates instead of to us

none 




 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2017 we had approximately 282 offices located in approximately 83 countries our executive headquarters are located adjacent to research triangle park north carolina and in danbury connecticut we own facilities in barcelona spain buenos aires argentina caracas venezuela los ruices venezuela lisbon portugal and bangalore india all of our other offices are leased our properties are geographically distributed to meet our worldwide operating requirements and none of our properties are individually material to our business operations many of our leases have an option to renew and we believe that we will be able to successfully renew expiring leases on terms satisfactory to us we believe that our facilities are adequate for our operations and that suitable additional space will be available if needed 

 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in a variety of legal and tax proceedings claims and litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business these actions may be commenced by various parties including competitors clients current or former employees government agencies or others we record a provision with respect to a proceeding claim or litigation when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated however even in instances where we have recorded an estimated liability we are unable to predict with certainty the final outcome of the matter or whether resolution of the matter will materially affect our operating results financial position or cash flows as additional information becomes available we adjust our assessment and estimates of such liabilities accordingly 

further we routinely enter into agreements with our suppliers to acquire data and with our clients to sell data all in the normal course of business in these agreements we sometimes agree to indemnify and hold harmless the other party for any damages such other party may suffer as a result of potential intellectual property infringement and other claims related to the use of the data we have not accrued liability with respect to these matters as the exposure is considered remote 

based on our review of the latest information available management does not expect the impact of pending legal and tax proceedings claims and litigation either individually or in the aggregate to have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial position or cash flows however one or more unfavorable outcomes in any claim or litigation against us could have a material adverse effect for the period in which it is resolved the following is a summary of the more significant legal matters involving the company 

our whollyowned subsidiary ims government solutions inc is primarily engaged in providing services under contracts with the united states government united states government contracts are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements and from time to time agencies of the united states government have the ability to investigate whether contractors’ operations are being conducted in accordance with such requirements ims government solutions discovered potential noncompliance with various contract clauses and requirements under its general services administration contract the “gsa contract” which was awarded in 2002 to its predecessor company synchronous knowledge inc synchronous knowledge inc was acquired by ims health in may 2005 the potential noncompliance arose from two primary areas first at the direction of the government work performed under one task order was invoiced under another task order without the appropriate modifications to the orders being made and second personnel who did not meet strict compliance with the labor categories component of the qualification requirements of the gsa contract were assigned to contracts upon discovery of the potential noncompliance we began remediation efforts promptly disclosed the potential noncompliance to the united states government and were accepted into the department of defense voluntary disclosure program we filed a voluntary disclosure program report on august 29 2008 we are currently unable to determine the outcome of all of these matters pending the resolution of the voluntary disclosure program process and the ultimate liability arising from these matters could exceed our current reserves

business combinations 

we have completed and will continue to consider strategic business combinations to enhance our capabilities and offerings in certain areas including several individually immaterial acquisitions during the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 in october 2016 we completed the merger to better serve our clients across their entire product lifecycle by i increasing the efficiency of healthcare companies’ commercial organizations through enhanced analytics and outsourcing services ii improving clinical trial design recruitment and execution and iii creating realworld information solutions based on the use of medicines by actual patients in normal situations in july 2015 we combined our global clinical trials laboratory operations in our research  development solutions segment with the clinical trials laboratory operations of quest with the resulting combined business referred to as q 2 solutions we own 60 of q 2 solutions and quest owns the remaining 40

sources of revenue 

total revenues are comprised of revenues from the provision of our services and revenues from reimbursed expenses that are incurred while providing our services we do not have any material product revenues our segment revenues expressed as a percent of 2017 revenues excluding reimbursed expense revenue are as follows 



reimbursed expenses are comprised primarily of payments to physicians investigators who oversee clinical trials and travel expenses for our clinical monitors principally within our research  development solutions segment and travel expenses for our sales representatives within our integrated engagement services segment reimbursed expenses may fluctuate from periodtoperiod due in part to where we are in the lifecycle of the many contracts that are in progress at a particular point in time as reimbursed expenses are passthrough costs to our clients with little to no profit and we believe that the fluctuations from periodtoperiod are not meaningful to our underlying performance we do not provide any analysis of the fluctuations in these items or their impact on our financial results we have collection risk on contractually reimbursable expenses and from time to time are unable to obtain reimbursement from the client for costs incurred when such an expense is not reimbursed it is classified as costs of revenue on the consolidated statements of income 

see note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for details regarding the new revenue recognition standard which will be effective january 1 2018 

costs and expenses 

our costs and expenses are comprised primarily of our costs of revenue reimbursed expenses and selling general and administrative expenses costs of revenue include compensation and benefits for billable employees and personnel involved in production trial monitoring data management and delivery and the costs of acquiring and processing data for our information offerings costs of staff directly involved with delivering technologyrelated services offerings and engagements related accommodations and the costs of data purchased specifically for technology services engagements and other expenses directly related to service contracts such as courier fees laboratory supplies professional services and travel expenses as noted above reimbursed expenses are comprised principally of payments to investigators who oversee clinical trials and travel expenses for our clinical monitors and sales representatives selling general and administrative expenses include costs related to sales marketing and administrative functions including human resources legal finance quality assurance compliance and general management for compensation and benefits travel professional services training and expenses for information technology “it” facilities and depreciation and amortization 

foreign currency translation

in 2017 approximately 41 of our revenues were denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar which represents approximately 55 currencies because a large portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar and our financial statements are reported in united states dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly affect our results of operations the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies and translated into united states dollars for financial reporting purposes accordingly exchange rate fluctuations will affect the translation of foreign results into united states dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated results as a result we believe that providing the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on certain financial results can facilitate the analysis of periodtoperiod comparisons of business performance that excludes the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations the constant currency information assumes the same foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect for the comparable prioryear period were used in translation of the current period results

income tax benefit expense



on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax act the tax act is comprehensive legislation that includes provisions that lower the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 beginning in 2018 and impose a onetime transition tax on undistributed foreign earnings asc 740 “income taxes” generally requires the effects of the tax law change to be recorded in the period of enactment however the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 to address situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computations in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the tax act we have recognized the tax impacts related to the transition tax on undistributed foreign earnings and the impact to deferred tax assets and liabilities and included these amounts in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 on a provisional basis the ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts possibly materially due to among other things additional analysis changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made and additional interpretive regulatory guidance that may be issued the accounting is expected to be complete when the 2017 us corporate income tax return is filed in 2018 

 

as a result of the tax act we recorded a provisional deferred tax benefit of 977 million related to the revaluation of deferred taxes at the newly enacted 21 rate and the reversal of the deferred tax liability on undistributed foreign earnings net of the newly enacted transition tax we no longer consider any of our foreign earnings to be in definitely reinvested our effective income tax rate was also favorably impacted by a tax benefit of 261 million related to purchase accounting amortization of approximately 763 million as a result of the merger additionally due to the adoption of the new stock based compensation accounting standard on january 1 2017 our effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by 26 million of excess tax benefits on equity compensation 

 

the increase in the 2016 effective income tax rate as compared to 2015 was due to a change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion on the majority of our cumulative foreign earnings due to the merger we reevaluated our indefinite reinvestment assertion based on the need for cash in the united states including funding the repurchase program and potential acquisitions accordingly we changed our assertion with respect to 2801 million of foreign earnings including 1865 million of ims health’s previously undistributed historical foreign earnings deferred income taxes of 625 million were recorded in 2016 related to nonindefinitely reinvested foreign earnings of that amount 373 million was recorded through purchase accounting related to ims health’s historical foreign earnings and the remainder of 252 million was recorded through deferred income tax expense

certain costs are not allocated to our segments and are reported as general corporate and unallocated expenses these costs primarily consist of stockbased compensation and expenses for corporate overhead functions such as senior leadership finance human resources information technology facilities and legal in addition we do not allocate depreciation and amortization restructuring costs merger related costs or impairment charges to our segments

research  development solutions 



backlog and net new business 

beginning with the third quarter of 2016 we began reporting net new business and backlog on an ascontracted basis signed binding commitments and signed contracts during the period on a rolling basis for the last twelve months we only report backlog and net new business for the research  development solutions segment previously net new business included nonbinding written awards which was consistent with industry practice we believe the ascontracted method is a more precise approach as it requires a higher threshold and less judgment for backlog inclusion net new business totaled 454 billion and 434 billion for the twelve months ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively ending backlog was 1054 billion at december 31 2017 

net new business under sole provider arrangements is recorded over the life of the arrangement as projects are awarded consistent with our methodology for calculating net new business during a particular period backlog represents at a particular point in time future service revenues from work not yet completed or performed under signed contracts once work begins on a project service revenues are recognized over the duration of the project net new business and backlog denominated in foreign currencies are valued each month using the actual average foreign exchange rates in effect during the month 

  we believe that backlog and net new business may not be consistent indicators of future revenues because they have been and likely will be affected by a number of factors including the variable size and duration of projects many of which are performed over several years cancellations and changes to the scope of work during the course of projects projects that have been delayed remain in backlog but the timing of the revenue generated may differ from the timing originally expected additionally projects may be terminated or delayed by the customer or delayed by regulatory authorities in the event that a client cancels a contract we typically would be entitled to receive payment for all services performed up to the cancellation date and subsequent clientauthorized services related to winding down the canceled project for more details regarding risks related to our backlog see part i item ia “risk factors—risks related to our business—the relationship of backlog to revenues varies over time”

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows in addition to operating cash flows other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include capital expenditures acquisitions investments debt service requirements dividends equity repurchases adequacy of our revolving credit and receivables financing facilities and access to the capital markets 

we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which those funds can be accessed on a costeffective basis the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences however those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations we have and expect to transfer cash from those subsidiaries to the united states and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so 

we had a cash balance of 959 million at december 31 2017 147 million of which was in the united states a decrease from 1198 million at december 31 2016 

based on our current operating plan we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents future cash flows from operations and our ability to access funds under our revolving credit and receivables financing facilities will enable us to fund our operating requirements and capital expenditures and meet debt obligations for at least the next 12 months we regularly evaluate our debt arrangements as well as market conditions and from time to time we may explore opportunities to modify our existing debt arrangements or pursue additional financing arrangements that could result in the issuance of new debt securities by us or our affiliates we may use our existing cash cash generated from operations or dispositions of assets or businesses andor proceeds from any new financing arrangements or issuances of debt or equity securities to repay or reduce some of our outstanding obligations to repurchase shares from our stockholders or for other purposes as part of our ongoing business strategy we also continually evaluate new acquisition expansion and investment possibilities or other strategic growth opportunities as well as potential dispositions of assets or businesses as appropriate including dispositions that may cause us to recognize a loss on certain assets should we elect to pursue any such transaction we may seek to obtain debt or equity financing to facilitate those activities our ability to enter into any such potential transactions and our use of cash or proceeds is limited to varying degrees by the terms and restrictions contained in our existing debt arrangements we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to complete any such financing arrangements or other transactions on favorable terms or at all

contingencies 

we are exposed to certain known contingencies that are material to our investors the facts and circumstances surrounding these contingencies and a discussion of their effect on us are in note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k these contingencies may have a material effect on our liquidity capital resources or results of operations in addition even where our reserves are adequate the incurrence of any of these liabilities may have a material effect on our liquidity and the amount of cash available to us for other purposes 

we believe that we have made appropriate arrangements in respect of the future effect on us of these known contingencies we also believe that the amount of cash available to us from our operations together with cash from financing will be sufficient for us to pay any known contingencies as they become due without materially affecting our ability to conduct our operations and invest in the growth of our business 

contractual obligations and commitments 

below is a summary of our future payment commitments by year under contractual obligations as of december 31 2017 in millions 













 

application of critical accounting policies 

note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates and related disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes known actual results may differ from those estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied 1 there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement 2 the service offering has been delivered to the client 3 the collection of fees is probable and 4 the arrangement consideration is fixed or determinable we do not recognize revenue with respect to startup activities including contract and scope negotiation feasibility analysis and conflict of interest review associated with contracts the costs for these activities are expensed as incurred for contracts in which portions of revenue are contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future events we recognize the revenue only after it has been earned and the contingency has been resolved 

in some cases contracts provide for consideration that is contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future events we recognize contingent revenue when the contingency has been resolved and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met cash payments made to clients as incentives to induce the clients to enter into service agreements with us are amortized as a reduction of revenue over the period the services are performed we record revenues net of any tax assessments by governmental authorities such as value added taxes that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue generating transactions we do not recognize revenue with respect to startup activities including contract and scope negotiation feasibility analysis and conflict of interest review associated with contracts the costs for these activities are expensed as incurred

for arrangements that include multiple elements arrangement consideration is allocated to units of accounting based on the relative selling price the best evidence of selling price of a unit of accounting is vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” which is the price we charge when the deliverable is sold separately when vsoe is not available to determine selling price we use relevant thirdparty evidence “tpe” of selling price if available when neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists we use our best estimate of selling price considering all relevant information that is available without undue cost and effort 

we derive the majority of our revenues in the commercial solutions segment from various information and technology service offerings our revenue arrangements may include multiple elements a typical information offerings arrangement primarily under fixedprice contracts may include an ongoing subscriptionbased deliverable for which revenue is recognized ratably as earned over the contract period andor a onetime delivery of data offerings for which revenue is recognized upon delivery assuming all other criteria are met our subscription arrangements typically have terms ranging from one to three years and are generally noncancelable and do not contain refundtype provisions we also offer technology services offerings that enable our clients to make informed business decisions technology services offerings consist of a mix of small and largescale services and consulting projects multiyear outsourcing contracts and saas licenses these arrangements typically have terms ranging from several weeks to three years with a majority having terms of one year or less revenues for services engagements where deliverables occur ratably over time are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the arrangement revenues from time and material contracts are recognized as the services are provided revenues from fixed price ad hoc services and consulting contracts are recognized either over the contract term based on the ratio of the number of hours incurred for services provided during the period compared to the total estimated hours to be incurred over the entire arrangement efforts based or upon delivery completed contract 

 

the majority of revenue in our research  development solutions segment and integrated engagement services segment is recognized based on objective contractual criteria and does not require significant estimates or judgments however at any point in time we are working on thousands of active client projects which are governed by individual contracts most projects are customized based on the needs of the client the type of services being provided therapeutic indication of the drug geographic locations and other variables project specific terms related to pricing billing terms and the scope and type of services to be provided are generally negotiated and contracted on a projectbyproject basis changes in the scope of work are common especially under longterm contracts and generally result in a change in contract value in such situations we enter into negotiations for a contract amendment to reflect the change in scope and the related price depending on the complexity of the amendment the negotiation process can take from a few weeks for a simple adjustment to several months for a complex amendment management may authorize the project team to commence work on activities outside the contract scope while we negotiate and finalize the contract amendment in these limited cases if we are not able to obtain a contract amendment from the client our profit margin on the arrangement may be impacted this result occurs because our costs of delivery are expensed as they are incurred while revenue is not recognized unless the client has agreed to the changes in scope and renegotiated pricing terms the contract value is amended and all other revenue recognition criteria are met most contracts are terminable upon 30 to 90 days notice by the client our risk of material loss in these situations is mitigated as these contracts generally require payment to us for expenses to wind down the clinical trial or project fees earned to date and in some cases a termination fee or a payment of some portion of the fees or profits that could have been earned under the contract if it had not been terminated early in addition our contract terms provide for payment terms that generally correspond with performance of the services termination fees are included in revenues when realization is assured 

see note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for details regarding the new revenue recognition standard which will be effective january 1 2018

accounts receivable represents amounts billed to clients revenues recognized in excess of billings are classified as unbilled services the realization of these amounts is based on the client’s willingness and ability to pay us we have an allowance for doubtful accounts based on management’s estimate of probable losses we expect to incur resulting from a client failing to pay us our allowance for doubtful accounts and losses from clients failing to pay us have not been material to our results of operations if any of these estimates change or actual results differs from expected results then an adjustment is recorded in the period in which the amounts become reasonably estimable these adjustments could have a material effect on our results of operations 

investments in unconsolidated affiliates—equity method investments 

we have investments in unconsolidated affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting periodically we review our investments for a decline in value which we believe may be other than temporary should we identify such a decline we will record a loss through earnings to establish a new cost basis for the investment these losses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

income taxes 

certain items of income and expense are not recognized on our income tax returns and financial statements in the same year which creates timing differences the income tax effect of these timing differences results in 1 deferred income tax assets that create a reduction in future income taxes and 2 deferred income tax liabilities that create an increase in future income taxes recognition of deferred income tax assets is based on management’s belief that it is more likely than not that the income tax benefit associated with certain temporary differences income tax operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and income tax credits would be realized we recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets for those deferred income tax items for which it was more likely than not that realization would not occur we determined the amount of the valuation allowance based in part on our assessment of future taxable income and in light of our ongoing income tax strategies if our estimate of future taxable income or tax strategies changes at any time in the future we would record an adjustment to our valuation allowance recording such an adjustment could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

 

income tax expense is based on the distribution of profit before income tax among the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate adjusted as required by the income tax laws of each taxing jurisdiction changes in the distribution of profits and losses among taxing jurisdictions may have a significant impact on our effective income tax rate we do not consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states accordingly we have provided a deferred income tax liability related to those undistributed earnings the associated foreign income taxes on our foreign earnings could be available as a credit in the united states on our income taxes we recognize foreign tax credits to the extent that the recognition is supported by projected foreign source income see note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the annual report on form 10k for details regarding the tax cuts and jobs act and the impact on our consolidated financial statements 

business combinations 

we use the acquisition method to account for business combinations and accordingly the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recorded at their estimated fair values on the date of the acquisition we use significant judgments estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest including expected future cash flows discount rates that reflect the risk associated with the expected future cash flows and estimated useful lives 

when a business combination involves contingent consideration we recognize a liability equal to the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the date of the acquisition the estimate of fair value of a contingent consideration liability requires subjective assumptions to be made regarding future business results including revenues and net new business discount rates that reflect the risk associated with the expected future cash flows and probabilities assigned to various potential business result scenarios we reassess the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration each financial reporting period over the term of the arrangement any resulting changes are recognized in earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations 

goodwill tangible and identifiable intangible assets 

we have recorded and allocated to our reporting units the excess of the cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired known as goodwill the recoverability of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated annually for impairment or if and when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment we review the carrying values of other identifiable intangible assets if the facts and circumstances indicate a possible impairment goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized and other identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives we believe that the risk of an impairment to goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets is currently very low 

for goodwill we perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its book value this includes a qualitative analysis of macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations internal cost factors financial performance fair value history and other company specific events if this qualitative analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that estimated fair value is less than the book value for the respective reporting unit we apply a twostep impairment test in which we determine whether the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of its carrying value if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied estimated fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill we determine the implied estimated fair value of goodwill by determining the present value of the estimated future cash flows for each reporting unit and comparing the reporting unit’s risk profile and growth prospects to selected reasonably similar publicly traded companies the inherent subjectivity of applying a discounted cash flow and market comparables approach to valuing our assets and liabilities could have a significant impact on our analysis any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

for indefinitelived intangible assets we perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value if this qualitative analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset we determine the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset trade name by determining the present value of the estimated royalty payments on an aftertax basis that it would be required to pay the owner for the right to use such trade name if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

 

we review the carrying values of property and equipment if the facts and circumstances suggest that a potential impairment may have occurred if this review indicates that carrying values will not be recoverable as determined based on undiscounted cash flows over the remaining depreciation or amortization period we will reduce carrying values to estimated fair value the inherent subjectivity of our estimates of future cash flows could have a significant impact on our analysis any future writeoffs of longlived assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

stockbased compensation 

we measure compensation cost for stockbased payment awards stock options and stock appreciation rights granted to employees and nonemployee directors at fair value using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model and for performance awards using the monte carlo simulation model  stockbased compensation expense includes stockbased awards granted to employees and nonemployee directors and has been reported in selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income based upon the classification of the individuals who were granted stockbased awards 

the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions including share price volatility the expected life of the award riskfree interest rate and the fair value of the underlying common shares on the date of grant in developing our assumptions we take into account the following 











pensions and other postretirement benefits

we provide retirement benefits to certain employees including defined benefit pension plans and postretirement medical plans the determination of benefit obligations and expense is based on actuarial models in order to measure benefit costs and obligations using these models critical assumptions are made with regard to the discount rate expected return on plan assets cash balance crediting rate lump sum conversion rate and the assumed rate of compensation increases in addition retiree medical care cost trend rates are a key assumption used exclusively in determining costs for our postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans management reviews these critical assumptions at least annually other assumptions involve demographic factors such as turnover retirement and mortality rates management reviews these assumptions periodically and updates them when its experience deems it appropriate to do so 

the discount rate is the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled and is determined annually by management for united states plans the discount rate is based on results of a modeling process in which the plans’ expected cash flow determined on a projected benefit obligation basis is matched with spot rates developed from a yield curve comprised of highgrade moody’s aa and above or standard and poor’s aa and above noncallable corporate bonds to develop the present value of the expected cash flow and then determining the single rate discount rate which when applied to the expected cash flow derives that same present value in the united kingdom specifically the discount rate is set based on the yields on a universe of high quality noncallable corporate bonds denominated in the british pound appropriate to the duration of plan liabilities for the other nonunited states plans the discount rate is based on the current yield of an index of high quality corporate bonds as a sensitivity measure a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate for our united states plan and united kingdom plans absent any offsetting changes in other assumptions would result in a 1 million decrease and a less than 1 million increase respectively in pension expense at december 31 2017 

under the united states qualified retirement plan participants have a notional retirement account that increases with pay and investment credits the rate used to determine the investment credit cash balance crediting rate varies monthly at retirement the account is converted to a monthly retirement benefit 

 

in selecting an expected return on plan asset assumption we consider the returns being earned by each plan investment category in the fund the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment and longterm economic forecasts for the type of investments held by the plan the actual return on plan assets will vary from year to year versus this assumption we believe it is appropriate to use longterm expected forecasts in selecting the expected return on plan assets as such there can be no assurance that our actual return on plan assets will approximate the longterm expected forecasts as a sensitivity measure a 25 basis point change in the expected return on assets “eroa” assumption for our united states plan absent any offsetting changes in other assumptions would result in a less than 1 million increase or decrease in pension expense at december 31 2017  for our united kingdom plans a 25 basis point change in the eroa assumption absent any offsetting changes in other assumptions would result in a less than 1 million increase or decrease in pension expense at december 31 2017  while we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our pension and postretirement obligations and future expense 

we utilize a corridor approach to amortizing unrecognized gains and losses in the pension and postretirement plans amortization occurs when the accumulated unrecognized net gain or loss balance exceeds the criterion of 10 of the larger of the beginning balances of the projected benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of the plan assets the excess unrecognized gain or loss balance is then amortized using the straightline method over the average remaining service life of active employees expected to receive benefits at december 31 2017 the weightedaverage remaining service life of active employees was approximately 12 years 

foreign currency 

we have significant investments in nonunited states countries therefore changes in the value of foreign currencies affect our consolidated financial statements when translated into united states dollars for all operations outside the united states where we have designated the local currency as the functional currency assets and liabilities are translated using endofperiod exchange rates revenues expenses and cash flows are translated using average rates of exchange prevailing during the period the transactions occurred translation gains and losses are included as an adjustment to the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders’ equity in addition gains and losses from foreign currency transactions such as those resulting from the settlement and revaluation of thirdparty and intercompany foreign receivables and payables are included in the determination of net income loss 

for operations outside the united states that are considered to be highly inflationary or where the united states dollar is designated as the functional currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured using endofperiod exchange rates whereas nonmonetary accounts are remeasured using historical exchange rates and all remeasurement and transaction adjustments are recognized in other expense income net

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to various market risks and we regularly evaluate our exposure to such changes our overall risk management strategy seeks to balance the magnitude of the exposure and the cost and availability of appropriate financial instruments the following analyses present the sensitivity of our financial instruments to hypothetical changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period 

foreign currency exchange rates 

we transact business in more than 100 countries and approximately 55 currencies and are subject to risks associated with fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates our objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency exchange rate movements accordingly we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the impact of foreign exchange movements on non–functional currency assets and liabilities we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency cash flows related to service contracts and to hedge nonunited states dollar anticipated intercompany royalties it is our policy to enter into foreign currency transactions only to the extent necessary to meet our objectives as stated above we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for investment or speculative purposes the principal currencies hedged are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the swiss franc and the canadian dollar 

the contractual value of our foreign exchange derivative instruments all of which were foreign exchange forward contracts was approximately 282 million at december 31 2017 the fair value of these contracts is subject to change as a result of potential changes in foreign exchange rates we assess our market risk based on changes in foreign exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in fair values based on a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates the potential loss in fair value for foreign exchange forward contracts based on a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the united states dollar or in the case of nonunited states dollar related contracts the currency being purchased was 12 million at december 31 2017 however the change in the fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts would likely be offset by a change in the value of the future service contract revenue royalty or balance sheet exposure being hedged caused by the currency exchange rate fluctuation the estimated fair values of the foreign exchange forward contracts were determined based on quoted market prices 

exchange rate fluctuations affect the united states dollar value of foreign currency revenue and expenses and may have a significant effect on our results excluding the impacts from any outstanding or future hedging transactions a hypothetical 10 change in average exchange rates used to translate all foreign currencies to the united states dollar would have impacted income before income taxes for 2017 by approximately 112 million the actual impact of exchange rate movements in the future could differ materially from this hypothetical analysis based on the mix of foreign currencies and the timing and magnitude of individual exchange rate movements 

additionally commencing in 2016 we designated a portion of our foreign currency denominated debt as a hedge of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries to reduce the volatility in stockholders’ equity caused by changes in the euro exchange rate with respect to the united states dollar as of december 31 2017 these borrowings net of original issue discount were €4036 million 4835 million a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the united states dollar would lead to a potential loss in fair value of 484 million however this change in fair value would be offset by the change in value of the hedged portion of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries caused by the currency exchange rate fluctuation   

interest rates 

because we have variable rate debt fluctuations in interest rates affect our business we attempt to minimize interest rate risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate caps and swaps we have entered into interest rate caps and swaps with financial institutions that have reset dates and critical terms that match the underlying debt accordingly any change in market value associated with the interest rate caps and swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt as of december 31 2017 we had approximately 55 billion of variable rate indebtedness and interest rate caps and swaps with a notional value of 16 billion because we do not attempt to hedge all of our variable rate debt we may incur higher interest costs for the portion of our variable rate debt that is not hedged excluding debt covered by hedges each quarterpoint increase or decrease in the interest rate on our variable rate debt would result in our interest expense changing by approximately 10 million per year 

 

marketable securities 

at december 31 2017 we held investments in marketable equity securities these investments are classified as either trading securities or availableforsale securities and are recorded at fair value these securities are subject to price risk as of december 31 2017 the fair value of these investments was 46 million based on the quoted market value of the securities the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease of 10 in quoted market values was approximately 5 million at december 31 2017

 item 1 business 

our company 

we are a leading worldwide integrated information and technologyenabled healthcare service provider dedicated to helping our clients improve their clinical scientific and commercial results formed through the merger of quintiles and ims health quintilesims’s over 50000 employees conduct operations in more than 100 countries our broad range of healthcare information technology and service solutions span the entire product lifecycle from clinical to commercial operations bringing clients an opportunity to realize the full potential of innovations and advanced healthcare outcomes 

following the merger we have one of the largest and most comprehensive collections of healthcare information in the world which includes more than 530 million comprehensive longitudinal anonymous patient records spanning sales prescription and promotional data medical claims electronic medical records and social media our scaled and growing data set contains over 20 petabytes of proprietary data sourced from more than 100000 data suppliers and covering over 800000 data feeds globally based on this data we deliver information and insights on over 85 of the world’s pharmaceuticals as measured by 2015 sales we standardize organize structure and integrate this data by applying our sophisticated analytics and leveraging our global technology infrastructure this helps our clients run their organizations more efficiently and make better decisions to improve their clinical commercial and financial performance the breadth of the intelligent actionable information we provide is not comprehensively available from any other source and our scope of information would be difficult and costly for another party to replicate 

we leverage our proprietary information assets to develop clinical and commercial capabilities with a talented healthcarefocused workforce that enables us to grow our relationships with healthcare stakeholders throughout the life science’s value chain this set of capabilities includes 

 

  

  

  

  

  

our missioncritical relationships with our life science clients consist of four important decisionmaking processes related to their product portfolios research and development prelaunch launch and inmarket we continue to develop software and services applications to further deepen our level of client integration by enabling our clients to enhance andor automate many components of these key decisionmaking processes 

 

 

  

we believe that a powerful component of our value proposition is the breadth and depth of intelligence we provide to help our clients address fundamental operational questions 

 

 our market opportunity 

we compete in a market of greater than 230 billion consisting of outsourced research and development realworld evidence and connected health and technology enabled commercial operations markets for the life sciences companies and the broader healthcare industry the following sets forth our estimates for the size of our principal markets 

 

  

  

 in deriving estimates of the size of the various markets described above we review thirdparty sources which include estimates and forecasts of spending in various market segments in combination with internal quintilesims research and analysis informed by our experience serving these market segments as well as projected growth rates for each of these segments 

 

we believe there are six key trends affecting our end markets that will create increasing demand for research and development services and commercial solutions 

growth and innovation in the life sciences industry the life sciences industry is a large and critical part of the global healthcare system and according to the latest information available from the quintilesims market prognosis service is estimated to have generated approximately 11 trillion in revenue in 2016 according to our research revenue growth in the life sciences industry globally is expected to range from 4 to 7 between 2017 and 2021 according to the quintilesims institute it is estimated that spending on pharmaceuticals in emerging markets will expand at a 69 compound annual growth rate “cagr” through 2021 the growth of emerging markets is making these geographies strategically important to life sciences organizations and consistent with their approach in the developed markets we expect these organizations to apply a high degree of sophistication to their commercial operations in these countries for global companies this requires highly localized knowledge and information assets the development of market access strategies and performance benchmarking in addition local players are learning that they need to compete on the basis of improved information and analytics 

growth in research and development  spending trends in research and development are impacted as a result of several factors including major biopharmaceutical companies’ efforts to replenish revenues lost from the socalled “patent cliff” of recent years increased access to capital by the small and midcap biotechnology industry and recent increases in pharmaceutical approvals by regulatory authorities the quintilesims institute also estimates that 225 new molecular entities “nmes” are expected to be approved between 2017 and 2021 compared to 184 between 2011 and 2015 and 146 between 2006 and 2010 we believe that further research and development spending combined with the continued need for cost efficiency across the healthcare landscape will continue to create opportunities for biopharmaceutical services companies particularly those with a global reach and broad service offerings to help biopharmaceutical companies with their pre and postlaunch solutions development and commercialization needs 

increased complexity in research and development biopharmaceutical companies face environments in which it has become increasingly difficult to operate improved standards of care in many therapeutic areas and the emergence of new types of therapies such as biologics genetically targeted therapies gene and stem cell therapies and other treatment modalities have led to more complex development and regulatory pathways for example the united states and european countries have recently released guidelines for the development of “biosimilar” products we believe that our global clinical development capabilities including our expertise in biomarkers and genomics and our global laboratory network position us well to help biopharmaceutical companies manage the complexities inherent in an environment where this type of expertise is important 

regulators require clinical trials involving local populations as part of the process for approving new pharmaceutical products especially in certain asian and emerging markets understanding the epidemiological and physiological differences in different ethnic populations and being able to conduct clinical trials locally in certain geographies will be important to pharmaceutical product growth strategies both for multinational and localregional biopharmaceutical companies we believe that our global clinical development capabilities and unmatched presence in asia and other emerging markets make us a strong partner for biopharmaceutical companies managing the complexities of international drug development 

financial pressures driving the need for increased efficiency despite expected accelerating growth in the global life sciences market we believe our clients will face increased operating margin pressure due to their changing product mix pricing and reimbursement challenges and rising costs of compliance product portfolios for life sciences companies have shifted toward specialty products with lower peak market sales potential than traditional primary care medicines we believe that the need for biopharmaceutical companies to maximize productivity and lower costs across their processes from research and development through commercial 

 

operations will cause them to look to partners as they enter into outsourcing arrangements to improve efficiency further our clients are looking for new ways to simplify processes and drive operational efficiencies by using automation consolidating vendors and adopting new technology options such as hosted and cloudbased applications this provides opportunities for technology services vendors to capture and consolidate internal spending by providing lowercost and variablecost options that lower clients’ research and development selling marketing and administrative costs 

evolving need to integrate and structure expanding sources of data over the past decade many health systems around the world have focused on digitizing medical records while such records theoretically enhance access to data relevant information is often unintegrated unstructured siloed in disparate software systems or entered inconsistently in addition new sources of data from the internet such as social media and information on limited patient pools and information resulting from enhanced diagnostic technologies are creating new sources of healthcare data 

in order to derive valuable insights from existing and expanding sources of information clients need access to statistically significant data sets organized into databases that can be queried and analyzed for example realworld evidence studies demonstrate practical and clinical efficacies which we believe require the aggregation and integration of large clinical data sets across all care settings types of therapies and patient cohorts longitudinal studies require analysis of anonymous patient diagnoses treatments procedures and laboratory test results to identify types of patients that will likely best respond to particular therapies finally manufacturers also require the ability to analyze social media activity to identify the specific patient and advocacy groups that influence the adoption of new orphan drugs this information is highly relevant to all healthcare stakeholders and we believe the opportunity to more broadly apply healthcare data can only be realized through structuring organizing and integrating new and existing forms of data in conjunction with sophisticated analytics 

need for demonstrated value in healthcare participants in the healthcare industry are focused on improving quality and reducing costs both of which require assessment of quality and value of therapies and providers as a result physicians no longer make prescribing decisions in isolation but rather in the context of guidance and rules from payers integrated delivery networks and governments we believe life sciences companies are working to bring alignment across constituents on the value of their treatments in order to successfully develop and commercialize new therapies 

there is increasing pressure on life sciences companies to support and justify the value of their therapies many new drugs that are being approved are more expensive than existing therapies and will likely receive heightened scrutiny by regulators and payers to determine whether the existing treatment options would be sufficient additionally many new specialty drugs are molecularbased therapies and require a more detailed understanding of clinical factors and influencers that demonstrate therapeutic value as a result leading life sciences companies are utilizing more sophisticated outcome research and data analytics services 

we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of these global trends in healthcare beyond our proprietary information assets we have developed key capabilities to assess opportunities to develop and commercialize therapies support and defend the value of medicines and help our clients operate more efficiently through the application of insightdriven decisionmaking and costefficient technology solutions 

our growth strategy 

we believe we are well positioned for continued growth across the markets we serve our strategy for achieving growth includes 

continue to innovate by leveraging our information technology and service capabilities as a leader in the development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical therapies we can empower our therapeutic 

 

scientific and domain experts with expansive levels of information including product level tracking in 90 markets and information about treatments and outcomes on more than 530 million anonymous patients further we have the ability to optimize the clinical trial process and enable our clients to reduce costs and get their products to market more quickly by running their clinical trials more efficiently and effectively through more informed site selection and faster patient recruitment practices 

build upon our extensive client relationships  we have a diversified base of over 5000 clients in over 100 countries and through the merger have expanded our client value proposition to address a broader market for research and development and commercial operations which we estimate to be 230 billion in 2016 through the combined offerings of research and development and commercial services we built a platform that allows us to be a more complete partner to our clients 

expand portfolio through strategic acquisitions we have and expect to continue to acquire assets and businesses that strengthen our value proposition to clients we have developed an internal capability to source evaluate and integrate acquisitions that have created value for stockholders as the global healthcare landscape evolves we expect that there will be a growing number of acquisition opportunities across the life sciences payer and provider sectors we expect to continue to invest in or explore opportunities for strategic acquisitions to grow our platform and enhance our ability to provide more services to our clients 

expand the penetration of our offerings to the broader healthcare marketplace we believe that substantial opportunities exist to expand penetration of our addressable market and further integrate our offerings in a broader crosssection of the healthcare marketplace particularly connected healthcare 

our offerings

government regulation 

many aspects of our businesses are regulated by federal and state laws rules and regulations accordingly we maintain a comprehensive compliance program and we believe we operate our business in substantial compliance with all existing legal requirements material to the operation of our businesses there are however significant uncertainties involving the application of various legal requirements the violation of which could result in among other things sanctions see “part i—item 1a—risk factors” for additional detail 

good clinical practice 

good clinical practice “gcp” regulations and guidelines contain the industry standards for the conduct of clinical trials with respect to the integrity of the data and safety of the research subjects the united states food and drug administration “fda” the european medicines agency “ema” japan’s ministry of health labour and welfare and many other regulatory authorities require that study results and data submitted to such authorities be based on clinical trials conducted in accordance with gcp provisions records for clinical trials must be maintained for specified periods for inspection by the fda and other regulators 

regulation of drugs biologics and medical devices 

in the united states pharmaceutical biological and medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by the fda the federal food drug and cosmetic act “fdc act” the public health service act “phs act” and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern among other things the research development testing manufacture storage recordkeeping approval labeling promotion and marketing distribution postapproval monitoring and reporting sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical 

 

biological and medical device products failure to comply with applicable united states requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions such as fda refusal to approve a pending new drug application “nda” for a new drug a biologics license application “bla” for a new biological product premarket approval “pma” or clearance for a new medical device warning or untitled letters product recalls product seizures total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions fines civil penalties and criminal prosecution 

regulation of patient information 

our information management services relate to the diagnosis and treatment of disease and are therefore subject to substantial governmental regulation in addition the confidentiality of patientspecific information and the circumstances under which such patientspecific records may be released for inclusion in our databases or used in other aspects of our business is heavily regulated federal state and foreign governments are contemplating or have proposed or adopted additional legislation governing the possession use and dissemination of personal data such as personal health information and personal financial data as well as security breach notification rules for loss or theft of such data additional legislation or regulation of this type might among other things require us to implement new security measures and processes or bring within the legislation or regulation deidentified health or other personal data each of which may require substantial expenditures or limit our ability to offer some of our services 

in particular personal healthrelated information is recognized in many countries such as the united states the european union or eu and several countries in asia as a special sensitive category of personal information subject to additional mandatory protections violations of data protection regulations are subject to administrative penalties civil money penalties and criminal prosecution including corporate fines and personal liability 

regulation of promotion marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products and medical devices 

our services are subject to detailed and comprehensive regulation in each geographic market in which we operate such regulation relates among other things to the distribution of drug samples the marketing and promotion of approved products the qualifications of sales representatives and the use of healthcare professionals in sales functions 

in the united states our services are subject to numerous federal and state laws pertaining to promotional activities involving pharmaceutical products and medical devices such as the fda’s regulations against “offlabel promotion” which require sales representatives to restrict promotion of the approved product they are detailing to the approved labeling for the product and the prescription drug marketing act which imposes licensing personnel record keeping packaging labeling product handling and facility storage and security requirements other federal and state laws prohibit manufacturers suppliers and providers from offering giving or receiving kickbacks or other remuneration in connection with ordering or recommending the purchase or rental of healthcare items and services the sale or distribution of pharmaceutical products and devices is also governed by the united states federal trade commission act and state consumer protection laws we are subject to similar regulations currently in effect in the other countries where we offer integrated healthcare services 

we are also subject to various laws and regulations that may apply to certain drug and device promotional practices including among others various aspects of the medicare program violations of these laws and regulations may result in criminal andor civil penalties including possibly as an “aider and abettor” 

 

regulation of laboratories 

our united states “central” laboratories are subject to licensing and regulation under federal state and local laws relating to hazard communication and employee righttoknow regulations and the safety and health of laboratory employees additionally our united states laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations and licensing requirements relating to the handling storage and disposal of hazardous waste radioactive materials and laboratory specimens including the regulations of the environmental protection agency the nuclear regulatory commission the department of transportation the national fire protection agency and the united states drug enforcement administration “dea” the use of controlled substances in testing for drugs with a potential for abuse is regulated in the united states by the dea and by similar regulatory bodies in other parts of the world our united states laboratories using controlled substances for testing purposes are licensed by the dea the regulations of the united states department of transportation public health service and postal service apply to the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens our laboratories also are subject to international air transport association regulations which govern international shipments of laboratory specimens furthermore when the materials are sent to a foreign country the transportation of such materials becomes subject to the laws rules and regulations of such foreign country our laboratories outside the united states are subject to applicable national laws governing matters such as licensing the handling and disposal of medical specimens hazardous waste and radioactive materials as well as the health and safety of laboratory employees 

in addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace the united states occupational safety and health administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers may be exposed to bloodborne pathogens such as hiv and the hepatitis b virus although we believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with such federal state and local laws failure to comply with such laws could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business fines criminal penalties and other enforcement actions 

further laboratories that analyze human blood or other biological samples for the diagnosis and treatment of clinical trial subjects must comply with clinical laboratory improvement amendments “clia” as well as requirements established by various states the failure to meet these requirements may result in civil penalties and suspension or revocation of the clia certification 

our intellectual property 

in addition to our proprietary data sets described above we develop and use a number of proprietary methodologies analytics systems technologies and other intellectual property in the conduct of our business we rely upon a combination of legal technical and administrative safeguards to protect our proprietary and confidential information and trade secrets and patent copyright and trademark laws to protect other intellectual property rights we consider our trademark and related names marks and logos to be of material importance to our business and we have registered or applied for registration for certain of these trademarks including quintilesims quintiles ims health and ims in the united states and other jurisdictions and aggressively seek to protect them trademarks and service marks generally may be renewed indefinitely so long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained and so long as they have not been found to have become generic although we believe the ownership of our patents trademarks and service marks is an important factor in our business and that our success does depend in part on the ownership thereof we rely primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of our employees 

our employees 

as of december 31 2016 we have over 50000 employees worldwide almost all of these employees are fulltime none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor 

union employees in certain locations outside of the united states are represented by works councils as required 

 

by local laws we believe that our relations with our employees are good and have been maintained in a normal and customary manner

 item 1a risk factors 

risk factors 

we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks some of which are beyond our control you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below together with the other information included in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating our company the occurrence of any of the following risks may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects 

risks relating to our business 

the potential loss or delay of our large contracts or of multiple contracts could adversely affect our results 

most of our research  development solutions clients can terminate our contracts upon 30 to 90 days notice our clients may delay terminate or reduce the scope of our contracts for a variety of reasons beyond our control including but not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result contract terminations delays and alterations are a regular part of our research  development solutions business in the event of termination our contracts often provide for fees for winding down the project but these fees may not be sufficient for us to maintain our margins and termination may result in lower resource utilization rates in addition we may not realize the full benefits of our backlog of contractually committed services if our clients cancel delay or reduce their commitments under our contracts with them which may occur if among other things a client decides to shift its business to a competitor or revoke our status as a preferred provider thus the loss or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could adversely affect our revenues and profitability we believe the risk of loss or delay of multiple contracts potentially has greater effect where we are party to broader partnering arrangements with global biopharmaceutical companies 

 

we depend on third parties for data and support services our suppliers or providers might restrict our use of or refuse to license data or provide services which could lead to our inability to access certain data or provide certain services and as a result materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

each of our commercial solutions information services is derived from data we collect from third parties these data suppliers are numerous and diverse reflecting the broad scope of information that we collect and use in our business 

although we typically enter into longterm contractual arrangements with many of these suppliers of data at the time of entry into a new contract or renewal of an existing contract suppliers may increase restrictions on our use of such data increase the price they charge us for data or refuse altogether to license the data to us in addition during the term of any data supply contract suppliers may fail to adhere to our data quality control standards or fail to deliver data further although no single individual data supplier is material to our business if a number of suppliers collectively representing a significant amount of data that we use for one or more of our services were to impose additional contractual restrictions on our use of or access to data fail to adhere to our qualitycontrol standards repeatedly fail to deliver data or refuse to provide data now or in the future our ability to provide those services to our clients could be materially adversely impacted which may harm our operating results and financial condition 

additionally we depend on third parties for support services to our business such support services include but are not limited to thirdparty transportation providers suppliers of drugs for patients participating in clinical trials suppliers of kits for use in our clinical trial laboratories business suppliers of reagents for use in our testing equipment and providers of maintenance contracts for our equipment the failure of any of these third parties to adequately provide the critical support services could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if we fail to perform our services in accordance with contractual requirements regulatory standards and ethical considerations we could be subject to significant costs or liability and our reputation could be harmed 

in connection with our research  development solutions business we contract with biopharmaceutical companies to perform a wide range of services to assist them in bringing new drugs to market our services include monitoring clinical trials data and laboratory analysis electronic data capture patient recruitment and other related services such services are complex and subject to contractual requirements regulatory standards and ethical considerations for example we must adhere to regulatory requirements such as the fda and current gcp good laboratory practice and good manufacturing practice requirements if we fail to perform our services in accordance with these requirements regulatory agencies may take action against us for failure to comply with applicable regulations governing clinical trials or sales and marketing practices such actions may include sanctions such as injunctions or failure of such regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of products delay suspension or withdrawal of approvals license revocation product seizures or recalls operational restrictions civil or criminal penalties or prosecutions damages or fines clients may also bring claims against us for breach of our contractual obligations and patients in the clinical trials and patients taking drugs approved on the basis of those clinical trials may bring personal injury claims against us for negligence any such action could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and reputation 

such consequences could arise if among other things the following occur 

improper performance of our services the performance of clinical development services is complex and timeconsuming for example we may make mistakes in conducting a clinical trial that could negatively impact 

 

or obviate the usefulness of the clinical trial or cause the results of the clinical trial to be reported improperly if the clinical trial results are compromised we could be subject to significant costs or liability which could have an adverse impact on our ability to perform our services as examples 

 

  

  

 large clinical trials can cost up to hundreds of millions of dollars and while we endeavor to contractually limit our exposure to such risks improper performance of our services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition damage our reputation and result in the cancellation of current contracts by or failure to obtain future contracts from the affected client or other clients 

investigation of clients from time to time one or more of our clients are audited or investigated by regulatory authorities or enforcement agencies with respect to regulatory compliance of their clinical trials programs or the marketing and sale of their drugs in these situations we have often provided services to our clients with respect to the clinical trials programs or activities being audited or investigated and we are called upon to respond to requests for information by the authorities and agencies there is a risk that either our clients or regulatory authorities could claim that we performed our services improperly or that we are responsible for clinical trial or program compliance if our clients or regulatory authorities make such claims against us and prove them we could be subject to damages fines or penalties in addition negative publicity regarding regulatory compliance of our clients’ clinical trials programs or drugs could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

insufficient client funding to complete a clinical trial as noted above clinical trials can cost hundreds of millions of dollars there is a risk that we may initiate a clinical trial for a client and then the client becomes unwilling or unable to fund the completion of the clinical trial in such a situation notwithstanding the client’s ability or willingness to pay for or otherwise facilitate the completion of the clinical trial we may be ethically bound to complete or wind down the clinical trial at our own expense 

security breaches and unauthorized use of our it systems and information or the it systems or information in the possession of our vendors could expose us our clients our data suppliers or others to risk of loss 

we rely upon the security of our computer and communications systems infrastructure to protect us from cyberattacks and unauthorized access cyberattacks can include malware computer viruses hacking or other significant disruption of our computer communications and related systems although we take steps to manage and avoid these risks and to prevent their recurrence our preventive and remedial actions may not be successful such attacks whether successful or unsuccessful could result in our incurring costs related to for example rebuilding internal systems defending against litigation responding to regulatory inquiries or actions paying damages or fines or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties publicity about vulnerabilities and attempted or successful incursions could damage our reputation with clients and data suppliers and reduce demand for our services 

we also store proprietary and sensitive information in connection with our business which could be compromised by a cyberattack to the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data an inappropriate disclosure of proprietary or sensitive information an inability to access data sources or an inability to process data or provide our offerings to our clients it could cause significant damage to our 

 

reputation affect our relationships with our data suppliers and clients including loss of suppliers and clients lead to claims against us and ultimately harm our business we may be required to incur significant costs to alleviate remedy or protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future we may also face inquiry or increased scrutiny from government agencies as a result of any such disruption or breach while we have insurance coverage for certain instances of a cyber security breach our coverage may not be sufficient if we suffer a significant attack or multiple attacks any such breach or disruption could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and our reputation as a provider of missioncritical services 

some of our vendors have significant responsibility for the security of certain of our data centers and computerbased platforms also our data suppliers have responsibility for security of their own computer and communications environments these third parties face risks relating to cyber security similar to ours which could disrupt their businesses and therefore materially impact ours accordingly we are subject to any flaw in or breaches to their computer and communications systems or those that they operate for us which could result in a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial results 

failure to meet productivity objectives under our internal business transformation initiatives could adversely impact our competitiveness and harm our operating results 

we are pursuing business transformation initiatives to update technology increase innovation and obtain operating efficiencies as part of these initiatives we seek to improve our productivity flexibility quality functionality and cost savings by investing in the development and implementation of global platforms and integration of our business processes and functions to achieve economies of scale for example we hired and trained more than 500 people to form a center of excellence “coe” in manila the philippines for standardizing and cleaning data received from data suppliers developed updated tools for standardizing and cleaning data are moving local standardizing and cleaning from countries around the world to the manila coe and retired local standardizing and cleaning systems these various initiatives may not yield their intended gains which may impact our competitiveness and our ability to meet our growth objectives and as a result materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

if we are unsuccessful at investing in growth opportunities our business could be materially and adversely affected 

we continue to invest significantly in growth opportunities including the development and acquisition of new data technologies and services to meet our clients’ needs for example we are expanding our services and technology offerings such as the development of a cloudbased platform with a growing number of applications to support commercial operations for life sciences companies eg multichannel marketing marketing campaign management customer relationship management incentive compensation management targeting and segmentation performance management and other applications we also continue to invest significantly in growth opportunities in emerging markets such as the development launch and enhancement of services in china india russia turkey and other countries we believe healthcare spending in these emerging markets will continue to grow over the next five years and we consider our presence in these markets to be an important focus of our growth strategy 

there is no assurance that our investment plans or growth strategy will be successful or will produce a sufficient or any return on our investments further if we are unable to develop new technologies and services clients do not purchase our new technologies and services our new technologies and services do not work as intended or there are delays in the availability or adoption of our new technologies and services then we may not be able to grow our business or growth may occur slower than anticipated additionally although we expect continued growth in healthcare spending in emerging markets such spending may occur more slowly or not at all and we may not benefit from our investments in these markets 

 

we plan to fund growth opportunities with cash from operations or from future financings there can be no assurance that those sources will be available in sufficient amounts to fund future growth opportunities when needed 

any of the foregoing could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

data protection privacy and similar laws restrict access use and disclosure of information and failure to comply with or adapt to changes in these laws could materially and adversely harm our business 

patient health information is among the most sensitive of personal information and it is critical that information about an individual’s healthcare is properly protected from inappropriate access use and disclosure laws restricting access use and disclosure of such information include the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” the european union “eu” data protection directive which will be superseded by the general data protection regulation canada’s personal information protection and electronic documents act and other data protection privacy and similar national stateprovincial and local laws we have established frameworks models processes and technologies to manage privacy for many data types from a variety of sources and under myriad privacy and data protection laws worldwide in addition we rely on our data suppliers to deliver information to us in a form and in a manner that complies with applicable privacy and data protection laws these laws are complex and there is no assurance that the safeguards and controls employed by us or our data suppliers will be sufficient to prevent a breach of these laws or that claims will not be filed against us or our data suppliers despite such safeguards and controls for example in february 2014 a group of individuals filed a civil lawsuit in korea against ims health korea ltd our whollyowned subsidiary “ims korea” the korean pharmaceutical association “kpa” and a kpa affiliate that supplies data to ims korea the lawsuit alleges the kpa affiliate collected plaintiffs’ personal information without the necessary consent in violation of applicable privacy laws and transferred such information to ims korea for sale to clients in addition in july 2015 indictments were issued by the seoul central district prosecutors’ office in south korea against ims korea and two of its employees among others alleging improper handling of sensitive health information in violation of applicable privacy laws alleged or actual failure to comply with such laws may result in among other things negative publicity damage to our reputation civil and criminal liability data being blocked from use or liability under contractual provisions 

laws and expectations relating to privacy continue to evolve and we continue to adapt to changing needs nevertheless changes in these laws including newly released interpretations of these laws by courts and regulatory bodies may limit our data access use and disclosure and may require increased expenditures by us or may dictate that we not offer certain types of services any of the foregoing may have a material adverse impact on our ability to provide services to our clients or maintain our profitability 

there is ongoing concern from privacy advocates regulators and others regarding data protection and privacy issues and the number of jurisdictions with data protection and privacy laws has been increasing also there are ongoing public policy discussions regarding whether the standards for deidentified anonymous or pseudonomized health information are sufficient and the risk of reidentification sufficiently small to adequately protect patient privacy these discussions may lead to further restrictions on the use of such information there can be no assurance that these initiatives or future initiatives will not adversely affect our ability to access and use data or to develop or market current or future services 

data protection privacy and similar laws protect more than patient information and although they vary by jurisdiction these laws can extend to employee information business contact information provider information and other information relating to identifiable individuals failure to comply with these laws may result in among other things civil and criminal liability negative publicity damage to our reputation and liability under contractual provisions in addition compliance with such laws may require increased costs to us or may dictate that we not offer certain types of services 

 

the occurrence of any of the foregoing could impact our ability to provide the same level of service to our clients require us to modify our offerings or increase our costs which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

current and proposed laws and regulations regarding the protection of personal data could result in increased risks of liability or increased cost to us or could limit our service offerings 

the confidentiality collection use and disclosure of personal data including clinical trial patientspecific information are subject to governmental regulation generally in the country that the personal data were collected or used for example united states federal regulations under health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” and as amended in 2014 by the health information technology for economic and clinical health “hitech” act require individuals’ written authorization in addition to any required informed consent before protected health information may be used for research we are both directly and indirectly affected by the privacy provisions surrounding individual authorizations because many investigators with whom we are involved in clinical trials are directly subject to them as a hipaa “covered entity” and because we obtain identifiable health information from third parties that are subject to such regulations as there are some instances where we are a hipaa “business associate” of a “covered entity” we can also be directly liable for mishandling protected health information under hipaa’s enforcement scheme we can be subject to up to 15 million in annual civil penalties for each hipaa violation 

in the eu personal data includes any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person with health information carrying additional obligations including obtaining the explicit consent from the individual for collection use or disclosure of the information in addition we are subject to eu rules with respect to crossborder transfers of such data out of the eu the united states the eu and its member states and other countries where we have operations such as japan south korea malaysia the philippines russia and singapore continue to issue new privacy and data protection rules and regulations that relate to personal data and health information failure to comply with certain certificationregistration and annual recertificationregistration provisions associated with these data protection and privacy regulations and rules in various jurisdictions or to resolve any serious privacy complaints could subject us to regulatory sanctions criminal prosecution or civil liability federal state and foreign governments are contemplating or have proposed or adopted additional legislation governing the collection possession use or dissemination of personal data such as personal health information and personal financial data as well as security breach notification rules for loss or theft of such data additional legislation or regulation of this type might among other things require us to implement new security measures and processes or bring within the legislation other personal data each of which may require substantial expenditures or limit our ability to offer some of our services additionally if we violate applicable laws regulations or duties relating to the use privacy or security of personal data we could be subject to civil liability or criminal prosecution be forced to alter our business practices and suffer reputational harm 

our success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 

our success depends in part upon our ability to develop use and protect our proprietary methodologies analytics systems technologies and other intellectual property existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights and the protection in some countries may be very limited we rely upon a combination of trade secrets confidentiality policies nondisclosure invention assignment and other contractual arrangements and patent copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights these laws are subject to change at any time and certain agreements may not be fully enforceable which could further restrict our ability to protect our innovations our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing services similar to or duplicative of ours further the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors former employees or other third parties and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 

 

our ability to obtain protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation or thirdparty opposition risks as well as the uncertainty as to the scope of protection registrability patentability validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights in each applicable country governments may adopt regulations and government agencies or courts may render decisions requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property rights when we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights we may be subject to claims that the intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our confidential and proprietary information litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly time consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property rights furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management’s attention and resources could delay further sales or the implementation of our solutions impair the functionality of our solutions delay introductions of new solutions result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our solutions or injure our reputation and harm our operating results and financial condition 

depending on the circumstances we might need to grant a specific client greater rights in intellectual property developed in connection with a contract than we otherwise generally do in certain situations we might forego all rights to the use of intellectual property we create which would limit our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other clients any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenuegenerating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop or license new or modified solutions for future projects 

the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could reduce the differentiation of our services and harm our business the value of our investment in development or business acquisitions could be reduced and third parties might make claims against us related to losses of their confidential or proprietary information in addition we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights these incidents and claims could harm our business reduce revenue increase expenses and harm our reputation 

we may be subject to claims by others that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights 

third parties may assert claims that we or our clients infringe their intellectual property rights and these claims with or without merit could be expensive to litigate cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management resources and attention in defending the claim in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can also seek injunctive relief that may limit the operation of our business or prevent the marketing and selling of our services that infringe on the plaintiff’s intellectual property rights to resolve these claims we may enter into licensing agreements with restrictive terms or significant fees stop selling be required to implement costly redesigns to the affected services or pay damages to satisfy contractual obligations to others if we do not resolve these claims in advance of a trial there is no guarantee that we will be successful in court these outcomes may have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition certain contracts with our suppliers or clients contain provisions whereby we indemnify subject to certain limitations the counterparty for damages suffered as a result of claims related to intellectual property infringement and the use of our data claims made under these provisions could be expensive to litigate and could result in significant payments 

 

we rely on licenses from third parties to certain technology and intellectual property rights for some of our services and the licenses we currently have could terminate or expire 

some of our commercial solutions services rely on technology or intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others our licenses to this technology or these intellectual property rights could be terminated or could expire we may be unable to replace these licenses in a timely manner failure to renew these licenses or renewals of these licenses on less advantageous terms could harm our operating results and financial condition 

our financial results may be adversely affected if we underprice our contracts overrun our cost estimates or fail to receive approval for or experience delays in documenting change orders 

most of our research  development solutions contracts are either fee for service contracts or fixedfee contracts our past financial results have been and our future financial results may be adversely impacted if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates and are unable to successfully negotiate a change order change orders typically occur when the scope of work we perform needs to be modified from that originally contemplated by our contract with the client modifications can occur for example when there is a change in a key clinical trial assumption or parameter or a significant change in timing where we are not successful in converting outofscope work into change orders under our current contracts we bear the cost of the additional work such underpricing significant cost overruns or delay in documentation of change orders could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

the relationship of backlog to revenues varies over time 

backlog on an “ascontracted” basis represents future revenues for our research  development solutions business from work not yet completed or performed under signed binding commitments and signed contracts once work begins on a project revenue is recognized over the duration of the project projects may be terminated or delayed by the client or delayed by regulatory authorities for reasons beyond our control to the extent projects are delayed the timing of our revenue could be affected in the event that a client cancels a contract we typically would be entitled to receive payment for all services performed up to the cancellation date and subsequent clientauthorized services related to terminating the canceled project typically however we have no contractual right to the full amount of the revenue reflected in our backlog in the event of a contract cancellation the duration of the projects included in our backlog and the related revenue recognition range from a few weeks to many years our backlog may not be indicative of our future revenues from our research  development solutions business and we may not realize all the anticipated future revenue reflected in our backlog a number of factors may affect backlog including 

 

  

  

 although an increase in backlog will generally result in an increase in revenues to be recognized over time depending on the level of cancellations an increase in backlog at a particular point in time does not necessarily correspond directly to an increase in revenues during a particular period computing backlog on an “ascontracted basis” rather than an “as awarded” basis may result in additions to the backlog later in the sales cycle than using the “as awarded” basis and may result in different rates of conversion from backlog to revenue than experienced using the “as awarded” basis the extent to which contracts in backlog will result in revenue depends on many factors including but not limited to delivery against projected schedules the need for scope changes change orders contract cancellations and the nature duration size complexity and phase of the contracts each of which factors can vary significantly from time to time 

the rate at which our backlog converts to revenue may vary over time for a variety of reasons the revenue recognition on larger more global projects could be slower than on smaller less global projects for a variety of 

 

reasons including but not limited to an extended period of negotiation between the time the project is awarded to us and the actual execution of the contract as well as an increased timeframe for obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals additionally the increased complexity of clinical trials and the need to enroll precise patient populations could extend the length of clinical trials causing revenue to be recognized over a longer period of time further delayed projects will remain in backlog unless otherwise canceled by the client and will not generate revenue at the rate originally expected thus the relationship of backlog to realized revenues may vary over time 

our business depends on the continued effectiveness and availability of our information systems including the information systems we use to provide our services to our clients and failures of these systems may materially limit our operations 

due to the global nature of our business and our reliance on information systems to provide our services we intend to increase our use of webenabled and other integrated information systems in delivering our services we also provide access to similar information systems to certain of our clients in connection with the services we provide them as the breadth and complexity of our information systems continue to grow we will increasingly be exposed to the risks inherent in the development integration and ongoing operation of evolving information systems including 

 

  

  

 the materialization of any of these risks may impede the processing of data the delivery of databases and services and the daytoday management of our business and could result in the corruption loss or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary confidential or other data while we have disaster recovery plans in place they might not adequately protect us in the event of a system failure while many of our operations have disaster recovery plans in place we currently do not have excess or standby computer processing or network capacity everywhere in the world to avoid disruption in the receipt processing and delivery of data in the event of a system failure despite any precautions we take damage from fire floods hurricanes power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses breakins and similar events at our various computer facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to our servers and from our servers to our clients corruption or loss of data may result in the need to repeat a clinical trial at no cost to the client but at significant cost to us the termination of a contract or damage to our reputation 

in addition any failure by our computer environment to provide sufficient processing or network capacity to transfer data could result in interruptions in our service in the event of a delay in the delivery of data we could be required to transfer our data collection operations to an alternative provider of server hosting services such a transfer could result in significant delays in our ability to deliver services to our clients and increase our costs additionally significant delays in system enhancements or inadequate performance of new or upgraded systems once completed could damage our reputation and harm our business finally longterm disruptions in the infrastructure caused by events such as natural disasters the outbreak of war the escalation of hostilities and acts of terrorism particularly involving cities in which we have offices could adversely affect our businesses although we carry property and business interruption insurance our coverage might not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur 

we have continued to undertake significant programs to optimize business processes with respect to our services our inability to effectively manage the implementation and adapt to new processes designed into new or upgraded systems in a timely and costeffective manner may result in disruption to our business and negatively affect our operations 

 

we have entered into agreements with certain vendors to provide systems development and integration services that develop or license to us the it platform for programs to optimize our business processes if such vendors fail to perform as required or if there are substantial delays in developing implementing and updating the it platform our client delivery may be impaired and we may have to make substantial further investments internally or with third parties to achieve our objectives additionally our progress may be limited by parties with existing or claimed patents who seek to enjoin us from using preferred technology or seek license payments from us meeting our objectives is dependent on a number of factors which may not take place as we anticipate including obtaining adequate technologyenabled services creating itenabled services that our clients will find desirable and implementing our business model with respect to these services also increased itrelated expenditures may negatively impact our profitability 

we may experience challenges with the acquisition development enhancement or deployment of technology necessary for our business 

we operate in businesses that require sophisticated computer systems and software for data collection data processing cloudbased platforms analytics cryptography statistical projections and forecasting mobile computing social media analytics and other applications and technologies particularly our commercial solutions business we seek to address our technology risks by increasing our reliance on the use of innovations by crossindustry technology leaders and adapt these for our biopharmaceutical and healthcare industry clients some of these technologies supporting the industries we serve are changing rapidly and we must continue to adapt to these changes in a timely and effective manner at an acceptable cost we also must continue to deliver data to our clients in forms that are easy to use while simultaneously providing clear answers to complex questions there can be no guarantee that we will be able to develop acquire or integrate new technologies that these new technologies will meet our clients’ needs or achieve expected investment goals or that we will be able to do so as quickly or costeffectively as our competitors significant technological change could render our services obsolete moreover the introduction of new services embodying new technologies could render existing services obsolete our continued success will depend on our ability to adapt to changing technologies manage and process everincreasing amounts of data and information and improve the performance features and reliability of our services in response to changing client and industry demands we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful design development testing introduction or marketing of our services new services or enhancements to existing services may not adequately meet the requirements of current and prospective clients or achieve any degree of significant market acceptance any of these failures could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

consolidation in the industries in which our clients operate may reduce the volume of services purchased by consolidated clients following an acquisition or merger which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 

mergers or consolidations among our clients have in the past and could in the future reduce the number of our clients and potential clients when companies consolidate overlapping services previously purchased separately are usually purchased only once by the combined entity leading to loss of revenue other services that were previously purchased by one of the merged or consolidated entities may be deemed unnecessary or cancelled if our clients merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services there can be no assurance as to the degree to which we may be able to address the revenue impact of such consolidation any of these developments could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by client or therapeutic concentration 

although we did not have any client that represented 10 or more of our revenues in 2016 2015 and 2014 we derive the majority of our revenues from a number of large clients if any large client decreases or terminates its relationship with us our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

 

additionally conducting multiple clinical trials for different clients in a single therapeutic class involving drugs with the same or similar chemical action has in the past and may in the future adversely affect our business if some or all of the clinical trials are canceled because of new scientific information or regulatory judgments that affect the drugs as a class or if industry consolidation results in the rationalization of drug development pipelines similarly marketing and selling drugs for different biopharmaceutical companies with similar chemical actions subjects us to risk if new scientific information or regulatory judgment prejudices the drugs as a class which may lead to compelled or voluntary prescription limitations or withdrawal of some or all of such drugs from the market 

our business is subject to international economic political and other risks that could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we have significant operations in countries that may require complex arrangements to deliver services throughout the world for our clients additionally we have established operations in locations remote from our most developed business centers as a result we are subject to heightened risks inherent in conducting business internationally including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these risks and uncertainties could negatively impact our ability to among other things perform large global projects for our clients furthermore our ability to deal with these issues could be affected by applicable united states laws and the need to protect our assets any such risks could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

exchange rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial condition 

because a large portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar and our financial statements are reported in united states dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition exchange rate fluctuations between local currencies and the united states dollar create risk in several ways including 

 

  

 we may limit these risks through exchange rate fluctuation provisions stated in our service contracts or we may hedge our transaction risk with foreign currency exchange contracts or options we have not however hedged all of our foreign currency transaction risk and we may experience fluctuations in financial results from our operations outside the united states and foreign currency transaction risk associated with our service contracts 

due to the global nature of our business we may be exposed to liabilities under the united states foreign corrupt practices act and various nonunited states anticorruption laws and any allegation or determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are required to comply with the fcpa and other united states and nonunited states anticorruption laws which prohibit companies from engaging in bribery including corruptly or improperly offering promising or providing money or anything else of value to nonunited states officials and certain other recipients in addition the fcpa imposes certain books records and accounting control obligations on public companies and other issuers we operate in parts of the world in which corruption can be common and compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices our global operations face the risk of unauthorized payments or offers being made by employees consultants sales agents and other business partners outside of our control or without our authorization it is our policy to implement safeguards to prohibit these practices by our employees and business partners with respect to our operations however irrespective of these safeguards or as a result of monitoring compliance with such safeguards it is possible that we or certain other parties may discover or receive information at some point that certain employees consultants sales agents or other business partners may have engaged in corrupt conduct for which we might be held responsible violations of the fcpa or other nonunited states anticorruption laws may result in restatements of or irregularities in our financial statements as well as severe criminal or civil sanctions and we may be subject to other liabilities which could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition in some cases companies that violate the fcpa may be debarred by the united states government andor lose their united states export privileges changes in anticorruption laws or enforcement priorities could also result in increased compliance requirements and related costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in 

 

addition the united states or other governments may seek to hold us liable for successor liability fcpa violations or violations of other anticorruption laws committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquired or will acquire 

we face risks related to sales to government entities 

we derive a portion of our revenue from sales to government entities in the united states in general our contracts with united states government entities are terminable at will by the government entity at any time government demand and payment for our services may be affected by publicsector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations government contracts are subject to oversight including special rules on accounting expenses reviews and security failure to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions including termination of contracts fines and suspensions or debarment from future business with the united states government as a result failure to comply with these rules could have an adverse effect on our future business reputation operating results and financial condition 

if we are unable to successfully develop and market new services or enter new markets our growth results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

a key element of our growth strategy is the successful development and marketing of new services or entering new markets that complement or expand our existing business as we develop new services or enter new markets including services targeted at participants in the broader healthcare industry we may not have or adequately build the competencies necessary to perform such services satisfactorily may not receive market acceptance for such services or may face increased competition if we are unable to succeed in developing new services entering new markets or attracting a client base for our new services or in new markets we will be unable to implement this element of our growth strategy and our future business reputation results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our research  development solutions business could subject us to potential liability that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our research  development solutions business involves the testing of new drugs on patients in clinical trials and if marketing approval is granted the availability of these drugs to be prescribed to patients our involvement in the clinical trials and development process creates a risk of liability for personal injury to or death of patients particularly those with lifethreatening illnesses resulting from adverse reactions to the drugs administered during testing or after product launch respectively for example we have from time to time been sued and may be sued in the future by individuals alleging personal injury due to their participation in clinical trials and seeking damages from us under a variety of legal theories although we maintain the types and amounts of insurance we view as customary in the industries and countries in which we operate if we are required to pay damages or incur defense costs in connection with any personal injury claim that is outside the scope of indemnification agreements we have with our clients if any indemnification agreement is not performed in accordance with its terms or if our liability exceeds the amount of any applicable indemnification limits or available insurance coverage our financial condition results of operations and reputation could be materially and adversely affected we maintain professional liability insurance including liability for completed operations coverage in the future we may not be able to get adequate insurance for these types of risks at reasonable rates 

we also contract with physicians to serve as investigators in conducting clinical trials if the investigators commit errors or make omissions during a clinical trial that result in harm to clinical trial patients or after a clinical trial to a patient using the drug after it has received regulatory approval claims for personal injury or liability damages may result additionally if the investigators engage in fraudulent behavior clinical trial data may be compromised which may require us to repeat the clinical trial or subject us to liability we do not believe we are legally responsible for the medical care rendered by such thirdparty investigators and we would 

 

vigorously defend any claims brought against us however it is possible we could be found liable for claims with respect to the actions of thirdparty investigators which may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

some of our research  development solutions services involve direct interaction with clinical trial subjects or volunteers and operation of phase i clinical facilities which could create potential liability that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we operate facilities where phase i clinical trials are conducted which ordinarily involve testing an investigational drug on a limited number of healthy individuals typically 20 to 80 persons to determine such drug’s basic safety failure to operate such a facility in accordance with applicable regulations could result in that facility being shut down which could disrupt our operations additionally we face risks associated with adverse events resulting from the administration of such drugs to healthy volunteers and the professional malpractice of medical care providers occasionally physicians employed at our phase i clinical facilities act as principal investigators in laterphase clinical trials at those same facilities we also directly employ nurses and other trained employees who assist in implementing the testing involved in our clinical trials such as drawing blood from healthy volunteers any professional malpractice or negligence by such investigators nurses or other employees could potentially result in liability to us in the event of personal injury to or death of a healthy volunteer in clinical trials this liability particularly if it were to exceed the limits of any indemnification agreements and insurance coverage we may have may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

our integrated engagement services business could result in liability to us if a drug causes harm to a patient while we are generally indemnified and insured against such risks we may still suffer financial losses 

when we market drugs under contract for a biopharmaceutical company we could suffer liability for harm allegedly caused by those drugs either as a result of a lawsuit against the biopharmaceutical company to which we are joined a lawsuit naming us or any of our subsidiaries or an action launched by a regulatory body while we are generally indemnified by the biopharmaceutical company for the action of the drugs we market on its behalf and we carry insurance to cover harm caused by our negligence in performing services it is possible that we could nonetheless incur financial losses regulatory penalties or both in particular any claim could result in potential liability for us if the claim is outside the scope of the indemnification agreement we have with the biopharmaceutical company the biopharmaceutical company does not abide by the indemnification agreement as required or the liability exceeds the amount of any applicable indemnification limits or available insurance coverage such a finding could have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and reputation furthermore negative publicity associated with harm caused by drugs we helped to market could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

our insurance may not cover all of our indemnification obligations and other liabilities associated with our operations 

we maintain insurance designed to provide coverage for ordinary risks associated with our operations and our ordinary indemnification obligations the coverage provided by such insurance may not be adequate for all claims we may make or may be contested by our insurance carriers if our insurance is not adequate or available to pay liabilities associated with our operations or if we are unable to purchase adequate insurance at reasonable rates in the future our profitability may be adversely impacted 

if we are unable to attract suitable investigators and patients for our clinical trials our clinical development business might suffer 

the timely recruitment of investigators and patients for clinical trials is essential to our research  development solutions business investigators are typically located at hospitals clinics or other sites and supervise 

 

the administration of the investigational drug to patients during the course of a clinical trial patients generally include people from the communities in which the clinical trials are conducted our clinical development business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract suitable and willing investigators or patients for clinical trials on a consistent basis for example if we are unable to engage investigators to conduct clinical trials as planned or enroll sufficient patients in clinical trials we might need to expend additional funds to obtain access to resources or else be compelled to delay or modify the clinical trial plans which may result in additional costs to us 

if we lose the services of key personnel or are unable to recruit additional qualified personnel our business could be adversely affected 

our success substantially depends on the collective performance contributions and expertise of our personnel including senior management and key personnel qualified professional scientific and technical operating staff and qualified sales representatives for our contract sales services there is significant and increasing competition for qualified personnel particularly those with higher educational degrees such as a medical degree a phd or an equivalent degree or relevant experience in the industry and in the locations in which we operate in addition the departure of our key employees or our inability to continue to identify attract and retain qualified personnel or replace any departed personnel in a timely fashion may impact our ability to grow our business and compete effectively in our industry and may negatively affect our ability to meet financial and operational goals 

disruptions in the credit and capital markets and unfavorable general economic conditions could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

disruptions in the credit and capital markets could have negative effects on our business that may be difficult to predict or anticipate including the ability of our clients vendors contractors and financing sources to meet their contractual obligations although we are unable to quantify the impact it has had on us we are aware of a limited number of instances in our research  development solutions business during the past several years where cancellations changes in scope and failure to pay timely were attributable at least in part to difficulty in our clients’ ability to obtain financing in the future such actions by our clients could if they involve a significant amount of business with us have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our effective income tax rate may fluctuate which may adversely affect our operations earnings and earnings per share 

our effective income tax rate is influenced by our projected profitability in the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate changes in the distribution of profits and losses among taxing jurisdictions may have a significant impact on our effective income tax rate which in turn could have an adverse effect on our net income and earnings per share factors that may affect our effective income tax rate include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

these changes may cause fluctuations in our effective income tax rate that could adversely affect our results of operations and cause fluctuations in our earnings and earnings per share additional information regarding our income taxes is presented in note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

our relationships with existing or potential clients who are in competition with each other may adversely impact the degree to which other clients or potential clients use our services which may adversely affect our results of operations 

the biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive with biopharmaceutical companies each seeking to persuade payers providers and patients that their drug therapies are better and more costeffective than competing therapies marketed or being developed by competing firms in addition to the adverse competitive interests that biopharmaceutical companies have with each other biopharmaceutical companies also have adverse interests with respect to drug selection and reimbursement with other participants in the healthcare industry including payers and providers biopharmaceutical companies also compete to be first to market with new drug therapies we regularly provide services to biopharmaceutical companies who compete with each other and we sometimes provide services or funding to such clients regarding competing drugs in development our existing or future relationships with our biopharmaceutical clients may therefore deter other biopharmaceutical clients from using our services or may result in our clients seeking to place limits on our ability to serve other biopharmaceutical industry participants in connection with drug development activities in addition our further expansion into the broader healthcare market may adversely impact our relationships with biopharmaceutical clients and such clients may elect not to use our services reduce the scope of services that we provide to them or seek to place restrictions on our ability to serve clients in the broader healthcare market with interests that are adverse to theirs a loss of clients or reductions in the level of revenues from a client could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations business and prospects 

if we are unable to successfully identify acquire and integrate existing businesses services and technologies our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 

we anticipate that a portion of our future growth may come from acquiring existing businesses services or technologies the success of any acquisition will depend upon among other things our ability to effectively integrate acquired personnel operations services and technologies into our business and to retain the key personnel and clients of our acquired businesses in addition we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or obtain any necessary financing on commercially acceptable terms we may also spend time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition targets but not complete the transaction any future acquisition could involve other risks including among others the assumption of additional liabilities and expenses difficulties and expenses in connection with integrating the acquired companies and achieving the expected benefits issuances of potentially dilutive securities or interestbearing debt loss of key employees of the acquired companies transaction costs diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and with respect to the acquisition of foreign companies the inability to overcome differences in foreign business practices language and customs our failure to identify potential acquisitions complete targeted acquisitions and integrate completed acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

investments in our clients’ businesses or drugs and our related commercial rights strategies could have a negative impact on our financial performance 

we may enter into arrangements with our clients or other drug companies in which we take on some of the risk of the potential success or failure of their businesses or drugs including making strategic investments in our clients or other drug companies providing financing to clients or other drug companies or acquiring an interest in the revenues from clients’ drugs or in entities developing a limited number of drugs our financial results would be adversely affected if these investments or the underlying drugs result in losses or do not achieve the level of success that we anticipate andor our return or payment from the drug investment or financing is less than our direct and indirect costs with respect to these arrangements 

 

our results of operations may be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our goodwill and intangible assets 

we assess the realizability of our indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill annually and conduct an interim evaluation whenever events or changes in circumstances such as operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset indicate that these assets may be impaired for example we recognized 28 million of impairment losses during the year ended december 31 2016 for goodwill and intangible assets in our encore reporting unit our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of the businesses we have acquired which in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses into our own business if we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets such impairment charges could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we face risks arising from the restructuring of our operations 

from time to time we have adopted restructuring plans to improve our operating efficiency through various means such as reduction of overcapacity elimination of nonbillable support roles or other realignment of resources in addition we have provided guidance of cost synergies of annualized savings exiting 2019 of 200 million in connection with the merger restructuring presents significant potential risks of events occurring that could adversely affect us including 

 

  

  

  

  

 further any such restructuring would result in charges that if material could harm our results of operations and significantly reduce our cash position or increase debt in addition we may incur certain unforeseen costs once any restructuring activities are implemented further if we determine to effect any restructuring we can give no assurance that any projected cost reductions resulting from such restructuring activities will be achieved within the expected timeframe or at all 

because of these and other factors we cannot predict whether we will realize the purpose and anticipated benefits of these measures and if we do not our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

additionally there may be delays in implementing the restructuring activities or a failure to achieve the anticipated levels of cost savings and efficiency as a result of the restructuring activities each of which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations further restructuring or reorganization activities may also be required in the future beyond what is currently planned which could further enhance the risks associated with these activities 

risks relating to our industry 

the biopharmaceutical services industry is highly competitive 

the biopharmaceutical services industry is highly competitive our business often competes with other biopharmaceutical services companies internal discovery departments development departments sales and marketing departments information technology departments and other departments within our clients some of 

 

which could be considered large biopharmaceutical services companies in their own right with greater resources than ours we also compete with universities teaching hospitals governments agencies and others if we do not compete successfully our business will suffer the industry is highly fragmented with numerous smaller specialized companies and a handful of companies with global capabilities similar to certain of our own capabilities increased competition has led to price and other forms of competition such as acceptance of less favorable contract terms that could adversely affect our operating results there are few barriers to entry for companies considering offering any one or more of the services we offer because of their size and focus these companies might compete effectively against us which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our future growth and success will depend on our ability to successfully compete with other companies that provide similar services in the same markets some of which may have financial marketing technical and other advantages we also expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of consolidation among these various companies large technology companies with substantial resources technical expertise and greater brand power could also decide to enter or further expand in the markets where our business operates and compete with us if one or more of our competitors or potential competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors or if a new entrant emerged with substantial resources the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively we compete on the basis of various factors including breadth and depth of services reputation reliability quality innovation security price and industry expertise and experience in addition our ability to compete successfully may be impacted by the growing availability of health information from social media government health information systems and other free or lowcost sources for example the united kingdom’s national health service started releasing large volumes of data beginning in december 2011 at little or no charge reducing the demand for our information services derived from similar data in addition consolidation or integration of wholesalers retail pharmacies health networks payers or other healthcare stakeholders may lead any of them to provide information services directly to clients or indirectly through a designated service provider resulting in increased competition from firms that may have lower costs to market eg no data supply costs any of the above may result in lower demand for our services which could result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

outsourcing trends in the biopharmaceutical industry and changes in aggregate spending and research and development budgets could adversely affect our operating results and growth rate 

economic factors and industry trends that affect biopharmaceutical companies affect our research  development solutions business biopharmaceutical companies continue to seek longterm strategic collaborations with global contract research organizations with favorable pricing terms competition for these collaborations is intense and we may decide to forego an opportunity or we may not be selected in which case a competitor may enter into the collaboration and our business with the client if any may be limited in addition if the biopharmaceutical industry reduces its outsourcing of clinical trials and sales and marketing projects or such outsourcing fails to grow at projected rates our operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected we may also be negatively impacted by consolidation and other factors in the biopharmaceutical industry which may slow decision making by our clients or result in the delay or cancellation of clinical trials our commercial services may be affected by reductions in new drug launches and increases in the number of drugs losing patent protection all of these events could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our business may be materially and adversely impacted by factors affecting the biopharmaceutical and healthcare industries 

the vast majority of our revenue is generated from sales to the biopharmaceutical and healthcare industries the clients we serve in these industries are commonly subject to financial pressures including but not limited to increased costs reduced demand for their products reductions in pricing and reimbursement for products and services formulary approval and placement government approval to market their products and limits on the manner by which they market their products loss of patent exclusivity whether due to patent 

 

expiration or as a result of a successful legal challenge and the proliferation of or changes to regulations applicable to these industries to the extent our clients face such pressures or they change how they utilize our offerings the demand for our services or the prices our clients are willing to pay for those services may decline any such decline could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we may be affected by healthcare reform and potential additional reforms 

the united states congress continues to consider healthcare reform legislation and impose health industry cost containment measures which may significantly impact the biopharmaceutical industry in addition numerous government bodies are considering or have adopted various healthcare reforms and may undertake or are in the process of undertaking efforts to control growing healthcare costs through legislation regulation and voluntary agreements with medical care providers and biopharmaceutical companies we are uncertain as to the effects of these recent reforms on our business and are unable to predict what legislative proposals if any will be adopted in the future if regulatory cost containment efforts limit the profitability of new drugs our clients may reduce their research and development spending or promotional marketing and sales expenditures which could reduce the business they outsource to us similarly if regulatory requirements are relaxed or simplified drug approval procedures are adopted the demand for our services could decrease 

foreign and domestic government bodies may also adopt healthcare legislation or regulations that are more burdensome than existing regulations for example product safety concerns and recommendations by the drug safety oversight board could change the regulatory environment for drug products and new or heightened regulatory and licensing requirements may increase our expenses or limit or delay our ability to offer some of our services additionally new or heightened regulatory requirements may have a negative impact on the ability of our clients to conduct industrysponsored clinical trials which could reduce the need for our services 

actions by government regulators or clients to limit a prescription’s scope or withdraw an approved drug from the market could adversely affect our business and result in a loss of revenues 

government regulators have the authority after approving a drug to regulate or limit its scope of prescription or withdraw it from the market completely based on safety concerns similarly clients may act to voluntarily limit the scope of prescription of drugs or withdraw them from the market in the past we have provided services with respect to drugs that have been limited andor withdrawn if we are providing services to clients for drugs that are limited or withdrawn we may be required to narrow the scope of or terminate our services with respect to such drugs which would prevent earning the full amount of revenues anticipated under the related service contracts with negative impacts to our financial results 

if we do not keep pace with rapid technological changes our services may become less competitive or obsolete 

the biopharmaceutical industry is subject to rapid technological changes our current competitors or other businesses might develop technologies or services that are more effective or commercially attractive than or render obsolete our current or future technologies and services if our competitors introduce superior technologies or services and if we cannot make enhancements to remain competitive our competitive position would be harmed if we are unable to compete successfully we may lose clients or be unable to attract new clients which could lead to a decrease in our revenue and financial condition 

laws restricting biopharmaceutical sales and marketing practices may adversely impact demand for our services 

there have been a significant number of laws legislative initiatives and regulatory actions over the years that seek to limit biopharmaceutical sales and marketing practices for example three states in 2006 and 2007 passed laws restricting the use of prescriber identifiable information for the purpose of promoting branded 

 

prescription medicines although these laws were subsequently declared to be unconstitutional based on a decision of the us supreme court in sorrell v ims health in 2011 we are unable to predict whether and in what form other initiatives may be introduced or actions taken at the state or federal levels to limit biopharmaceutical sales and marketing practices in addition while we will continue to seek to adapt our services to comply with the requirements of these laws to the extent applicable to our services if enacted there can be no assurance that our efforts to adapt our offerings will be successful and provide the same financial contribution to us there can also be no assurance that future legislative initiatives will not adversely affect our ability to develop or market current or future offerings or that any future laws will not diminish the demand for our services all of which could over time result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

our research  development solutions clients face intense competition from lower cost generic products which may lower the amount that they spend on our services 

our research  development solutions clients face increasing competition from lower cost generic products which in turn may affect their ability to pursue research and development activities with us in the united states eu and japan political pressure to reduce spending on prescription drugs has led to legislation and other measures which encourages the use of generic products in addition proposals emerge from time to time in the united states and other countries for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by generic substitutes reducing our clients’ sales of that product and their overall profitability availability of generic substitutes for our clients’ drugs may adversely affect their results of operations and cash flow which in turn may mean that they would not have surplus capital to invest in research and development and drug commercialization including in our services if competition from generic products impacts our clients’ finances such that they decide to curtail our services our revenues may decline and this could have a material adverse effect on our business 

risks relating to our indebtedness 

restrictions imposed in the senior secured credit facilities and other outstanding indebtedness including the indentures governing quintiles ims holdings inc outstanding notes may limit our ability to operate our business and to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 

the terms of the senior secured credit facilities restrict quintilesims and its restricted subsidiaries from engaging in specified types of transactions these covenants restrict the ability of quintilesims and its restricted subsidiaries among other things to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the revolving credit facility and the new term loans under our senior secured credit facility require quintilesims to comply with a quarterly maximum senior secured net leverage ratio test and minimum interest coverage ratio test which become more restrictive over time quintilesims’s ability to comply with these financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and quintilesims may not be able to satisfy them additionally the restrictions contained in the indentures governing the outstanding notes could also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions meet capital needs or make acquisitions or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facilities or the indentures governing the outstanding notes which could trigger acceleration of our indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of or default under any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial results in the event of any default under the senior secured credit facilities the applicable lenders could elect to terminate borrowing commitments and declare all borrowings and loans outstanding together with accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and other obligations to be due and payable in addition or in the alternative the applicable lenders could exercise their rights under the security documents entered into in connection with the senior secured credit facilities quintilesims and the other subsidiary guarantors have pledged substantially all of their tangible and intangible assets subject to customary exceptions as collateral under the senior secured credit facilities including the stock and the assets of certain of our current and future wholly owned united states subsidiaries and a portion of the stock of certain of our nonunited states subsidiaries 

if we were unable to repay or otherwise refinance these borrowings and loans when due the applicable lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation in the event the applicable lenders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness any acceleration of amounts due under the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities or the exercise by the applicable lenders of their rights under the security documents would likely have a material adverse effect on us 

despite our level of indebtedness we are able to incur more debt and undertake additional obligations incurring such debt or undertaking such additional obligations could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition 

although our credit agreement which governs the senior credit facilities of our wholly owned subsidiary through which we conduct our operations quintiles ims incorporated “opco” contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could increase in addition the receivables financing agreement for our special purpose subsidiary quintiles funding llc “quintiles funding” limits borrowing based on the amount of receivables purchased by quintiles funding from certain of our other subsidiaries but when supported by the value of such purchased receivables the debt under our receivables financing facility can increase 

while the credit agreement also contains restrictions on our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to make loans and investments these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the investments incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 

 

restrictive covenants in our other indebtedness may limit our flexibility in our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to pursue our business strategies 

the terms contained in certain of our indebtedness including credit facilities and any future indebtedness of ours may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions including restrictions on our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to take actions that we believe may be in our interest these agreements among other things limit our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a breach of the covenants or restrictions under the agreements governing our other indebtedness could result in a default under the applicable indebtedness such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in the event our lenders and noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we cannot assure that we and our subsidiaries would have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness 

our financial results our substantial indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of future financing 

interest rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial condition 

because we have variable rate debt fluctuations in interest rates affect our business we attempt to minimize interest rate risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate caps and swaps we have entered into interest rate caps and swaps with financial institutions that have reset dates and critical terms that match those of our senior secured term loan credit facility accordingly any change in market value associated with the interest rate caps and swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt because we do not attempt to hedge all of our variable rate debt we may incur higher interest costs for the portion of our variable rate debt which is not hedged 

 

risks relating to ownership of our common stock 

the parties to the shareholders agreement continue to have significant influence over us after the merger including control over decisions that require the approval of stockholders which could limit the ability of other stockholders to influence the outcome of matters submitted to stockholders for a vote 

as of february 9 2017 certain of the largest postmerger stockholders own approximately 414 of the outstanding shares of our common stock these stockholders are parties to a shareholders agreement dated may 3 2016 the “shareholders agreement” that superseded and replaced the quintiles’ amended and restated shareholders agreement dated february 5 2015 and the quintiles’ second amended and restated registration rights agreement dated may 14 2013 as amended and the ims health amended and restated shareholders agreement dated as of april 9 2014 

the parties to the shareholders agreement other than dr dennis gillings and certain of his affiliates the “dg shareholders” who have agreed separately to vote in favor of the merger and the transactions contemplated thereby have agreed to vote for individuals designated to the surviving corporation board of directors upon completion of the merger as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the shareholders agreement provides that we will use our best efforts to cause dr gillings to be elected as the lead director through our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders and to be elected as a director so that he may serve as a director until the day after our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders provided that the dg shareholders as a group continue to beneficially own at least 25 of our outstanding common stock including using its best efforts to support his nomination for the slate of director nominees for a threeyear term at our 2017 and 2020 annual meetings of stockholders 

as a result the parties to the shareholders agreement potentially have the ability to influence decisions of our company to enter into any corporate transaction and the terms thereof any change in the composition of our board of directors and any transaction that requires stockholder approval regardless of whether others believe that such change or transaction is in the best interests of our company additionally the parties to the shareholders agreement are in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us one or more of the parties to the shareholders agreement may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our businesses and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us so long as the parties to the shareholders agreement continue to own a significant amount of our equity if they exercise their stockholder rights collectively they will be able to significantly influence our decisions 

 

provisions of the corporate governance documents of quintilesims could make an acquisition of quintilesims difficult and may prevent attempts by its stockholders to replace or remove its management even if beneficial to its stockholders 

in addition to the beneficial ownership of a large percentage of quintilesims common stock by the parties to the shareholders agreement our certificate of incorporation and delaware bylaws and the general corporation law of delaware “dgcl” contain provisions that could make it difficult for a third party to acquire quintilesims even if doing so might be beneficial to its stockholders including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition quintilesims is subject to section 203 of the dgcl regulating corporate takeovers although our board of directors adopted a resolution approving the merger pursuant to which shares of common stock were acquired by among others the tpg shareholders section 203 subject to certain exceptions prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any “business combination” with any “interested stockholder” for a period of three years following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder unless 

 

  

  

 in general section 203 defines “business combination” to include mergers or consolidations between a delaware corporation and an interested stockholder transactions with an interested stockholder involving the 

 

assets or stock of the corporation or its majorityowned subsidiaries and transactions which increase an interested stockholder’s percentage ownership of stock in general section 203 defines an “interested stockholder” as any entity or person beneficially owning 15 or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by stockholders to replace members of the board of directors because quintilesims’s board is responsible for appointing the members of management these provisions could in turn affect any attempt to replace current members of management as a result stockholders of quintilesims may lose their ability to sell their stock for a price in excess of the prevailing market price due to these protective measures and efforts by stockholders to change the direction or management of quintilesims may be unsuccessful 

our operating results and share price may be volatile which could cause the value of our stockholders’ investments to decline 

our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future and such fluctuations may be significant in addition securities markets worldwide have experienced and are likely to continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could subject the market price of our shares to wide price fluctuations regardless of our operating performance our operating results and the trading price of our shares may fluctuate in response to various factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these and other factors many of which are beyond our control may cause our operating results and the market price for our shares to fluctuate substantially while we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares and may otherwise negatively affect the market price and liquidity of our shares in addition in the past when the market price of a stock has been volatile holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock if any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation 

there may be sales of a substantial amount of our common stock by our current stockholders and these sales could cause the price of our common stock to fall 

as of february 9 2017 there were 235719111 shares of common stock outstanding approximately 414 of the outstanding shares of our common stock is held by parties to the shareholders agreement 

 

sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales will occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for us to raise funds through securities offerings in the future for example as restrictions on resale end the market price of our common stock could decline if the holders of currently restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them 

stockholders that are a party to the shareholders agreement may require us to register their shares for resale under the federal securities laws subject to certain requirements under the shareholders agreement we are required to pay the registration expenses associated with the registration of such shares not including the underwriting discounts commissions and transfer taxes registration of those shares would allow those stockholders to immediately resell their shares in the public market any such sales or the anticipation of such sales may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

in addition we may use our cash cash generated from operations or dispositions of assets or businesses andor proceeds from any new financing arrangements or issuances of debt or equity securities to repurchase shares including the repurchase of shares from our stockholders that are a party to the shareholders agreement 

since we have no current plans to pay regular cash dividends on our common stock stockholders may not receive any return on investment unless they sell their common stock for a price greater than that which they paid for it 

although we have previously declared dividends to our stockholders prior to our initial public offering in may 2013 we do not currently anticipate paying any regular cash dividends on our common stock any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board and will depend on among other things our results of operations financial condition cash requirements contractual restrictions and other factors that our board may deem relevant in addition our ability to pay dividends is and may be limited by covenants of existing and any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur including under our existing credit facilities therefore any return on investment in our common stock is solely dependent upon the appreciation of the price of our common stock on the open market which may not occur 

our certificate of incorporation contains a provision renouncing any interest and expectancy in certain corporate opportunities identified by certain of our affiliates even if such corporate opportunities are ones that we might reasonably be deemed to have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue 

our certificate of incorporation provides that our company renounces any interest or expectancy in the business opportunities of the tpg shareholders the bain shareholders cpp investment board private holdings inc “cpp shareholder” and leonard green  partners lp “lgp shareholders” and their affiliates other than our company and our subsidiaries and all of their respective partners principals directors officers members managers managing directors andor employees and each such person will have no obligation to offer us such opportunities this provision applies to these stockholders and associated parties only for so long as a nominee designated by the stockholder under the shareholders agreement continues to serve on the board stockholders are deemed to have notice of and have consented to this provision of our certificate of incorporation 

therefore a director or officer of our company who also serves as a director officer member manager or employee of such stockholders may pursue certain business opportunities including acquisitions that may be complementary to its business and as a result such opportunities may not be available to us these potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on the business financial condition results of operations or prospects of our company if attractive corporate opportunities are allocated by such stockholders to themselves or their other affiliates instead of to us 

 

risks relating to the merger 

quintilesims may be unable to fully realize the competitive and operating synergies that are projected to be achieved through the combination of quintiles’ services and ims health’s offerings 

part of the strategic rationale for the merger is the opportunity for us to potentially drive additional revenue and earnings through the utilization by quintiles of ims health’s data assets and capabilities in accelerating clinical trials however the utilization of data in the two companies’ markets is still evolving and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 we are unable to predict the extent to which these factors will inhibit our business plans and any one of them could result in decreased or delays in our performance 

we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the merger or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected we may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating the two businesses 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate the two businesses the combination of two independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result we are required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating their business practices and operations the integration process may disrupt the businesses and if implemented ineffectively would restrict the realization of the fullexpected benefits the failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in the activities of quintilesims and could adversely affect the results of operations of quintilesims 

in addition the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of client relationships and diversion of management’s attention the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations in addition even if the operations of the businesses of quintiles and ims health are integrated successfully the full benefits of the transaction may not be realized including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are expected these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all further additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses of quintiles and ims health all of these factors could negatively impact our earnings per share decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the transaction and negatively impact the price of our shares as a result there is no assurance that the combination of quintiles and ims health will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the merger 

the future results of quintilesims will suffer if we do not effectively manage its expanded operations following the completion of the merger 

following the completion of the merger the size of the business of quintilesims increased significantly beyond the current size of either quintiles’ or ims health’s business our future success depends in part upon our ability to manage this expanded business which poses substantial challenges for management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity if we are unsuccessful in managing our integrated operations or if we do not realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the merger the operations and financial condition of quintilesims could be adversely affected and we may not be able to take advantage of business development opportunities 

if the merger does not qualify as a reorganization under section 368a of the internal revenue code ims health and the ims health stockholders may be required to pay substantial united states federal income taxes 

it was a condition of the merger that legal opinions from tax counsel were received that the merger will be treated for united states federal income tax purposes as a “reorganization” within the meaning of section 368a of the internal revenue code these opinions were based on certain assumptions and representations as to factual matters from quintiles and ims health as well as certain covenants and undertakings by quintiles and ims health if any of the assumptions representations covenants or undertakings is incorrect incomplete inaccurate or is violated in any material respect the validity of the conclusions reached by tax counsel would be jeopardized additionally an opinion of counsel is not binding on the internal revenue service “irs” or any court so there can be no certainty that the irs will not challenge the conclusions reflected in the opinions or that a court will not sustain such a challenge if the irs or a court determines that the merger should not be treated as a “reorganization” a holder of ims health common stock that is a united states holder would generally recognize a gain or loss upon the exchange of ims health common stock for quintilesims common stock pursuant to the merger in addition if the merger is not treated as a “reorganization” ims health would recognize a gain or loss measured generally by the difference between the fair market value of ims health’s assets and ims health’s adjusted tax basis in such assets 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

none 




 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2016 we had approximately 273 offices located in approximately 82 countries our executive headquarters are located adjacent to research triangle park north carolina and in danbury connecticut we own facilities in barcelona spain buenos aires argentina caracas venezuela los ruices venezuela lisbon portugal and bangalore india all of our other offices are leased our properties are 

 

geographically distributed to meet our worldwide operating requirements and none of our properties are individually material to our business operations many of our leases have an option to renew and we believe that we will be able to successfully renew expiring leases on terms satisfactory to us we believe that our facilities are adequate for our operations and that suitable additional space will be available if needed 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in a variety of legal and tax proceedings claims and litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business these actions may be commenced by various parties including competitors clients current or former employees government agencies or others we record a provision with respect to a proceeding claim or litigation when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated however even in instances where we have recorded an estimated liability we are unable to predict with certainty the final outcome of the matter or whether resolution of the matter will materially affect our operating results financial position or cash flows as additional information becomes available we adjust our assessment and estimates of such liabilities accordingly 

further we routinely enter into agreements with our suppliers to acquire data and with our clients to sell data all in the normal course of business in these agreements we sometimes agree to indemnify and hold harmless the other party for any damages such other party may suffer as a result of potential intellectual property infringement and other claims related to the use of the data we have not accrued liability with respect to these matters as the exposure is considered remote 

based on our review of the latest information available management does not expect the impact of pending legal and tax proceedings claims and litigation either individually or in the aggregate to have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial position or cash flows however one or more unfavorable outcomes in any claim or litigation against us could have a material adverse effect for the period in which it is resolved the following is a summary of the more significant legal matters involving the company 

our whollyowned subsidiary ims government solutions inc is primarily engaged in providing services under contracts with the united states government united states government contracts are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements and from time to time agencies of the united states government have the ability to investigate whether contractors’ operations are being conducted in accordance with such requirements ims government solutions discovered potential noncompliance with various contract clauses and requirements under its general services administration contract the “gsa contract” which was awarded in 2002 to its predecessor company synchronous knowledge inc synchronous knowledge inc was acquired by ims health in may 2005 the potential noncompliance arose from two primary areas first at the direction of the government work performed under one task order was invoiced under another task order without the appropriate modifications to the orders being made and second personnel who did not meet strict compliance with the labor categories component of the qualification requirements of the gsa contract were assigned to contracts upon discovery of the potential noncompliance we began remediation efforts promptly disclosed the potential noncompliance to the united states government and were accepted into the department of defense voluntary disclosure program we filed a voluntary disclosure program report on august 29 2008 we are currently unable to determine the outcome of all of these matters pending the resolution of the voluntary disclosure program process and the ultimate liability arising from these matters could exceed our current reserves 

on february 13 2014 a group of approximately 1200 medical doctors and 900 private individuals filed a civil lawsuit with the seoul central district court against ims korea and two other defendants kpa and the korean pharmaceutical information center “kpic” the civil lawsuit alleges kpa and kpic collected their personal information in violation of applicable privacy laws without the necessary consent through a software system installed on pharmacy computer systems in korea and that personal information was transferred to ims korea and sold to pharmaceutical companies the plaintiffs are claiming damages in the aggregate amount of approximately 6 million plus interest we believe the lawsuit is without merit reject plaintiffs’ claims and intend to vigorously defend our position 

 

on july 23 2015 indictments were issued by the seoul central district prosecutors’ office in south korea against 24 individuals and companies alleging improper handling of sensitive health information in violation of among others south korea’s personal information protection act ims korea and two of its employees were among the individuals and organizations indicted although there is no assertion that ims korea used patient identified health information in any of its offerings prosecutors allege that certain of ims korea’s data suppliers should have obtained patient consent when they converted sensitive patient information into nonidentified data and that ims korea had not taken adequate precautions to reduce the risk of reidentification we believe the indictment is without merit that we acted in compliance with all applicable laws at all times and intend to vigorously defend our position

purchases of equity securities by the issuer 

on october 30 2013 our board approved an equity repurchase program “repurchase program” authorizing the repurchase of up to 125 million of either our common stock or vested inthemoney employee stock options or a combination thereof during 2015 our board increased the share repurchase authorization under the repurchase program by 600 million which increased the total amount that has been authorized under the repurchase program to 725 million on november 1 2016 our board increased the stock repurchase authorization under the repurchase program by 15 billion which increased the total amount that has been authorized under the repurchase program to 2225 billion the repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any particular amount of common stock or vested inthemoney employee stock options and it could be modified extended suspended or discontinued at any time the timing and amount of repurchases are determined by our management based on a variety of factors such as the market price of our common stock our corporate requirements and overall market conditions purchases of our common stock may be made in open market transactions effected through a brokerdealer at prevailing market prices in block trades or in privately negotiated transactions we may also repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to a trading plan meeting the requirements of rule 10b51 under the exchange act which would permit shares of our common stock to be repurchased when we might otherwise be precluded from doing so by law repurchases of vested inthemoney employee stock options were made through transactions between us and our employees other than our executive officers who were not eligible to participate in the program and this aspect of the repurchase program expired in november 2013 the repurchase program for common stock does not have an end date 

from inception through december 31 2016 we have repurchased a total of 1678 million of our securities under the repurchase program consisting of 59 million of stock options and 1619 million of common stock as of december 31 2016 we have remaining authorization to repurchase up to 547 million of our common stock under the repurchase program in addition from time to time we have repurchased and may continue to repurchase common stock through private or other transactions outside of the repurchase program for additional information regarding our equity repurchases see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” and note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

business combinations 

we have completed and will continue to consider strategic business combinations to enhance our capabilities and offerings in certain areas in october 2016 we completed the merger with ims health to better serve our clients across their entire product lifecycle by i improving clinical trial design recruitment and execution ii creating realworld information solutions based on the use of medicines by actual patients in normal situations and iii increasing the efficiency of healthcare companies’ commercial organizations through enhanced analytics and outsourcing services in july 2015 we combined our global clinical trials laboratory operations in our research  development solutions segment with the clinical trials laboratory operations of quest with the resulting combined business referred to as q 2 solutions we own 60 of q 2 solutions and quest owns the remaining 40 

these transactions were accounted for as business combinations and the acquired results of operations are included in our consolidated financial information since the acquisition date with a noncontrolling interest for

sources of revenue 

total revenues are comprised of revenues from the provision of our services and revenues from reimbursed expenses that are incurred while providing our services we do not have any material product revenues our segment revenues expressed as a percent of 2016 revenues excluding reimbursed expense revenue are as follows 

 

 reimbursed expenses are comprised primarily of payments to physicians investigators who oversee clinical trials and travel expenses for our clinical monitors principally within our research  development solutions segment and travel expenses for our sales representatives within our integrated engagement services segment reimbursed expenses may fluctuate from periodtoperiod due in part to where we are in the lifecycle of the many contracts that are in progress at a particular point in time as reimbursed expenses are passthrough costs to our clients with little to no profit and we believe that the fluctuations from periodtoperiod are not meaningful to our underlying performance we do not provide any analysis of the fluctuations in these items or their impact on our financial results we have collection risk on contractually reimbursable expenses and from time to time are unable to obtain reimbursement from the client for costs incurred when such an expense is not reimbursed it is classified as costs of revenue on the consolidated statements of income 

costs and expenses 

our costs and expenses are comprised primarily of our costs of revenue reimbursed expenses and selling general and administrative expenses costs of revenue include compensation and benefits for billable employees and personnel involved in production data management and delivery and the costs of acquiring and processing data for our information offerings costs of staff directly involved with delivering technologyrelated services offerings and engagements related accommodations and the costs of data purchased specifically for technology services engagements and other expenses directly related to service contracts such as courier fees laboratory supplies professional services and travel expenses as noted above reimbursed expenses are comprised principally of payments to investigators who oversee clinical trials and travel expenses for our clinical monitors and sales representatives selling general and administrative expenses include costs related to sales marketing and administrative functions including human resources legal finance and general management for compensation and benefits travel professional services training and expenses for information technology “it” facilities and depreciation and amortization 

foreign currency translation 

in 2016 approximately 36 of our revenues were denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar because a large portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar and our financial statements are reported in united states dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly affect our results of operations the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies and translated into united states dollars for financial reporting purposes accordingly exchange rate fluctuations will affect the translation of foreign results into united states dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated results as a result we believe that providing the 

 

impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on certain financial results can facilitate the analysis of periodtoperiod comparisons of business performance that excludes the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations the constant currency information assumes the same foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect for the comparable prioryear period were used in translation of the current period results

revenues 

 

 2016 compared to 2015 

in 2016 our revenues increased 1038 million or 240 as compared to the same period in 2015 this increase was comprised of constant currency revenue growth of approximately 1044 million or 241 and a negative impact of approximately 6 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency revenue growth was comprised of a 774 million increase in commercial solutions which includes 806 million from the merger with ims health partially offset by a decline in the legacy service offerings a 336 million increase in research  development solutions which includes the incremental impact from the businesses that quest contributed to q 2 solutions and a 66 million decrease in integrated engagement services the revenue contributed by the merger in 2016 was negatively impacted by approximately 55 million as a result of adjusting the acquired ims health unearned income to fair value as required by purchase accounting 

2015 compared to 2014 

in 2015 our revenues increased 161 million or 39 as compared to 2014 this increase was comprised of constant currency revenue growth of approximately 372 million or 89 and a negative impact of approximately 211 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency revenue growth was comprised of a 98 million increase in commercial solutions which includes the impact from the encore acquisition which closed in july 2014 a 239 million increase in research  development solutions which includes the incremental impact from the businesses that quest contributed to q 2 solutions and a 35 million increase in integrated engagement services

the decrease in costs of revenue as a percent of revenues for 2015 was primarily as a result of an improvement in constant currency profit margin in the commercial solutions research  development solutions and integrated engagement services segments as more fully described in the segment discussion later in this section for 2015 this constant currency profit margin expansion was partially offset by the effect from a higher proportion of consolidated revenues being contributed by our lower margin integrated engagement services segment when compared to 2014 as well as a negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations 

selling general and administrative expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization 

 

 2016 compared to 2015

 2016 compared to 2015 

the 161 million increase in depreciation and amortization in 2016 was primarily the result of the merger with ims health

the 7 million increase in depreciation and amortization in 2015 included a constant currency increase of 11 million or 90 partially offset by a positive impact of approximately 4 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency growth was primarily due to the incremental impact from the businesses that quest contributed to q 2 solutions 

restructuring costs

interest income and interest expense 

 

 interest income included interest received primarily from bank balances and investments 

interest expense during 2016 was higher than 2015 due to an increase in the average debt outstanding primarily as a result of the debt acquired from the merger 

interest expense during 2015 reflects the increase in the average debt outstanding primarily as a result of the 275 million term loan that was issued under the receivables financing facility in december 2014 and our new senior secured credit agreement and senior notes both of which are described in liquidity and capital resources this increase was offset by a decrease in the average rate of interest incurred on our debt as compared to 2014

income tax expense 

 

 the increase in the 2016 effective income tax rate was due to a change in our permanent reinvestment assertion on the majority of our cumulative foreign earnings due to the merger we reevaluated our indefinite reinvestment assertion based on the need for cash in the united states including funding the repurchase program and potential acquisitions accordingly we changed our assertion with respect to 2801 million of foreign earnings including 1865 million of ims health’s previously undistributed historical foreign earnings we intend to use these acquired foreign earnings to fund cash needs in the united states deferred income taxes of 625 million were recorded in 2016 related to nonindefinitely reinvested foreign earnings of that amount 373 million was recorded through purchase accounting related to ims health’s historical foreign earnings and the remainder of 252 million was recorded through deferred income tax expense 

the decrease in the 2015 effective income tax rate was due to an income tax benefit related to the reversal of uncertain tax positions for tax years whose statute of limitations expired in 2015 and also a change in the relative mix of the profitability between taxing jurisdictions these benefits were partially offset by additional income tax expense related to an increase in the amount of current year earnings of our foreign subsidiaries not considered permanently reinvested 

equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates 

 

 equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates primarily included losses earnings from our investment in novaquest pharma opportunities fund iii lp “fund iii” the earnings from fund iii in 2014 were partially offset by losses and writedowns incurred on another equity method investment

 revenues 

2016 compared to 2015 

commercial solutions’ revenues were 1096 million in 2016 an increase of 773 million over 2015 which includes the incremental impact from the merger of 806 million the constant currency revenue increase was due to the incremental impact from the merger and from growth in realworld and late phase research services partially offset by lower revenues from payer provider and advisory services the revenue contributed by the merger in 2016 was negatively impacted by approximately 55 million as a result of adjusting the acquired ims health unearned income to fair value as required by purchase accounting 

2015 compared to 2014 

commercial solutions’ revenues were 323 million in 2015 an increase of 93 million or 404 over 2014 this increase was comprised of constant currency revenue growth of 98 million or 427 including 44 million from the encore acquisition which closed in july 2014 partially offset by a negative impact of approximately 5 million due to the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the increase in constant currency revenues was due to the impact from the encore acquisition which closed in july 2014 as well as growth in realworld and late phase research services partially offset by lower revenue from advisory services 

costs of revenue exclusive of depreciation and amortization 

2016 compared to 2015 

commercial solutions’ costs of revenue increased approximately 405 million in 2016 this increase was comprised of a 407 million constant currency increase which includes 438 million from the merger offset by lower costs in payer provider and advisory services due to lower revenue volumes and 2 million due to the negative effects of foreign currency fluctuations 

2015 compared to 2014 

commercial solutions’ costs of revenue increased approximately 65 million in 2015 this increase was comprised of a 71 million constant currency increase or 411 partially offset by a reduction of 6 million from the positive effects of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency increase for 2015 was due to the impact of the encore acquisition and costs to support the growth in realworld and late phase research services 

 

selling general and administrative expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization 

2016 compared to 2015 

commercial solutions’ selling general and administrative expenses increased approximately 151 million in 2016 as compared to 2015 this increase was primarily due to 158 million from the merger an increase in bad debt expense and cost reductions in various other areas

research  development solutions 

 

 backlog and net new business 

beginning with the third quarter of 2016 we began reporting net new business and backlog on an ascontracted basis signed binding commitments and signed contracts during the period we only report backlog and net new business for the research  development solutions segment on a rolling basis for the last twelve months previously net new business included nonbinding written awards which was consistent with industry practice we believe the ascontracted method is a more precise approach as it requires a higher threshold and less judgment for backlog inclusion net new business totaled 43 billion for both the 12 months ended december 31 2016 and 2015 ending backlog was 95 billion at december 31 2016 and we expect 29 billion of this backlog to convert to revenue in the next 12 months 

net new business under sole provider arrangements is recorded over the life of the arrangement as projects are awarded consistent with our methodology for calculating net new business during a particular period backlog represents at a particular point in time future service revenues from work not yet completed or performed under signed contracts once work begins on a project service revenues are recognized over the duration of the project net new business and backlog denominated in foreign currencies are valued each month using the actual average foreign exchange rates in effect during the month 

 

we believe that backlog and net new business may not be consistent indicators of future revenues because they have been and likely will be affected by a number of factors including the variable size and duration of projects many of which are performed over several years cancellations and changes to the scope of work during the course of projects projects that have been delayed remain in backlog but the timing of the revenue generated may differ from the timing originally expected additionally projects may be terminated or delayed by the customer or delayed by regulatory authorities in the event that a client cancels a contract we typically would be entitled to receive payment for all services performed up to the cancellation date and subsequent clientauthorized services related to terminating the canceled project however we typically do not have a contractual right to the full amount of the revenue reflected in our backlog or net new business contracts in the event of cancellation for more details regarding risks related to our backlog see part i item ia “risk factors—the relationship of backlog to revenues varies over time” 

revenues 

2016 compared to 2015 

research  development solutions’ revenues were 3472 million in 2016 an increase of 313 million or 99 over 2015 this increase was comprised of constant currency revenue growth of 335 million or 106 partially offset by a negative impact of approximately 22 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency revenue growth primarily included volumerelated increases in our services and the incremental impact from the businesses that quest contributed to q 2 solutions 

the volumerelated revenue growth was related to increases in revenue from both our clinical solutions and services and our clinical trial support services this growth was due largely to execution on the higher backlog in place as we entered the year the 2016 growth was negatively impacted by 17 million of nonrecurring revenue recognized in the second quarter of 2015 related to the early close out of a client arrangement the constant currency revenue growth in 2016 was negatively impacted by 27 million of foreign currency exchange rate adjustments associated with client contracts and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts

research  development solutions’ revenues were 3159 million in 2015 an increase of 109 million or 36 over 2014 this increase was comprised of constant currency revenue growth of 239 million or 78 partially offset by a negative impact of approximately 130 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency revenue growth included a volumerelated increase in our services and the incremental impact from the businesses that quest contributed to q 2 solutions 

the volumerelated revenue growth was related to an increase in revenue from both clinical solutions and services and clinical trial support services this growth was due largely to execution on the higher backlog in place as we entered the year in addition we recognized 17 million of revenue in the second quarter of 2015 as a result of the release of deferred revenue upon the early close out of a client arrangement the constant currency revenue growth in 2015 was negatively impacted by contract cancellations in 2014 as well as 28 million of foreign currency exchange rate adjustments associated with client contracts and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts 

costs of revenue exclusive of depreciation and amortization 

2016 compared to 2015 

research  development solutions’ costs of revenue increased approximately 174 million in 2016 over 2015 this increase included constant currency growth of 219 million or 123 which includes the incremental impact from the businesses that quest contributed to q2 solutions partially offset by 45 million from the positive effects of foreign currency fluctuations 

 

the constant currency costs of revenue growth was primarily due to the impact from the q 2 solutions transaction and an increase in compensation and related expenses the increase in compensation and related expenses resulted from i an increase in billable headcount resulting from the higher volume of constant currency revenue ii our continued investment in our global delivery network “gdn” which is a coordinated global delivery model that enables us to provide standardized centrallymanaged services from seven hub locations across five countries iii annual merit increases and iv an increase in competition for qualified personnel in certain markets the constant currency growth for 2016 also included a 12 million reserve for certain potentially nonreimbursable expenses these increases in cost were partially offset by 17 million of expense recognized in the second quarter of 2015 related to the early close out of a client arrangement that did not recur in 2016 and a 15 million increase in the benefit from research and development credits received in europe 

2015 compared to 2014

the constant currency costs of revenue growth was primarily due to the impact from the q 2 solutions transaction and an increase in compensation and related expenses the increase in compensation and related expenses resulted from an increase in billable headcount as a result of the ramp up of new projects as well as annual merit increases and an increase in competition for qualified personnel in certain markets also contributing to the constant currency increase was 17 million of expense recognized in the second quarter of 2015 as a result of the release of deferred contract costs upon the early close out of a client arrangement costs of revenue growth was partially offset by an 8 million increase in the benefit from research and development credits received in europe as a percent of revenues research  development solutions’ costs of revenue were 563 and 578 in 2015 and 2014 respectively the decrease in costs of revenue as a percentage of revenues reflected a favorable impact from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations and a closer alignment of resources with project requirements including cost efficiencies gained from restructuring actions taken in prior years which more than offset the impact of the constant currency costs of revenue growth noted above 

selling general and administrative expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization 

2016 compared to 2015 

research  development solutions’ selling general and administrative expenses increased approximately 21 million or 38 in 2016 as compared to 2015 this increase was caused by constant currency growth of 32 million partially offset by a reduction of 11 million from foreign currency fluctuations as a percent of revenues research  development solutions’ selling general and administrative expenses were 166 and 176 in 2016 and 2015 respectively the constant currency increase was primarily due to the incremental impact from the businesses that quest contributed to q 2 solutions higher compensation and related expenses due to annual merit increases and an increase in headcount and an increase in bad debt expense 

2015 compared to 2014 

research  development solutions’ selling general and administrative expenses increased approximately 14 million or 26 in 2015 as compared to 2014 this increase was primarily caused by a constant currency increase of 40 million which included the incremental impact from the businesses that quest contributed to q 2 solutions partially offset by a reduction of 26 million from the positive effects of foreign currency fluctuations as a percent of revenues research  development solutions’ selling general and administrative expenses were 176 and 178 in 2015 and 2014 respectively the constant currency increase was primarily due to the incremental impact from the businesses that quest contributed to q 2 solutions higher compensation and related expenses due to annual merit increases and an increase in headcount 

 

integrated engagement services 

 

 revenues 

2016 compared to 2015 

integrated engagement services’ revenues were 796 million in 2016 a decrease of 48 million or 57 over 2015 this decrease was comprised of a constant currency revenue decrease of 67 million or 79 partially offset by a positive impact of approximately 19 million due to the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the decline in constant currency revenues for 2016 was due to a decrease in commercial services in north america primarily as a result of cancellations that occurred in 2015 and earlier this year japan and europe the decline in europe was partially offset by a 10 million benefit from the acceleration of revenue due to a contract modification on a sales force arrangement that fixed a portion of the contract price that previously was not determinable until future salesbased royalties were known 

2015 compared to 2014 

integrated engagement services’ revenues were 844 million in 2015 a decrease of 41 million or 46 over 2014 this decrease was comprised of constant currency revenue growth of 35 million or 40 partially offset by a negative impact of approximately 76 million due to the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the increase in constant currency revenues was due to an increase in commercial services in north america partially offset by a decline in europe due to the loss of revenue from an agreement to distribute pharmaceutical products in italy that ended in the fourth quarter of 2014 

costs of revenue exclusive of depreciation and amortization 

2016 compared to 2015 

integrated engagement services’ costs of revenue decreased approximately 48 million in 2016 this decrease was comprised of a 60 million constant currency decrease or 87 partially offset by 11 million due to the positive effects of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency decrease for 2016 was due to a decrease in compensation and related expenses resulting from a decrease in billable headcount

needed to support the higher volume of constant currency revenue and annual merit increases these increases in compensation and related expenses were partially offset by a decline in other expenses directly related to the agreement to distribute pharmaceutical products in italy which ended in the fourth quarter of 2014 

selling general and administrative expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization 

2016 compared to 2015 

integrated engagement services’ selling general and administrative expenses increased approximately 3 million in 2016 as compared to 2015 this increase was due to a higher level of bad debt expense

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows in addition to operating cash flows other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include capital expenditures acquisitions investments debt service requirements dividends equity repurchases adequacy of our revolving credit and receivables financing facilities and access to the capital markets 

we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which those funds can be accessed on a cost effective basis the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences however those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations we have and expect to transfer cash from those subsidiaries to the united states and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so since the merger through december 31 2016 we have transferred 615 million from foreign subsidiaries to the united states 

due to the merger we reevaluated our indefinite reinvestment assertion based on the need for cash in the united states including funding the repurchase program and potential acquisitions accordingly we changed our assertion with respect to 2801 million of foreign earnings including 1865 million of ims health’s previously undistributed historical foreign earnings we intend to use these acquired foreign earnings to fund cash needs in the united states 

we had a cash balance of 1198 million at december 31 2016 237 million of which was in the united states an increase from 977 million at december 31 2015 

based on our current operating plan we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents future cash flows from operations and our ability to access funds under our revolving credit and receivables financing facilities will enable us to fund our operating requirements and capital expenditures and meet debt obligations for at least the next 12 months we regularly evaluate our debt arrangements as well as market conditions and from time to time we may explore opportunities to modify our existing debt arrangements or pursue additional financing arrangements that could result in the issuance of new debt securities by us or our affiliates for example in september 2016 ims health issued approximately 1750 million in senior notes as discussed below and we used the proceeds to repay certain outstanding indebtedness including our senior secured credit facilities following the merger we may use our existing cash cash generated from operations or dispositions of assets or businesses andor proceeds from any new financing arrangements or issuances of debt or equity 

 

securities to repay or reduce some of our outstanding obligations to repurchase shares from our stockholders or for other purposes as part of our ongoing business strategy we also continually evaluate new acquisition expansion and investment possibilities or other strategic growth opportunities as well as potential dispositions of assets or businesses as appropriate including dispositions that may cause us to recognize a loss on certain assets should we elect to pursue any such transaction we may seek to obtain debt or equity financing to facilitate those activities our ability to enter into any such potential transactions and our use of cash or proceeds is limited to varying degrees by the terms and restrictions contained in our existing debt arrangements we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to complete any such financing arrangements or other transactions on favorable terms or at all 

equity repurchases

receivables financing facility 

on december 5 2014 we entered into a fouryear arrangement to securitize certain of our accounts receivable under the receivables financing facility certain of our accounts receivable are sold on a nonrecourse basis by certain of our consolidated subsidiaries to another of our consolidated subsidiaries a bankruptcyremote 

 

special purpose entity “spe” the spe obtained a term loan and revolving loan commitment from a third party lender secured by liens on the assets of the spe to finance the purchase of the accounts receivable which included a 275 million term loan and a 25 million revolving loan commitment the revolving loan commitment may be increased by an additional 35 million as amounts are repaid under the term loan quintilesims has guaranteed the performance of the obligations of existing and future subsidiaries that sell and service the accounts receivable under the receivables financing facility the assets of the spe are not available to satisfy any of our obligations or any obligations of our subsidiaries as of december 31 2016 the full 25 million of revolving loan commitment was available under the receivables financing facility

years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 

cash flow from operating activities 

 

 2016 compared to 2015 

cash provided by operating activities increased 384 million in 2016 as compared to 2015 the increase in cash provided by operating activities reflects the increase in net income as adjusted for noncash items necessary to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities also contributing to the increase were lower payments for income taxes 15 million and lower cash used in days sales outstanding “dso” and accounts payable and accrued expenses the lower cash used in dso reflects a twoday increase in dso in 2016 compared to a sevenday increase in dso in 2015 dso can shift significantly at each reporting period depending on the timing of cash receipts under contractual payment terms relative to the recognition of revenue over a project lifecycle 

 

2015 compared to 2014 

cash provided by operating activities increased 43 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 the increase in cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects the increase in net income as adjusted for noncash items necessary to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities also contributing to the increase was an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 59 million as well as lower payments for interest 12 million and income taxes 18 million these improvements in operating cash flow were partially offset by higher cash used in dso the higher cash used in dso reflects a sevenday increase in dso in 2015 compared to a twoday increase in dso in 2014 

cash flow from investing activities 

 

 2016 compared to 2015 

cash provided by investing activities increased 1798 million in 2016 as compared 2015 this increase was primarily related to cash from the acquisition of businesses including the merger with ims health 1887 million partially offset by higher cash used for the acquisition of property equipment and software 86 million 

2015 compared to 2014 

cash used in investing activities decreased 106 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 this decrease was primarily related to cash acquired in the q 2 solutions transaction 32 million compared to cash used for the acquisition of businesses 92 million in 2014 partially offset by the termination of interest rate swaps in connection with the refinancing transaction in 2015 11 million and higher cash used for investments 

cash flow from financing activities 

 

 2016 compared to 2015 

cash used in financing activities increased 2035 million in 2016 as compared to 2015 the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily related to lower net borrowing under our credit facilities 1488 million and higher cash used to repurchase common stock 582 million 

2015 compared to 2014 

cash used in financing activities increased 119 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 the increase in cash used in financing activities in 2015 was primarily related to higher cash used to repurchase common stock 100 million and lower cash provided by debt issuances net of repayments 75 million partially offset by higher cash from stock issued under employee stock purchase and option plans 29 million and an increase in the excess income tax benefits from stockbased award activities 19 million 

 

contingencies 

we are exposed to certain known contingencies that are material to our investors the facts and circumstances surrounding these contingencies and a discussion of their effect on us are in note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k these contingencies may have a material effect on our liquidity capital resources or results of operations in addition even where our reserves are adequate the incurrence of any of these liabilities may have a material effect on our liquidity and the amount of cash available to us for other purposes 

we believe that we have made appropriate arrangements in respect of the future effect on us of these known contingencies we also believe that the amount of cash available to us from our operations together with cash from financing will be sufficient for us to pay any known contingencies as they become due without materially affecting our ability to conduct our operations and invest in the growth of our business 

contractual obligations and commitments 

below is a summary of our future payment commitments by year under contractual obligations as of december 31 2016 in millions 

 

  

     application of critical accounting policies 

note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and 

 

liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates and related disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes known actual results may differ from those estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied 1 there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement 2 the service offering has been delivered to the client 3 the collection of fees is probable and 4 the arrangement consideration is fixed or determinable we do not recognize revenue with respect to startup activities including contract and scope negotiation feasibility analysis and conflict of interest review associated with contracts the costs for these activities are expensed as incurred for contracts in which portions of revenue are contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future events we recognize the revenue only after it has been earned and the contingency has been resolved 

for arrangements that include multiple elements arrangement consideration is allocated to units of accounting based on the relative selling price the best evidence of selling price of a unit of accounting is vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” which is the price we charge when the deliverable is sold separately when vsoe is not available to determine selling price we use relevant thirdparty evidence “tpe” of selling price if available when neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists we use our best estimate of selling price considering all relevant information that is available without undue cost and effort 

we derive the majority of our revenues in the commercial solutions segment from various information and technology service offerings our revenue arrangements may include multiple elements a typical information offerings arrangement primarily under fixedprice contracts may include an ongoing subscriptionbased deliverable for which revenue is recognized ratably as earned over the contract period andor a onetime delivery of data offerings for which revenue is recognized upon delivery assuming all other criteria are met our subscription arrangements typically have terms ranging from one to three years and are generally noncancelable and do not contain refundtype provisions we also offer technology services offerings that enable our clients to make informed business decisions technology services offerings consist of a mix of small and largescale services and consulting projects multiyear outsourcing contracts and saas licenses these arrangements typically have terms ranging from several weeks to three years with a majority having terms of one year or less revenues for services engagements where deliverables occur ratably over time are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the arrangement revenues from time and material contracts are recognized as the services are provided revenues from fixed price ad hoc services and consulting contracts are recognized either over the contract term based on the ratio of the number of hours incurred for services provided during the period compared to the total estimated hours to be incurred over the entire arrangement efforts based or upon delivery completed contract 

the majority of revenue in our research  development solutions segment and integrated engagement services segment is recognized based on objective contractual criteria and does not require significant estimates or judgments however at any point in time we are working on thousands of active client projects which are governed by individual contracts most projects are customized based on the needs of the client the type of services being provided therapeutic indication of the drug geographic locations and other variables project specific terms related to pricing billing terms and the scope and type of services to be provided are generally negotiated and contracted on a projectbyproject basis changes in the scope of work are common especially under longterm contracts and generally result in a change in contract value in such situations we enter into 

 

negotiations for a contract amendment to reflect the change in scope and the related price depending on the complexity of the amendment the negotiation process can take from a few weeks for a simple adjustment to several months for a complex amendment management may authorize the project team to commence work on activities outside the contract scope while we negotiate and finalize the contract amendment in these limited cases if we are not able to obtain a contract amendment from the client our profit margin on the arrangement may be impacted this result occurs because our costs of delivery are expensed as they are incurred while revenue is not recognized unless the client has agreed to the changes in scope and renegotiated pricing terms the contract value is amended and all other revenue recognition criteria are met most contracts are terminable upon 30 to 90 days notice by the client our risk of material loss in these situations is mitigated as these contracts generally require payment to us for expenses to wind down the clinical trial or project fees earned to date and in some cases a termination fee or a payment of some portion of the fees or profits that could have been earned under the contract if it had not been terminated early in addition our contract terms provide for payment terms that generally correspond with performance of the services termination fees are included in revenues when realization is assured 

accounts receivable and unbilled services 

accounts receivable represents amounts billed to clients revenues recognized in excess of billings are classified as unbilled services the realization of these amounts is based on the client’s willingness and ability to pay us we have an allowance for doubtful accounts based on management’s estimate of probable losses we expect to incur resulting from a client failing to pay us our allowance for doubtful accounts and losses from clients failing to pay us have not been material to our results of operations if any of these estimates change or actual results differs from expected results then an adjustment is recorded in the period in which the amounts become reasonably estimable these adjustments could have a material effect on our results of operations 

investments in unconsolidated affiliates—equity method investments 

we have investments in unconsolidated affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting periodically we review our investments for a decline in value which we believe may be other than temporary should we identify such a decline we will record a loss through earnings to establish a new cost basis for the investment these losses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

income taxes 

certain items of income and expense are not recognized on our income tax returns and financial statements in the same year which creates timing differences the income tax effect of these timing differences results in 1 deferred income tax assets that create a reduction in future income taxes and 2 deferred income tax liabilities that create an increase in future income taxes recognition of deferred income tax assets is based on management’s belief that it is more likely than not that the income tax benefit associated with certain temporary differences income tax operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and income tax credits would be realized we recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets for those deferred income tax items for which it was more likely than not that realization would not occur we determined the amount of the valuation allowance based in part on our assessment of future taxable income and in light of our ongoing income tax strategies if our estimate of future taxable income or tax strategies changes at any time in the future we would record an adjustment to our valuation allowance recording such an adjustment could have a material effect on our financial position 

income tax expense is based on the distribution of profit before income tax among the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate adjusted as required by the income tax laws of each taxing jurisdiction changes in the distribution of profits and losses among taxing jurisdictions may have a significant impact on our effective income tax rate we do not consider the undistributed earnings of most of our foreign subsidiaries to be 

 

indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states accordingly we have provided a deferred income tax liability related to those undistributed earnings the associated foreign income taxes on our foreign earnings could be available as a credit in the united states on our income taxes we recognize foreign tax credits to the extent that the recognition is supported by projected foreign source income 

business combinations 

we use the acquisition method to account for business combinations and accordingly the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recorded at their estimated fair values on the date of the acquisition we use significant judgments estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest including expected future cash flows discount rates that reflect the risk associated with the expected future cash flows and estimated useful lives 

when a business combination involves contingent consideration we recognize a liability equal to the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the date of the acquisition the estimate of fair value of a contingent consideration liability requires subjective assumptions to be made regarding future business results including revenues and net new business discount rates that reflect the risk associated with the expected future cash flows and probabilities assigned to various potential business result scenarios we reassess the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration each financial reporting period over the term of the arrangement any resulting changes are recognized in earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations 

goodwill tangible and identifiable intangible assets 

we have recorded and allocated to our reporting units the excess of the cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired known as goodwill the recoverability of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated annually for impairment or if and when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment we review the carrying values of other identifiable intangible assets if the facts and circumstances indicate a possible impairment goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized and other identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives we believe that the risk of an impairment to goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets is currently very low 

for goodwill we perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its book value this includes a qualitative analysis of macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations internal cost factors financial performance fair value history and other company specific events if this qualitative analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that estimated fair value is less than the book value for the respective reporting unit we apply a twostep impairment test in which we determine whether the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of its carrying value if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied estimated fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill we determine the implied estimated fair value of goodwill by determining the present value of the estimated future cash flows for each reporting unit and comparing the reporting unit’s risk profile and growth prospects to selected reasonably similar publicly traded companies the inherent subjectivity of applying a discounted cash flow and market comparables approach to valuing our assets and liabilities could have a significant impact on our analysis any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

for indefinitelived intangible assets we perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value if this qualitative analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset we determine the estimated fair value of the indefinite

 

lived intangible asset trade name by determining the present value of the estimated royalty payments on an aftertax basis that it would be required to pay the owner for the right to use such trade name if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we review the carrying values of property and equipment if the facts and circumstances suggest that a potential impairment may have occurred if this review indicates that carrying values will not be recoverable as determined based on undiscounted cash flows over the remaining depreciation or amortization period we will reduce carrying values to estimated fair value the inherent subjectivity of our estimates of future cash flows could have a significant impact on our analysis any future writeoffs of longlived assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

stockbased compensation 

we measure compensation cost for most stockbased payment awards stock options and stock appreciation rights granted to employees and nonemployee directors at fair value using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model stockbased compensation expense includes stockbased awards granted to employees and nonemployee directors and has been reported in selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income based upon the classification of the individuals who were granted stockbased awards 

the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions including share price volatility the expected life of the award riskfree interest rate and the fair value of the underlying common shares on the date of grant in developing our assumptions we take into account the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 pensions and other postretirement benefits 

we provide retirement benefits to certain employees including defined benefit pension plans and postretirement medical plans the determination of benefit obligations and expense is based on actuarial models in order to measure benefit costs and obligations using these models critical assumptions are made with regard to the discount rate expected return on plan assets cash balance crediting rate lump sum conversion rate and the assumed rate of compensation increases in addition retiree medical care cost trend rates are a key assumption used exclusively in determining costs for our postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans management reviews these critical assumptions at least annually other assumptions involve demographic factors such as the turnover retirement and mortality rates management reviews these assumptions periodically and updates them when its experience deems it appropriate to do so 

the discount rate is the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled and is determined annually by management for united states plans the discount rate is based on results of a modeling process in 

 

which the plans’ expected cash flow determined on a projected benefit obligation basis is matched with spot rates developed from a yield curve comprised of highgrade moody’s aa and above or standard and poor’s aa and above noncallable corporate bonds to develop the present value of the expected cash flow and then determining the single rate discount rate which when applied to the expected cash flow derives that same present value in the united kingdom specifically the discount rate is set based on the yields on a universe of high quality noncallable corporate bonds denominated in the british pound appropriate to the duration of plan liabilities for the other nonunited states plans the discount rate is based on the current yield of an index of high quality corporate bonds as a sensitivity measure a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate for either our united states plan or our united kingdom plans absent any offsetting changes in other assumptions would result in less than 1 million increase in pension expense within the consolidated statements of income 

under the united states qualified retirement plan participants have a notional retirement account that increases with pay and investment credits the rate used to determine the investment credit cash balance crediting rate varies monthly at retirement the account is converted to a monthly retirement benefit 

in selecting an expected return on plan asset assumption we consider the returns being earned by each plan investment category in the fund the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment and longterm economic forecasts for the type of investments held by the plan the actual return on plan assets will vary from year to year versus this assumption we believe it is appropriate to use longterm expected forecasts in selecting the expected return on plan assets as such there can be no assurance that our actual return on plan assets will approximate the longterm expected forecasts as a sensitivity measure a 25 basis point change in the expected return on assets “eroa” assumption for our united states plan absent any offsetting changes in other assumptions would result in a less than 1 million increase or decrease in pension expense for our united kingdom plans a 25 basis point change in the eroa assumption absent any offsetting changes in other assumptions would result in a less than 1 million increase or decrease in pension expense while we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our pension and postretirement obligations and future expense 

we utilize a corridor approach to amortizing unrecognized gains and losses in the pension and postretirement plans amortization occurs when the accumulated unrecognized net gain or loss balance exceeds the criterion of 10 of the larger of the beginning balances of the projected benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of the plan assets the excess unrecognized gain or loss balance is then amortized using the straightline method over the average remaining servicelife of active employees expected to receive benefits at december 31 2016 the weightedaverage remaining servicelife of active employees was approximately 13 years 

foreign currency 

we have significant investments in nonunited states countries therefore changes in the value of foreign currencies affect our consolidated financial statements when translated into united states dollars for all operations outside the united states where we have designated the local currency as the functional currency assets and liabilities are translated using endofperiod exchange rates revenues expenses and cash flows are translated using average rates of exchange prevailing during the period the transactions occurred translation gains and losses are included as an adjustment to the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders’ deficit in addition gains and losses from foreign currency transactions such as those resulting from the settlement and revaluation of thirdparty and intercompany foreign receivables and payables are included in the determination of net income loss 

for operations in countries that are considered to be highly inflationary or where the united states dollar is designated as the functional currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured using endofperiod exchange rates whereas nonmonetary accounts are remeasured using historical exchange rates and all remeasurement and transaction adjustments are recognized in other expense income net 

 

recently issued accounting standards 

information relating to recently issued accounting standards is included in note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to various market risks and we regularly evaluate our exposure to such changes our overall risk management strategy seeks to balance the magnitude of the exposure and the cost and availability of appropriate financial instruments the following analyses present the sensitivity of our financial instruments to hypothetical changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period 

foreign currency exchange rates 

we transact business in more than 100 countries and are subject to risks associated with fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates our objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency exchange rate movements accordingly we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the impact of foreign exchange movements on non–functional currency assets and liabilities we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency cash flows related to service contracts and to hedge nonunited states dollar anticipated intercompany royalties it is our policy to enter into foreign currency transactions only to the extent necessary to meet its objectives as stated above we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for investment or speculative purposes the principal currencies hedged are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the swiss franc and the canadian dollar 

the contractual value of our foreign exchange derivative instruments all of which were foreign exchange forward contracts was approximately 489 million at december 31 2016 the fair value of these contracts is subject to change as a result of potential changes in foreign exchange rates we assess our market risk based on changes in foreign exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in fair values based on a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates the potential loss in fair value for foreign exchange forward contracts based on a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the united states dollar or in the case of nondollarrelated contracts the currency being purchased was 39 million at december 31 2016 however the change in the fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts would likely be offset by a change in the fair value of the future service contract revenue royalty or balance sheet exposure being hedged the estimated fair values of the foreign exchange forward contracts were determined based on quoted market prices 

exchange rate fluctuations affect the united states dollar value of foreign currency revenue and expenses and may have a significant effect on our results excluding the impacts from any outstanding or future hedging transactions a hypothetical 10 change in average exchange rates used to translate all foreign currencies to the united states dollar would have impacted income before income taxes for 2016 by approximately 65 million the actual impact of exchange rate movements in the future could differ materially from this hypothetical analysis based on the mix of foreign currencies and the timing and magnitude of individual exchange rate movements 

additionally commencing in 2016 we designated a portion of our foreign currency denominated debt as a hedge of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries to reduce the volatility in stockholders’ equity caused by changes in the euro exchange rate with respect to the united states dollar as of december 31 2016 these borrowings net of original issue discount were €2025 million 2131 million a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the united states dollar would lead to a potential loss in fair value of 213 million however this change in fair value would be offset by the change in fair value of the hedged portion of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries 

 

interest rates 

because we have variable rate debt fluctuations in interest rates affect our business we attempt to minimize interest rate risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate caps and swaps we have entered into interest rate caps and swaps with financial institutions that have reset dates and critical terms that match the underlying debt accordingly any change in market value associated with the interest rate caps and swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt as of december 31 2016 we had approximately 44 billion of variable rate indebtedness and interest rate caps and swaps with a notional value of 19 billion because we do not attempt to hedge all of our variable rate debt we may incur higher interest costs for the portion of our variable rate debt which is not hedged each quarterpoint increase or decrease in the variable interest rate would result in our interest expense changing by approximately 6 million per year under our unhedged variable rate debt 

marketable securities 

at december 31 2016 we held investments in marketable equity securities these investments are classified as either trading securities or availableforsale securities and are recorded at fair value in the financial statements these securities are subject to price risk as of december 31 2016 the fair value of these investments was 40 million based on the quoted market value of the securities the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease of 10 in quoted market values was approximately 4 million at december 31 2016

 item 1 business

company overview

we are the world’s largest provider of biopharmaceutical development services and commercial outsourcing services we are positioned at the intersection of business services and healthcare and generated 43 billion of service revenues in 2015 conduct business in approximately 100 countries and have approximately 36100 employees we use the breadth and depth of our service offerings our global footprint and our therapeutic scientific and analytics expertise to help our biopharmaceutical customers as well as other healthcare customers to be more successful in an increasingly complex healthcare environment

we were founded in 1982 by dennis b gillings cbe phd who was a biostatistics professor at the university of north carolina at chapel hill dr gillings and his cofounder pioneered the use of sophisticated statistical algorithms to improve the quality of data used to determine the efficacy of various drug therapies we expanded internationally into europe in 1987 and into asia in 1993 in 1994 we completed an initial public offering or ipo and in 2003 we exited the public markets through a going private transaction in may 2013 we returned to the public markets by completing an ipo on the new york stock exchange or nyse

we are a leader in the development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical therapies our product development segment is the world’s largest contract research organization or cro based upon the most recently available public information of reported service revenues and is focused primarily on phase iiiv clinical trials and associated laboratory and analytical activities our integrated healthcare services segment includes one of the leading global commercial pharmaceutical sales and service organizations in addition to healthcare business services for the broader healthcare sector such as real world and late phase research market access and consulting health information analytics and technology consulting and other healthcare solutions product development contributed approximately 74 and integrated healthcare services contributed approximately 26 to our 2015 service revenues additional information regarding our segments is presented in note 20 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

our global scale and capabilities enable us to work with the leading companies in the biopharmaceutical sector during each of the last 13 years we have worked with the 20 largest biopharmaceutical companies ranked by 2014 reported revenues we have provided services in connection with the development or commercialization of 98 of the top 100 bestselling biopharmaceutical products and the top 50 bestselling biologic products from 2014 as measured by reported sales

in 2015 our service revenues were 43 billion and our net income attributable to our shareholders was 3872 million in addition our 2015 net new business was 53 billion and we ended the year with 120 billion in backlog our backlog at december 31 2015 was diversified with 28 from top 10 biopharmaceutical companies 23 with biopharmaceutical companies ranked as 1120 24 with biopharmaceutical companies ranked as 2150 and 25 with biopharmaceutical companies outside the top 50 in each case as ranked by 2014 sales see part i item 1 “business—net new business reporting and backlog” for more detail during each of the last eight years we have had at least eight customers from whom we earned more than 100 million in service revenues no single customer represented more than 10 of our 2015 revenues

our markets

the market served by product development consists primarily of biopharmaceutical companies including medical device and diagnostics companies that outsource services associated with the development of pharmaceutical products such as clinical trials we estimate that total research and development spending was approximately 143 billion in 2015 of which biopharmaceutical spending on drug development was approximately 97 billion and we estimate that our addressable market clinical development spending excluding preclinical spending was approximately 54 billion the portion of this 54 billion that was outsourced in 2015 based on our estimates was approximately 22 billion we estimate based on industry data analysis and our own estimates that the potential market for product development’s services should experience a compound annual growth rate or cagr of 68 from 2015 through 2018 as a result of the increased outsourcing of research and development spending by biopharmaceutical companies in addition to increases over time in this overall spending as compared to 2014

 

integrated healthcare services primarily addresses markets related to the use of approved biopharmaceutical products we estimate that total spending related to approve d drugs including biopharmaceutical spending on commercialization of these drugs and expenditures by participants in the broader healthcare market on realworld research healthcare technology implementation analytics and evidencebased medicine exceede d 101 billion in 2015 integrated healthcare services links product development to healthcare delivery this segment’s services include commercial services such as recruiting training deploying and managing a global sales force channel management pati ent engagement services market access consulting brand communication advisory services and health information analytics and technology consulting in addition integrated healthcare services offers realworld late phase services such as observational s tudies comparative effectiveness studies and product and disease registry services which are intended to help increase the quality and costeffectiveness of healthcare and payer provider solutions we believe that a combination of cost pressure in health care systems around the world and the increasing focus on the value and efficacy of pharmaceutical therapy provide us many opportunities to grow our revenues and expand our service offerings by improving the costeffectiveness of drug therapies 

we believe that we are wellpositioned to benefit from current trends in the biopharmaceutical and healthcare industries that affect our markets including

trends in research and development spending we estimate that research and development spending was approximately 143 billion in 2015 and will grow to approximately 155 billion in 2018 with drug development accounting for approximately 68 of total expenditures research and development spending trends are impacted as a result of several factors including major biopharmaceutical companies’ efforts to replenish revenues lost from the socalled “patent cliff” of recent years increased access to capital by the small and midcap biotechnology industry and recent increases in pharmaceutical approvals by regulatory authorities in 2015 there were approximately 5084 drugs in the phase iiii development pipeline an increase of 36 since 2010 and there were 45 new molecular entities approvals by the united states food and drug administration or fda which was the highest number of approvals in any of the past 19 years we believe that further research and development spending combined with the continued need for cost efficiency across the healthcare landscape will continue to create opportunities for biopharmaceutical services companies particularly those with a global reach and broad service offerings to help biopharmaceutical companies with their pre and postlaunch product development and commercialization needs 

growth in outsourcing we estimate that clinical development spending outsourced to cros in phases iiv in 2015 was approximately 22 billion and will grow to approximately 28 billion by 2018 we expect outsourced clinical development to cros to grow 68 annually during this period and believe this annual growth will be driven largely by increased outsourcing penetration with up to 2 of this growth coming from increased research and development expenditures over 2015 to 2018 in estimating these growth rates we monitor the ability of biopharmaceutical companies including biotechnology companies to raise capital as well as the potential impact from merger and acquisition activity between biopharmaceutical companies we estimate that overall outsourcing penetration of the addressable market in 2015 was 41 the market served by integrated healthcare services is diverse which makes it difficult to estimate the current amount of outsourced integrated healthcare services and the expected growth in such services however based on our knowledge of these markets we believe that while the rate of outsourcing penetration varies by market within integrated healthcare services the current outsourcing penetration of the estimated 101 billion market is approximately 23 as business models continue to evolve in the healthcare sector we believe that the growth rate for outsourcing across the integrated healthcare services markets will be similar to the growth in clinical development 

we believe that we are well positioned for the future evolution of the healthcare sector as increasing demand from governments and other payers around the world for quality accountability and value for money drive biopharmaceutical companies providers and other healthcare organizations to transform their value chain away from a vertically integrated model to one that is more focused on their core competencies in particular we believe that the following trends will result in increased outsourcing to global biopharmaceutical services companies

we utilize our global integrated health service platform together with our scientific and clinical expertise to offer a range of specialized services to organizations and users across the care continuum including governments hospitals physician offices and pharmacies these services include comparative and costeffectiveness research capabilities clinical management analytics decision support services medication adherence and health outcome optimization services and webbased systems for measuring quality improvement our july 2014 acquisition of encore health resources or encore enhanced our ehr expertise which is becoming increasingly important as biopharmaceutical customers payers and providers focus on measuring outcomes based on realworld performance in terms of clinical effectiveness and value

our customers and marketing

we take a holistic customeroriented view toward business development our integrated business development group is responsible for assessing our customers’ current and future needs and helping to define the right service offerings to be delivered at the right time we conduct business development efforts across our service offerings and within many individual service offerings and in order to foster accountability in key service offering areas each offering area has a designated leader who drives the financial contribution for that offering area this management structure directs the selling and business development personnel in each of our major locations in the united states and throughout europe asia japan canada and latin america providing coverage to both multinational and regionaldomestic biopharmaceutical companies we maintain dedicated customer teams that deliver customized solutions from the full breadth and depth of our service offerings for the world’s leading biopharmaceutical companies and continue to evolve our relationships with our midsize small and other biopharmaceutical customers outside the 20 largest biopharmaceutical companies based on 2014 reported revenues

 

in 2015 we earned service revenues of over 100 million each in six countries in north america europe and asia please refer to note 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further detai ls regarding our foreign and domestic operations in 2015 2014 and 2013 for a discussion of risks attendant to our foreign operations see “risk factors—our business is subject to international economic political and other risks that could negatively aff ect our results of operations and financial condition” 

our service revenues were attributed to our segments as follows

 



additional information regarding our segments is presented in note 20 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated service revenues in 2015 2014 or 2013 in the past we have derived and may in the future derive a significant portion of our service revenues from a relatively limited number of major projects or customers as biopharmaceutical companies continue to outsource large projects andor functions to fewer providers this concentration of business could increase

our competition

the market for our product development services is highly competitive and we compete against traditional cros the inhouse research and development departments of biopharmaceutical companies universities and teaching hospitals among the traditional cros there are severalhundred small limitedservice providers several mediumsized firms and only a few fullservice companies with global capabilities consolidation among cros likely will result in greater competition among the larger cros for customers clinical personnel and acquisition candidates product development’s primary competitors include pharmaceutical product development inc parexel international corporation icon plc inventiv health inc or inventiv inc research pra international and covance inc the drug development business of laboratory corporation of america holdings or labcorp among others competitive factors for product development services include





























 

integrated healthcare services competes in the postapproval and commercialization arenas in the postapproval arena our solutions compete against realworld and late phase research providers including boutique firms divisions of biopharmaceutical compa nies and divisions of traditional cro’s noted above our commercial solutions compete against the inhouse sales and marketing departments of biopharmaceutical companies other contract pharmaceutical sales and service organizations and consulting firms integrated healthcare services’ primary commercial competitors in the united states include inventiv pdi inc which sold its commercial services business to publicis healthcare communications group during the fourth quarter of 2015 and publicis sellin g solutions outside of the united states integrated healthcare services commercial teams typically compete against single country or more regionally focused commercial service providers such as united drug plc inventiv eps corporation and cmic holding s co ltd in japan the primary competitive factors affecting integrated healthcare services are breadth of service offering and ability to deploy in an integrated manner quality and track record ie the proven ability to quickly assemble train and ma nage large qualified commercial teams on a global footprint and price 

notwithstanding these competitive factors we believe that the synergies arising from integrating product development services with commercial services supported by therapeutic and scientific expertise global operations data analysis and the ability to form long term strategic alliances with biopharmaceutical companies differentiate us from our competitors

government regulation

many aspects of our businesses are regulated by federal and state laws rules and regulations accordingly we maintain a comprehensive compliance program and we believe we operate our business in substantial compliance with all existing legal requirements material to the operation of our businesses there are however significant uncertainties involving the application of various legal requirements the violation of which could result in among other things sanctions see “part i — item 1a — risk factors” for additional detail

good clinical practice

gcp regulations and guidelines contain the industry standards for the conduct of clinical trials with respect to the integrity of the data and safety of the research subjects the fda the european medicines agency or ema japan’s ministry of health labour and welfare and many other regulatory authorities require that study results and data submitted to such authorities be based on clinical trials conducted in accordance with gcp provisions records for clinical trials must be maintained for specified periods for inspection by the fda and other regulators significant noncompliance with gcp requirements can result in the disqualification by regulators of data collected during the clinical trial

our standard operating procedures related to clinical trials are written in accordance with regulations and guidelines appropriate to the region where they are used thus helping to ensure compliance with gcp fda regulations and guidelines serve as a basis for our north american standard operating procedures within europe we perform our work subject to the ema’s note for guidance “good clinical practice for trials on medicinal products in the european community” all clinical trials other than those defined as noninterventional to be submitted to the ema must meet the requirements of the ich’s gcp standards our offices in asia and in latin america have developed standard operating procedures in accordance with their local requirements and in harmony with our north american and european operations

regulation of drugs biologics and medical devices

in the united states pharmaceutical biological and medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by the fda the federal food drug and cosmetic act or the fdc act the public health service act or the phs act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern among other things the research development testing manufacture storage recordkeeping approval labeling promotion and marketing distribution postapproval monitoring and reporting sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical biological and medical device products failure to comply with applicable united states requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions such as fda refusal to approve a pending nda for a new drug a bla for a new biological product or pma or clearance for a new medical device warning or untitled letters product recalls product seizures total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions fines civil penalties and criminal prosecution

before a new drug or biologic may be marketed it must undergo extensive testing and regulatory review to determine that it is safe and effective and be approved by the fda or other regulatory authority even after approval a new pma or pma supplement may be required in the event of a modification to the device its labeling or its manufacturing process

 

regulation of patient information 

our information management services relate to the diagnosis and treatment of disease and are therefore subject to substantial governmental regulation in addition the confidentiality of patientspecific information and the circumstances under which such patientspecific records may be released for inclusion in our databases or used in other aspects of our business is heavily regulated federal state and foreign governments are contemplating or have proposed or adopted additional legislation governing the possession use and dissemination of personal data such as personal health information and personal financial data as well as security breach notification rules for loss or theft of such data additional legislation or regulation of this type might among other things require us to implement new security measures and processes or bring within the legislation or regulation deidentified health or other personal data each of which may require substantial expenditures or limit our ability to offer some of our services

in particular personal healthrelated information is recognized in many countries such as the united states the european union or eu and several countries in asia as a special sensitive category of personal information subject to additional mandatory protections violations of data protection regulations are subject to administrative penalties civil money penalties and criminal prosecution including corporate fines and personal liability

in order to comply with these evolving laws and regulations we may need to implement new data protection privacy and data security measures which may require us to make substantial expenditures or cause us to discontinue or limit the products and services we offer in addition if we violate applicable laws regulations contractual commitments or other duties relating to the use privacy or security of health information we could be subject to regulatory sanctions civil liability or criminal prosecution or suffer reputational harm and it may be necessary to modify our business practices

regulation of promotion marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products and medical devices

our integrated healthcare services are subject to detailed and comprehensive regulation in each geographic market in which we operate such regulation relates among other things to the distribution of drug samples the marketing and promotion of approved products the qualifications of sales representatives and the use of healthcare professionals in sales functions

in the united states our integrated healthcare services are subject to numerous federal and state laws pertaining to promotional activities involving pharmaceutical products and medical devices such as the fda’s regulations against “offlabel promotion” which require sales representatives to restrict promotion of the approved product they are detailing to the approved labeling for the product and the prescription drug marketing act which imposes licensing personnel record keeping packaging labeling product handling and facility storage and security requirements other federal and state laws prohibit manufacturers suppliers and providers from offering giving or receiving kickbacks or other remuneration in connection with ordering or recommending the purchase or rental of healthcare items and services the sale or distribution of pharmaceutical products and devices is also governed by the united states federal trade commission act and state consumer protection laws we are subject to similar regulations currently in effect in the other countries where we offer integrated healthcare services

we are also subject to various laws and regulations that may apply to certain drug and device promotional practices including among others various aspects of the medicare program violations of these laws and regulations may result in criminal andor civil penalties including possibly as an “aider and abettor”

regulation of laboratories

our united states laboratories are subject to licensing and regulation under federal state and local laws relating to hazard communication and employee righttoknow regulations and the safety and health of laboratory employees additionally our united states laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations and licensing requirements relating to the handling storage and disposal of hazardous waste radioactive materials and laboratory specimens including the regulations of the environmental protection agency the nuclear regulatory commission the department of transportation the national fire protection agency and the united states drug enforcement administration or dea the use of controlled substances in testing for drugs with a potential for abuse is regulated in the united states by the dea and by similar regulatory bodies in other parts of the world our united states laboratories using controlled substances for testing purposes are licensed by the dea the regulations of the united states department of transportation public health service and postal service apply to the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens our laboratories also are subject to international air transport association regulations which govern international shipments of laboratory specimens furthermore when the materials are sent to a foreign country the transportation of such materials becomes subject to the laws rules and regulations of such foreign country our laboratories outside the united states are subject to applicable national laws governing matters such as licensing the handling and disposal of medical specimens hazardous waste and radioactive materials as well as the health and safety of laboratory employees

 

in addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace the united states occupational safety and health administration has est ablished extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers may be exposed to bloodborne pathogens such as hiv and the hepatitis b virus although we believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respe cts with such federal state and local laws failure to comply with such laws could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business fines criminal penalties and other enforcement actions 

further laboratories that analyze human blood or other biological samples for the diagnosis and treatment of clinical trial subjects must comply with clia as well as requirements established by various states the failure to meet these requirements may result in civil penalties and suspension or revocation of the clia certification

our intellectual property

we develop and use a number of proprietary methodologies analytics systems technologies and other intellectual property in the conduct of our business we rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies nondisclosure agreements invention assignments and other contractual arrangements to protect our trade secrets and patent copyright and trademark laws to protect other intellectual property rights we have also registered or applied for trademarks and service marks in the united states and a number of foreign countries and our trademark “quintiles ® ” is of material importance to us although the duration of trademark and service mark registrations varies from country to country trademarks and service marks generally may be renewed indefinitely so long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained and so long as they have not been found to have become generic although we believe the ownership of our patents trademarks and service marks is an important factor in our business and that our success does depend in part on the ownership thereof we rely primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of our employees other than our quintiles ® trademark we do not have any material patents trademarks service marks licenses franchises or concessions

net new business reporting and backlog

net new business is the value of services awarded during the period from projects under signed contracts letters of intent and in some cases precontract commitments which are supported by written communications and adjusted for contracts that were modified or canceled during the period net new business under sole provider arrangements is recorded over the life of the arrangement as projects are awarded consistent with our methodology for calculating net new business during a particular period backlog represents at a particular point in time future service revenues from work not yet completed or performed under signed contracts letters of intent and in some cases precontract commitments that are supported by written communications once work begins on a project service revenues are recognized over the duration of the project historically net new business and backlog denominated in foreign currencies were valued each month throughout the year using foreign exchange rates that were in effect at the beginning of each fiscal year beginning with the first quarter of 2015 net new business and backlog denominated in foreign currencies are valued each month using the actual average foreign exchange rates in effect during the month the application of this new approach to value foreign currency denominated net new business and backlog would not have had a significant impact to any prior period’s reported amounts therefore historical amounts have not been restated to reflect this change in methodology included within backlog at december 31 2015 is approximately 8188 million of backlog that we do not expect to generate revenue in the next 12 months

backlog was as follows

 



net new business was as follows

 



 

we believe that backlog and net new business may not be consistent indicators of future revenues because they have been and likely will be affected by a number of factors including the variable size and duration of projects many of which are performed over several years cancellations and changes to the scope of work during the course of projects projects that have been delayed remain in backlog but the timing of the revenue generated may differ from the timing originally expected additionally pro jects may be terminated or delayed by the customer or delayed by regulatory authorities in the event that a customer cancels a contract we typically would be entitled to receive payment for all services performed up to the cancellation date and subsequen t customerauthorized services related to terminating the canceled project however we typically do not have a contractual right to the full amount of the revenue reflected in our backlog or net new business contracts in the event of cancellation for mor e details regarding risks related to our backlog see “risk factors—the relationship of backlog to revenues varies over time” 

employees

as of december 31 2015 we had approximately 36100 fulltime equivalent employees in approximately 60 countries comprised approximately of 12800 in the americas region 10900 in the europe and africa region and 12400 in the asiapacific region with at least 500 employees in more than 10 countries around the world as of december 31 2015 product development and integrated healthcare services had approximately 24800 and 9500 fulltime equivalent employees respectively in addition our centralized operationscorporate office had approximately 1800 fulltime equivalent employees

the success of our business depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified professional scientific and technical staff the level of competition among employers in the united states and overseas for skilled personnel particularly those with phd md or equivalent degrees or training is high we believe that our brand recognition and our multinational presence are an advantage in attracting qualified candidates in addition we believe that the wide range of clinical trials in which we participate allows us to offer broad experience to clinical researchers none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union employees in some of our nonunited states locations are represented by works councils as required by local laws we believe that our relations with our employees are good

 item 1a ri sk factors 

risk factors

we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks some of which are beyond our control you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below together with the other information included in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating our company the occurrence of any of the following risks may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects

risks relating to our business

the potential loss or delay of our large contracts or of multiple contracts could adversely affect our results

most of our customers can terminate our contracts upon 30 to 90 days notice our customers may delay terminate or reduce the scope of our contracts for a variety of reasons beyond our control including but not limited to























as a result contract terminations delays and alterations are a regular part of our business in the event of termination our contracts often provide for fees for winding down the project but these fees may not be sufficient for us to maintain our margins and termination may result in lower resource utilization rates in addition we may not realize the full benefits of our backlog of contractually committed services if our customers cancel delay or reduce their commitments under our contracts with them which may occur if among other things a customer decides to shift its business to a competitor or revoke our status as a preferred provider thus the loss or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could adversely affect our service revenues and profitability we believe the risk of loss or delay of multiple contracts potentially has greater effect where we are party to broader partnering arrangements with global biopharmaceutical companies

our financial results may be adversely affected if we underprice our contracts overrun our cost estimates or fail to receive approval for or experience delays in documenting change orders

most of our contracts are either fee for service contracts or fixedfee contracts our past financial results have been and our future financial results may be adversely impacted if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates and are unable to successfully negotiate a change order change orders typically occur when the scope of work we perform needs to be modified from that originally contemplated by our contract with the customer modifications can occur for example when there is a change in a key clinical trial assumption or parameter or a significant change in timing where we are not successful in converting outofscope work into change orders under our current contracts we bear the cost of the additional work such underpricing significant cost overruns or delay in documentation of change orders could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows

 

the relationship of backlog to revenues varies over time 

backlog represents future service revenues from work not yet completed or performed under signed contracts letters of intent and in some cases written precontract commitments once work begins on a project revenue is recognized over the duration of the project projects may be terminated or delayed by the customer or delayed by regulatory authorities for reasons beyond our control to the extent projects are delayed the timing of our revenue could be affected in the event that a customer cancels a contract we typically would be entitled to receive payment for all services performed up to the cancellation date and subsequent customerauthorized services related to terminating the canceled project typically however we have no contractual right to the full amount of the revenue reflected in our backlog in the event of a contract cancellation the duration of the projects included in our backlog and the related revenue recognition range from a few weeks to many years our backlog may not be indicative of our future revenues and we may not realize all the anticipated future revenue reflected in our backlog a number of factors may affect backlog including







our backlog at december 31 2015 was 12038 million compared to backlog of 11244 million at december 31 2014 although an increase in backlog will generally result in an increase in revenues to be recognized over time depending on the level of cancellations an increase in backlog at a particular point in time does not necessarily correspond directly to an increase in revenues during a particular period the extent to which contracts in backlog will result in revenue depends on many factors including but not limited to delivery against projected schedules the need for scope changes change orders contract cancellations and the nature duration size complexity and phase of the contracts each of which factors can vary significantly from time to time our 12038 million of backlog at december 31 2015 included approximately 8188 million of backlog that we do not expect to generate revenue in 2016 as compared to our 11244 million of backlog at december 31 2014 which included approximately 7593 million of backlog that we did not expect to generate revenue in 2015

the rate at which our backlog converts to revenue may vary over time for a variety of reasons the revenue recognition on larger more global projects could be slower than on smaller less global projects for a variety of reasons including but not limited to an extended period of negotiation between the time the project is awarded to us and the actual execution of the contract as well as an increased timeframe for obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals additionally the increased complexity of clinical trials and the need to enroll precise patient populations could extend the length of clinical trials causing revenue to be recognized over a longer period of time further delayed projects will remain in backlog unless otherwise canceled by the customer and will not generate revenue at the rate originally expected thus the relationship of backlog to realized revenues may vary over time

our business depends on the continued effectiveness and availability of our information systems including the information systems we use to provide our services to our customers and failures of these systems may materially limit our operations

due to the global nature of our business and our reliance on information systems to provide our services we intend to increase our use of webenabled and other integrated information systems in delivering our services we also provide access to similar information systems to certain of our customers in connection with the services we provide them as the breadth and complexity of our information systems continue to grow we will increasingly be exposed to the risks inherent in the development integration and ongoing operation of evolving information systems including







 

the materialization of any of these risks may impede the processing of data the delivery of databases and services and the daytoday management of our business and could result in the corruption loss or unautho rized disclosure of proprietary confidential or other data while we have disaster recovery plans in place they might not adequately protect us in the event of a system failure despite any precautions we take damage from fire floods hurricanes power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses breakins and similar events at our various computer facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to our servers and from our servers to our customers corruption or loss of data may res ult in the need to repeat a clinical trial at no cost to the customer but at significant cost to us the termination of a contract or damage to our reputation additionally significant delays in system enhancements or inadequate performance of new or upg raded systems once completed could damage our reputation and harm our business finally longterm disruptions in the infrastructure caused by events such as natural disasters the outbreak of war the escalation of hostilities and acts of terrorism parti cularly involving cities in which we have offices could adversely affect our businesses although we carry property and business interruption insurance our coverage might not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur 

unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential data whether through systems failure or employee negligence fraud or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers similarly we have been and expect that we will continue to be subject to attempts to gain unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our customers whether by our employees or third parties including a cyber attack by computer programmers and hackers who may develop and deploy viruses worms or other malicious software programs to date these attacks have not had a material impact on our operations or financial results nonetheless successful attacks in the future could result in negative publicity significant remediation costs legal liability and damage to our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition our liability insurance might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches cyber attacks and other related breaches

we may be adversely affected by customer or therapeutic concentration

although we did not have any customer that represented 10 or more of our service revenues in 2015 2014 or 2013 we derive the majority of our revenues from a number of large customers if any large customer decreases or terminates its relationship with us our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected

additionally conducting multiple clinical trials for different customers in a single therapeutic class involving drugs with the same or similar chemical action has in the past and may in the future adversely affect our business if some or all of the clinical trials are canceled because of new scientific information or regulatory judgments that affect the drugs as a class or if industry consolidation results in the rationalization of drug development pipelines similarly marketing and selling drugs for different biopharmaceutical companies with similar chemical actions subjects us to risk if new scientific information or regulatory judgment prejudices the drugs as a class which may lead to compelled or voluntary prescription limitations or withdrawal of some or all of such drugs from the market

our business is subject to international economic political and other risks that could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition

we have significant operations in foreign countries that may require complex arrangements to deliver services on global contracts for our customers additionally we have established operations in locations remote from our most developed business centers as a result we are subject to heightened risks inherent in conducting business internationally including the following











 







these risks and uncertainties could negatively impact our ability to among other things perform large global projects for our customers furthermore our ability to deal with these issues could be affected by applicable united states laws and the need to protect our assets any such risks could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations

due to the global nature of our business we may be exposed to liabilities under the united states foreign corrupt practices act and various nonunited states anticorruption laws and any allegation or determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business

we are required to comply with the fcpa and other united states and nonunited states anticorruption laws which prohibit companies from engaging in bribery including corruptly or improperly offering promising or providing money or anything else of value to nonunited states officials and certain other recipients in addition the fcpa imposes certain books records and accounting control obligations on public companies and other issuers we operate in parts of the world in which corruption can be common and compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices our global operations face the risk of unauthorized payments or offers being made by employees consultants sales agents and other business partners outside of our control or without our authorization it is our policy to implement safeguards to prohibit these practices by our employees and business partners with respect to our operations however irrespective of these safeguards or as a result of monitoring compliance with such safeguards it is possible that we or certain other parties may discover or receive information at some point that certain employees consultants sales agents or other business partners may have engaged in corrupt conduct for which we might be held responsible violations of the fcpa or other nonunited states anticorruption laws may result in restatements of or irregularities in our financial statements as well as severe criminal or civil sanctions and we may be subject to other liabilities which could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition in some cases companies that violate the fcpa may be debarred by the united states government andor lose their united states export privileges changes in anticorruption laws or enforcement priorities could also result in increased compliance requirements and related costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition the united states or other governments may seek to hold us liable for successor liability fcpa violations or violations of other anticorruption laws committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquired or will acquire

if we are unable to successfully develop and market new services or enter new markets our growth results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected

a key element of our growth strategy is the successful development and marketing of new services or entering new markets that complement or expand our existing business as we develop new services or enter new markets including services targeted at participants in the broader healthcare industry we may not have or adequately build the competencies necessary to perform such services satisfactorily may not receive market acceptance for such services or may face increased competition if we are unable to succeed in developing new services entering new markets or attracting a customer base for our new services or in new markets we will be unable to implement this element of our growth strategy and our future business reputation results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected

upgrading the information systems that support our operating processes and evolving the technology platform for our services pose risks to our business

continued efficient operation of our business requires that we implement standardized global business processes and evolve our information systems to enable this implementation we have continued to undertake significant programs to optimize business processes with respect to our services our inability to effectively manage the implementation and adapt to new processes designed into these new or upgraded systems in a timely and costeffective manner may result in disruption to our business and negatively affect our operations

 

we have entered into agreements with cert ain vendors to provide systems development and integration services that develop or license to us the it platform for programs to optimize our business processes if such vendors fail to perform as required or if there are substantial delays in developing implementing and updating the it platform our customer delivery may be impaired and we may have to make substantial further investments internally or with third parties to achieve our objectives additionally our progress may be limited by parties wi th existing or claimed patents who seek to enjoin us from using preferred technology or seek license payments from us 

meeting our objectives is dependent on a number of factors which may not take place as we anticipate including obtaining adequate technologyenabled services creating itenabled services that our customers will find desirable and implementing our business model with respect to these services also increased itrelated expenditures may negatively impact our profitability

if we fail to perform our services in accordance with contractual requirements regulatory standards and ethical considerations we could be subject to significant costs or liability and our reputation could be harmed

we contract with biopharmaceutical companies to perform a wide range of services to assist them in bringing new drugs to market our services include monitoring clinical trials data and laboratory analysis edc patient recruitment and other related services such services are complex and subject to contractual requirements regulatory standards and ethical considerations for example we must adhere to regulatory requirements such as the fda and current gcp glp and gmp requirements if we fail to perform our services in accordance with these requirements regulatory agencies may take action against us for failure to comply with applicable regulations governing clinical trials or sales and marketing practices such actions may include sanctions such as injunctions or failure of such regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of products delay suspension or withdrawal of approvals license revocation product seizures or recalls operational restrictions civil or criminal penalties or prosecutions damages or fines customers may also bring claims against us for breach of our contractual obligations and patients in the clinical trials and patients taking drugs approved on the basis of those clinical trials may bring personal injury claims against us for negligence any such action could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and reputation

such consequences could arise if among other things the following occur

improper performance of our services the performance of clinical development services is complex and timeconsuming for example we may make mistakes in conducting a clinical trial that could negatively impact or obviate the usefulness of the clinical trial or cause the results of the clinical trial to be reported improperly if the clinical trial results are compromised we could be subject to significant costs or liability which could have an adverse impact on our ability to perform our services as examples 







large clinical trials can cost hundreds of millions of dollars and while we endeavor to contractually limit our exposure to such risks improper performance of our services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition damage our reputation and result in the cancellation of current contracts by or failure to obtain future contracts from the affected customer or other customers

investigation of customers from time to time one or more of our customers are audited or investigated by regulatory authorities or enforcement agencies with respect to regulatory compliance of their clinical trials programs or the marketing and sale of their drugs in these situations we have often provided services to our customers with respect to the clinical trials programs or activities being audited or investigated and we are called upon to respond to requests for information by the authorities and agencies there is a risk that either our customers or regulatory authorities could claim that we performed our services improperly or that we are responsible for clinical trial or program compliance if our customers or regulatory authorities make such claims against us and prove them we could be subject to damages fines or penalties in addition negative publicity regarding regulatory compliance of our customers’ clinical trials programs or drugs could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

insufficient customer funding to complete a clinical trial as noted above clinical trials can cost hundreds of millions of dollars there is a risk that we may initiate a clinical trial for a customer and then the customer becomes unwilling or unable to fund the completion of the clinical trial in such a situation notwithstanding the customer’s ability or willingness to pay for or otherwise facilitate the completion of the clinical trial we may be ethically bound to complete or wind down the clinical trial at our own expense 

 

our research and development services could subject us to potential liability that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our business involves the testing of new drugs on patients in clinical trials and if marketing approval is granted the availability of these drugs to be prescribed to patients our involvement in the clinical trials and development process creates a risk of liability for personal injury to or death of patients particularly those with lifethreatening illnesses resulting from adverse reactions to the drugs administered during testing or after product launch respectively for example we have from time to time been sued and may be sued in the future by individuals alleging personal injury due to their participation in clinical trials and seeking damages from us under a variety of legal theories although we maintain the types and amounts of insurance we view as customary in the industries and countries in which we operate if we are required to pay damages or incur defense costs in connection with any personal injury claim that is outside the scope of indemnification agreements we have with our customers if any indemnification agreement is not performed in accordance with its terms or if our liability exceeds the amount of any applicable indemnification limits or available insurance coverage our financial condition results of operations and reputation could be materially and adversely affected currently we maintain professional liability insurance including products liability for completed operations coverage with annual aggregate limits in excess of 500 million in the future we may not be able to get adequate insurance for these types of risks at reasonable rates

we also contract with physicians to serve as investigators in conducting clinical trials if the investigators commit errors or make omissions during a clinical trial that result in harm to clinical trial patients or after a clinical trial to a patient using the drug after it has received regulatory approval claims for personal injury or products liability damages may result additionally if the investigators engage in fraudulent behavior clinical trial data may be compromised which may require us to repeat the clinical trial or subject us to liability we do not believe we are legally responsible for the medical care rendered by such thirdparty investigators and we would vigorously defend any claims brought against us however it is possible we could be found liable for claims with respect to the actions of thirdparty investigators

some of our services involve direct interaction with clinical trial subjects or volunteers and operation of phase i clinical facilities which could create potential liability that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

we operate facilities where phase i clinical trials are conducted which ordinarily involve testing an investigational drug on a limited number of healthy individuals typically 20 to 80 persons to determine such drug’s basic safety failure to operate such a facility in accordance with applicable regulations could result in that facility being shut down which could disrupt our operations additionally we face risks associated with adverse events resulting from the administration of such drugs to healthy volunteers and the professional malpractice of medical care providers occasionally physicians employed at our phase i clinical facilities act as principal investigators in laterphase clinical trials at those same facilities we also directly employ nurses and other trained employees who assist in implementing the testing involved in our clinical trials such as drawing blood from healthy volunteers any professional malpractice or negligence by such investigators nurses or other employees could potentially result in liability to us in the event of personal injury to or death of a healthy volunteer in clinical trials this liability particularly if it were to exceed the limits of any indemnification agreements and insurance coverage we may have may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation

our commercial services could result in liability to us if a drug causes harm to a patient while we are generally indemnified and insured against such risks we may still suffer financial losses

when we market drugs under contract for a biopharmaceutical company we could suffer liability for harm allegedly caused by those drugs either as a result of a lawsuit against the biopharmaceutical company to which we are joined a lawsuit naming us or any of our subsidiaries or an action launched by a regulatory body while we are generally indemnified by the biopharmaceutical company for the action of the drugs we market on its behalf and we carry insurance to cover harm caused by our negligence in performing services it is possible that we could nonetheless incur financial losses regulatory penalties or both in particular any claim could result in potential liability for us if the claim is outside the scope of the indemnification agreement we have with the biopharmaceutical company the biopharmaceutical company does not abide by the indemnification agreement as required or the liability exceeds the amount of any applicable indemnification limits or available insurance coverage such a finding could have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and reputation furthermore negative publicity associated with harm caused by drugs we helped to market could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation

 

our insurance may not cover all of our indemnification obligat ions and other liabilities associated with our operations 

we maintain insurance designed to provide coverage for ordinary risks associated with our operations and our ordinary indemnification obligations with annual aggregate limits in excess of 500 million the coverage provided by such insurance may not be adequate for all claims we may make or may be contested by our insurance carriers if our insurance is not adequate or available to pay liabilities associated with our operations or if we are unable to purchase adequate insurance at reasonable rates in the future our profitability may be adversely impacted

if we are unable to attract suitable investigators and patients for our clinical trials our clinical development business might suffer

the recruitment of investigators and patients for clinical trials is essential to our business investigators are typically located at hospitals clinics or other sites and supervise the administration of the investigational drug to patients during the course of a clinical trial patients generally include people from the communities in which the clinical trials are conducted our clinical development business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract suitable and willing investigators or patients for clinical trials on a consistent basis for example if we are unable to engage investigators to conduct clinical trials as planned or enroll sufficient patients in clinical trials we might need to expend additional funds to obtain access to resources or else be compelled to delay or modify the clinical trial plans which may result in additional costs to us

if we lose the services of key personnel or are unable to recruit additional qualified personnel our business could be adversely affected

our success substantially depends on the collective performance contributions and expertise of our personnel including senior management and key personnel qualified professional scientific and technical operating staff and qualified sales representatives for our contract sales services there is significant and increasing competition for qualified personnel particularly those with higher educational degrees such as a medical degree a phd or an equivalent degree or relevant experience as a clinical research associate in the biopharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical services industries competition for qualified personnel in certain geographic regions such as north america and asia is putting additional pressure on our business in addition the departure of our key employees or our inability to continue to identify attract and retain qualified personnel or replace any departed personnel in a timely fashion may impact our ability to grow our business and compete effectively in our industry and may negatively affect our ability to meet financial and operational goals

exchange rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial condition

in 2015 approximately 32 of our service revenues were denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar because a large portion of our service revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar and our financial statements are reported in united states dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition exchange rate fluctuations between local currencies and the united states dollar create risk in several ways including

foreign currency translation risk the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies and translated into united states dollars for financial reporting purposes accordingly exchange rate fluctuations will affect the translation of foreign results into united states dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated results 

foreign currency transaction risk  we are subject to foreign currency transaction risk for fluctuations in exchange rates during the period of time between the consummation and cash settlement of a transaction we earn revenue from our service contracts over a period of several months and in some cases over several years accordingly exchange rate fluctuations during this period may affect our profitability with respect to such contracts 

we may limit these risks through exchange rate fluctuation provisions stated in our service contracts or we may hedge our transaction risk with foreign currency exchange contracts or options we have not however hedged 100 of our foreign currency transaction risk and we may experience fluctuations in financial results from our operations outside the united states and foreign currency transaction risk associated with our service contracts

 

disruptions in the credit and capital markets and unfavorable general econ omic conditions could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

disruptions in the credit and capital markets could have negative effects on our business that may be difficult to predict or anticipate including the ability of our customers vendors contractors and financing sources to meet their contractual obligations although we are unable to quantify the impact it has had on us we are aware of a limited number of instances during the past several years where cancellations changes in scope and failure to pay timely were attributable at least in part to difficulty in our customers’ ability to obtain financing in the future such actions by our customers could if they involve a significant amount of business with us have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

our effective income tax rate may fluctuate which may adversely affect our operations earnings and earnings per share

our effective income tax rate is influenced by our projected profitability in the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate changes in the distribution of profits and losses among taxing jurisdictions may have a significant impact on our effective income tax rate which in turn could have an adverse effect on our net income and earnings per share factors that may affect our effective income tax rate include but are not limited to













these changes may cause fluctuations in our effective income tax rate that could adversely affect our results of operations and cause fluctuations in our earnings and earnings per share

we have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights and these rights are important to our success

our success depends in part upon our ability to develop use and protect our proprietary methodologies analytics systems technologies and other intellectual property existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights and the protection in some countries may be very limited we rely upon a combination of trade secrets confidentiality policies nondisclosure invention assignment and other contractual arrangements and patent copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights these laws are subject to change at any time and certain agreements may not be fully enforceable which could further restrict our ability to protect our innovations our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing services similar to or duplicative of ours further the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors former employees or other third parties and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights enforcing our rights might also require considerable time money and oversight and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights

depending on the circumstances we might need to grant a specific customer greater rights in intellectual property developed in connection with a contract than we otherwise generally do in certain situations we might forego all rights to the use of intellectual property we create which would limit our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other customers any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenuegenerating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop or license new or modified solutions for future projects

 

our relationships with existing or potential customers who are in competition with each other may adversely imp act the degree to which other customers or potential customers use our services which may adversely affect our results of operations 

the biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive with biopharmaceutical companies each seeking to persuade payers providers and patients that their drug therapies are better and more costeffective than competing therapies marketed or being developed by competing firms in addition to the adverse competitive interests that biopharmaceutical companies have with each other biopharmaceutical companies also have adverse interests with respect to drug selection and reimbursement with other participants in the healthcare industry including payers and providers biopharmaceutical companies also compete to be first to market with new drug therapies we regularly provide services to biopharmaceutical companies who compete with each other and we sometimes provide services or funding to such customers regarding competing drugs in development our existing or future relationships with our biopharmaceutical customers may therefore deter other biopharmaceutical customers from using our services or may result in our customers seeking to place limits on our ability to serve other biopharmaceutical industry participants in addition our further expansion into the broader healthcare market may adversely impact our relationships with biopharmaceutical customers and such customers may elect not to use our services reduce the scope of services that we provide to them or seek to place restrictions on our ability to serve customers in the broader healthcare market with interests that are adverse to theirs a loss of customers or reductions in the level of revenues from a customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations business and prospects

if we are unable to successfully identify acquire and integrate existing businesses services and technologies our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted

we anticipate that a portion of our future growth may come from acquiring existing businesses services or technologies the success of any acquisition will depend upon among other things our ability to effectively integrate acquired personnel operations products and technologies into our business and to retain the key personnel and customers of our acquired businesses in addition we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or obtain any necessary financing on commercially acceptable terms we may also spend time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition targets but not complete the transaction any future acquisition could involve other risks including among others the assumption of additional liabilities and expenses difficulties and expenses in connection with integrating the acquired companies and achieving the expected benefits issuances of potentially dilutive securities or interestbearing debt loss of key employees of the acquired companies transaction costs diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and with respect to the acquisition of foreign companies the inability to overcome differences in foreign business practices language and customs our failure to identify potential acquisitions complete targeted acquisitions and integrate completed acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

investments in our customers’ businesses or drugs and our related commercial rights strategies could have a negative impact on our financial performance

we may enter into arrangements with our customers or other drug companies in which we take on some of the risk of the potential success or failure of their businesses or drugs including making strategic investments in our customers or other drug companies providing financing to customers or other drug companies or acquiring an interest in the revenues from customers’ drugs or in entities developing a limited number of drugs as of december 31 2015 we had approximately 511 million of such arrangements and we were also committed to invest an additional 327 million in private equity funds that seeks to enter into similar riskbased arrangements our financial results would be adversely affected if these investments or the underlying drugs result in losses or do not achieve the level of success that we anticipate andor our return or payment from the drug investment or financing is less than our direct and indirect costs with respect to these arrangements

our results of operations may be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our goodwill and intangible assets

as of december 31 2015 we had goodwill and net intangible assets of 10878 million which constituted approximately 277 of our total assets at the end of this period we assess the realizability of our indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill annually and conduct an interim evaluation whenever events or changes in circumstances such as operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset indicate that these assets may be impaired our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of the businesses we have acquired which in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses into our own business if we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets such impairment charges could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition

 

we face risks arising from the restructuring of our operations 

from time to time we have adopted restructuring plans to improve our operating efficiency through various means such as reduction of overcapacity elimination of nonbillable support roles or other realignment of resources for example during 2015 and 2014 we recognized 308 million and 90 million respectively of restructuring charges net of reversals for changes in estimates related to restructuring plans restructuring presents significant potential risks of events occurring that could adversely affect us including











because of these and other factors we cannot predict whether we will realize the purpose and anticipated benefits of these measures and if we do not our business and results of operations may be adversely affected

additionally there may be delays in implementing the restructuring activities or a failure to achieve the anticipated levels of cost savings and efficiency as a result of the restructuring activities each of which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations further restructuring or reorganization activities may also be required in the future beyond what is currently planned which could further enhance the risks associated with these activities

we depend on third parties for critical support services

we depend on third parties for support services vital to our business such support services include but are not limited to thirdparty transportation providers suppliers of drugs for patients participating in clinical trials suppliers of kits for use in our clinical trial laboratories business suppliers of reagents for use in our testing equipment and providers of maintenance contracts for our equipment the failure of any of these third parties to adequately provide the critical support services could have a material adverse effect on our business

risks relating to our industry

the biopharmaceutical services industry is highly competitive

the biopharmaceutical services industry is highly competitive we often compete for business with other biopharmaceutical services companies internal discovery departments development departments and sales and marketing departments within our customers some of which could be considered large biopharmaceutical services companies in their own right with greater resources than ours we also compete with universities and teaching hospitals if we do not compete successfully our business will suffer the industry is highly fragmented with numerous smaller specialized companies and a handful of fullservice companies with global capabilities similar to ours increased competition has led to price and other forms of competition such as acceptance of less favorable contract terms that could adversely affect our operating results there are few barriers to entry for smaller specialized companies considering entering the industry because of their size and focus these companies might compete effectively against larger companies such as us which could have a material adverse impact on our business

outsourcing trends in the biopharmaceutical industry and changes in aggregate spending and research and development budgets could adversely affect our operating results and growth rate

economic factors and industry trends that affect biopharmaceutical companies affect our business biopharmaceutical companies continue to seek longterm strategic collaborations with global cros with favorable pricing terms competition for these collaborations is intense and we may decide to forego an opportunity or we may not be selected in which case a competitor may enter into the collaboration and our business with the customer if any may be limited in addition if the biopharmaceutical industry reduces its outsourcing of clinical trials and sales and marketing projects or such outsourcing fails to grow at projected rates our operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected we may also be negatively impacted by consolidation and other factors in the biopharmaceutical industry which may slow decision making by our customers or result in the delay or cancellation of clinical trials our commercial services may be affected by reductions in new drug launches and increases in the number of drugs losing patent protection all of these events could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition

 

we may be affected by healthcare reform and potential additional reforms 

the united states congress continues to consider healthcare reform legislation and impose health industry cost containment measures which may significantly impact the biopharmaceutical industry in addition numerous government bodies are considering or have adopted various healthcare reforms and may undertake or are in the process of undertaking efforts to control growing healthcare costs through legislation regulation and voluntary agreements with medical care providers and biopharmaceutical companies we are uncertain as to the effects of these recent reforms on our business and are unable to predict what legislative proposals if any will be adopted in the future if regulatory cost containment efforts limit the profitability of new drugs our customers may reduce their research and development spending or promotional marketing and sales expenditures which could reduce the business they outsource to us similarly if regulatory requirements are relaxed or simplified drug approval procedures are adopted the demand for our services could decrease

foreign and domestic government bodies may also adopt healthcare legislation or regulations that are more burdensome than existing regulations for example product safety concerns and recommendations by the drug safety oversight board could change the regulatory environment for drug products and new or heightened regulatory and licensing requirements may increase our expenses or limit or delay our ability to offer some of our services additionally new or heightened regulatory requirements may have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to conduct industrysponsored clinical trials which could reduce the need for our services

actions by government regulators or customers to limit a prescription’s scope or withdraw an approved drug from the market could adversely affect our business and result in a loss of revenues

government regulators have the authority after approving a drug to limit its scope of prescription or withdraw it from the market completely based on safety concerns similarly customers may act to voluntarily limit the scope of prescription of drugs or withdraw them from the market in the past we have provided services with respect to drugs that have been limited andor withdrawn if we are providing services to customers for drugs that are limited or withdrawn we may be required to narrow the scope of or terminate our services with respect to such drugs which would prevent us from earning the full amount of service revenues anticipated under the related service contracts with negative impacts to our financial results

current and proposed laws and regulations regarding the protection of personal data could result in increased risks of liability or increased cost to us or could limit our service offerings

the confidentiality collection use and disclosure of personal data including clinical trial patientspecific information are subject to governmental regulation generally in the country that the personal data were collected or used for example united states federal regulations under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa and as amended in 2014 by the health information technology for economic and clinical health “hitech” act require individuals’ written authorization in addition to any required informed consent before protected health information may be used for research such regulations specify standards for deidentifications and for limited data sets we are both directly and indirectly affected by the privacy provisions surrounding individual authorizations because many investigators with whom we are involved in clinical trials are directly subject to them as a hipaa “covered entity” and because we obtain identifiable health information from third parties that are subject to such regulations as there are some instances where we are a hipaa “business associate” of a “covered entity” we can also be directly liable for mishandling protected health information under hipaa’s enforcement scheme we can be subject to up to 15 million in annual civil penalties for each hipaa violation

 

in the eu personal data includes any information that relates to an identified or iden tifiable natural person with health information carrying additional obligations including obtaining the explicit consent from the individual for collection use or disclosure of the information in addition we are subject to eu rules with respect to cros sborder transfers of such data out of the eu the united states the eu and its member states and other countries where we have operations such as japan south korea malaysia the philippines russia and singapore continue to issue new privacy and dat a protection rules and regulations that relate to personal data and health information failure to comply with certain certificationregistration and annual recertificationregistration provisions associated with these data protection and privacy regulati ons and rules in various jurisdictions or to resolve any serious privacy complaints could subject us to regulatory sanctions criminal prosecution or civil liability federal state and foreign governments are contemplating or have proposed or adopted ad ditional legislation governing the collection possession use or dissemination of personal data such as personal health information and personal financial data as well as security breach notification rules for loss or theft of such data additional legi slation or regulation of this type might among other things require us to implement new security measures and processes or bring within the legislation or regulation deidentified health or other personal data each of which may require substantial expen ditures or limit our ability to offer some of our services additionally if we violate applicable laws regulations or duties relating to the use privacy or security of personal data we could be subject to civil liability or criminal prosecution be for ced to alter our business practices and suffer reputational harm in the next few years the european data protection framework may be revised as a generally applicable data regulation the text has not yet been finalized but it contains new provisions sp ecifically directed at the processing of health information sanctions of up to 4 of worldwide gross revenue and extraterritoriality measures intended to bring noneu companies under the proposed regulation 

if we do not keep pace with rapid technological changes our services may become less competitive or obsolete

the biopharmaceutical industry generally and drug development and clinical research more specifically are subject to rapid technological changes our current competitors or other businesses might develop technologies or services that are more effective or commercially attractive than or render obsolete our current or future technologies and services if our competitors introduce superior technologies or services and if we cannot make enhancements to remain competitive our competitive position would be harmed if we are unable to compete successfully we may lose customers or be unable to attract new customers which could lead to a decrease in our revenue and financial condition

the biopharmaceutical industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and we might be involved in costly intellectual property lawsuits

the biopharmaceutical industry has a history of intellectual property litigation and these lawsuits will likely continue in the future accordingly we may face patent infringement suits by companies that have patents for similar business processes or other suits alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights legal proceedings relating to intellectual property could be expensive take significant time and divert management’s attention from other business concerns regardless of the outcome of the litigation if we do not prevail in an infringement lawsuit brought against us we might have to pay substantial damages and we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license to use technology on unfavorable terms

our customers face intense competition from lower cost generic products which may lower the amount that they spend on our services

our customers face increasing competition from lower cost generic products which in turn may affect their ability to pursue research and development activities with us in the united states eu and japan political pressure to reduce spending on prescription drugs has led to legislation and other measures which encourages the use of generic products in addition proposals emerge from time to time in the united states and other countries for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by generic substitutes reducing our customers’ sales of that product and their overall profitability availability of generic substitutes for our customers’ drugs may adversely affect their results of operations and cash flow which in turn may mean that they would not have surplus capital to invest in research and development and drug commercialization including in our services if competition from generic products impacts our customers’ finances such that they decide to curtail our services our revenues may decline and this could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

risks relating to our indebtedness 

our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial condition

as of december 31 2015 we had 25 billion of total indebtedness excluding 5340 million of additional available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and thus make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness if our cash flow is not sufficient to service our debt and adequately fund our business we may be required to seek further additional financing or refinancing or dispose of assets we may not be able to implement any of these alternatives on satisfactory terms or at all our substantial indebtedness could also

















despite our level of indebtedness we are able to incur more debt and undertake additional obligations incurring such debt or undertaking such additional obligations could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition

although our credit agreement which governs the senior credit facilities of our wholly owned subsidiary through which we conduct our operations quintiles transnational corp or quintiles transnational contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could increase in addition the receivables financing agreement for our special purpose subsidiary quintiles funding llc or quintiles funding limits borrowing based on the amount of receivables purchased by quintiles funding from certain of our other subsidiaries but when supported by the value of such purchased receivables the debt under our receivables financing facility can increase as of december 31 2015 we had 5340 million of additional available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities

while the credit agreement also contains restrictions on our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to make loans and investments these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the investments incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial

if we do not comply with the covenants governing our credit facilities and senior notes we may not have the funds necessary to pay all of our indebtedness that could become due

the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities requires us to comply with certain covenants in particular our credit agreement prohibits us from incurring any additional indebtedness except in specified circumstances or amending the terms of agreements relating to certain existing junior indebtedness if any in a manner materially adverse to the lenders under our credit agreement without lender approval further our credit agreement contains customary covenants including covenants that restrict our ability to acquire and dispose of assets engage in mergers or reorganizations pay dividends or make investments our credit agreement contains one financial covenant which is a total leverage ratio that provides for a maximum ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters measured as of the end of such period of 575 to 100 see liquidity and capital resources included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for more information on our covenants governing our credit facilities in addition our credit agreement requires us to make mandatory principal prepayments in certain circumstances including with a portion of our excess cash flow if quintiles transnational’s total leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement exceeds certain levels a violation of any of these covenants could cause an event of default under our credit agreement

 

the receivables financing agreement for our receivables financing facility requires certain of our subsidiaries to transfer receivables with adequate value to the lender under that facility to support repayment of amounts outstanding in the eve nt such transferred receivables are insufficient to support such outstanding amounts we will be required to make prepayments under the receivables financing agreement failure to make such prepayments or violations of the covenants in the receivables fina ncing agreement could cause an event of default under the receivables financing agreement 

the indenture governing the senior notes of quintiles transnational requires us to comply with certain covenants including covenants that limit our ability to create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions in addition u pon the occurrence of a change in control of quintiles transnational each holder of senior notes may require quintiles transnational to repurchase all or a portion of the senior notes in cash at a price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon a violation of any of these covenants could cause an event of default under our indenture

if we default on our senior secured credit agreement our receivables financing agreement or our senior notes as a result of our failure to pay principal or interest when due our material breach of any representation warranty or covenant or any other reason all outstanding amounts could become immediately due and payable under any or all of such agreements in such case we may not have sufficient funds to repay all the outstanding amounts in addition or in the alternative the lenders under our senior secured credit agreement could exercise their rights under the security documents entered into in connection with the senior secured credit agreement any acceleration of amounts due under the credit agreement governing our outstanding indebtedness or the substantial exercise by the lenders under our senior secured credit agreement of their rights under the security documents would likely have a material adverse effect on us

interest rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial condition

because we have variable rate debt fluctuations in interest rates affect our business we attempt to minimize interest rate risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps we have entered into interest rate swaps with financial institutions that have reset dates and critical terms that match those of our senior secured term loan credit facility accordingly any change in market value associated with the interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt as of december 31 2015 we had approximately 17 billion of variable rate indebtedness in june 2015 we entered into seven forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional value of 4400 million which will be effective june 30 2016 at which time we will have approximately 12 billion of variable rate indebtedness the interest rate swaps expire between march 31 2017 and march 31 2020 because we do not attempt to hedge all of our variable rate debt we may incur higher interest costs for the portion of our variable rate debt which is not hedged once the interest rate swaps are effective each quarterpoint increase or decrease in the variable interest rate would result in our interest expense changing by approximately 31 million per year under our unhedged variable rate debt

risks relating to ownership of our common stock

provisions of our corporate governance documents could make an acquisition of our company more difficult and may prevent attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management even if beneficial to our shareholders

provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a merger acquisition or other change in control of our company that shareholders may consider favorable including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock thereby depressing the market price of our common stock in addition these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove members of our board because our board is responsible for appointing the members of our management team these provisions could in turn frustrate or prevent any attempt to replace or remove current members of our management team among others these provisions include i our ability to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval ii the requirement that our shareholders may not act without a meeting iii requirements for advance notification of shareholder nominations and proposals contained in our bylaws iv the absence of cumulative voting for our directors v requirements for shareholder approval of certain business combinations and vi the limitations on director nominations

 

our operating results and share price may be volatile which could cause the value of our shareholders’ investments to decline 

our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future and such fluctuations may be significant in addition securities markets worldwide have experienced and are likely to continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could subject the market price of our shares to wide price fluctuations regardless of our operating performance our operating results and the trading price of our shares may fluctuate in response to various factors including





















these and other factors many of which are beyond our control may cause our operating results and the market price for our shares to fluctuate substantially while we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares and may otherwise negatively affect the market price and liquidity of our shares in addition in the past when the market price of a stock has been volatile holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock if any of our shareholders brought a lawsuit against us we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation

there may be sales of a substantial amount of our common stock by our current shareholders and these sales could cause the price of our common stock to fall

as of february 4 2016 there were 119384993 shares of common stock outstanding approximately 302 of our outstanding common stock is held by parties to the shareholders agreement

sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales will occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for us to raise funds through securities offerings in the future

shareholders that are a party to an amended and restated registration rights agreement or the registration rights agreement may require us to register their shares for resale under the federal securities laws under the registration rights agreement we are required to pay the registration expenses associated with the registration of such shares not including the underwriting discounts commissions and transfer taxes registration of those shares would allow those shareholders to immediately resell their shares in the public market any such sales or the anticipation of such sales may cause the market price of our common stock to decline

since we have no current plans to pay regular cash dividends on our common stock shareholders may not receive any return on investment unless they sell their common stock for a price greater than that which they paid for it

although we have previously declared dividends to our shareholders we do not currently anticipate paying any regular cash dividends on our common stock any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board and will depend on among other things our results of operations financial condition cash requirements contractual restrictions and other factors that our board may deem relevant in addition our ability to pay dividends is and may be limited by covenants of existing and any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur including under our existing credit facilities therefore any return on investment in our common stock is solely dependent upon the appreciation of the price of our common stock on the open market which may not occur see part ii item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities—policy” for more detail

 

the parties to the shareholders agreement have significant influence over us including decisions that require the approval of our shareholders which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to shareholders for a vote 

the parties to the shareholders agreement own approximately 302 of the outstanding shares of our common stock among other things the shareholders agreement requires such shareholders to vote in favor of certain nominees to our board as a result this group potentially has the ability to influence our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and the terms thereof any change in the composition of our board and any transaction that requires shareholder approval regardless of whether others believe that such change or transaction is in our best interests additionally the parties to the shareholders agreement are in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us one or more of the parties to the shareholders agreement may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us so long as the parties to the shareholders agreement continue to own a significant amount of our equity if they exercise their shareholder rights collectively they will be able to significantly influence our decisions

our amended and restated articles of incorporation contain a provision renouncing any interest and expectancy in certain corporate opportunities identified by certain of our affiliates even if such corporate opportunities are ones that we might reasonably be deemed to have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue

our amended and restated articles of incorporation provide for the allocation of certain corporate opportunities between us on the one hand and certain of our shareholders on the other hand as set forth in our amended and restated articles of incorporation neither such shareholders nor any director officer shareholder member manager or employee of such shareholders have any fiduciary duty or any other duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate to the full extent permitted by applicable law we have renounced any interest or expectancy in or in being offered an opportunity to participate in business opportunities that are from time to time presented to certain of our shareholders even if the opportunity is one that we might reasonably deem to have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so and each such shareholders shall have no duty to communicate or offer such business opportunity to us and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law shall not be liable to us or to the extent applicable any of its or their shareholders for breach of any fiduciary or other duty as a director or officer or otherwise by reason of the fact that such shareholders pursues or acquires such business opportunity directs such business opportunity to another person or fails to present such business opportunity or information regarding such business opportunity to us therefore a director or officer of our company who also serves as a director officer member manager or employee of such shareholders may pursue certain business opportunities including acquisitions that may be complementary to our business and as a result such opportunities may not be available to us these potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects if attractive corporate opportunities are allocated by such shareholders to themselves or their other affiliates instead of to us

overview

our business is currently organized in two reportable segments product development and integrated healthcare services

for the year ended december 31 2015 our service revenues increased 1606 million or 39 to 43 billion at actual foreign exchange rates compared to 2014 our growth in service revenues excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations “constant currency” was 3729 million or 90 with 2235 million or 72 growth in the product development segment and 1494 million or 140 growth in the integrated healthcare services segment

our net income attributable to quintiles transnational holdings inc was 3872 million with diluted earnings per share of 308 for the year ended december 31 2015

net new business was 5319 million for the year ended december 31 2015 this net new business contributed to an ending backlog of 12038 million at december 31 2015 “net new business” and “backlog” are defined under “net new business reporting and backlog” in part i item 1 “business” of this annual report on form 10k 

product development

product development provides services and expertise that allow biopharmaceutical companies to outsource the clinical development process from firstinman clinical trials to postlaunch monitoring our comprehensive service offerings provide the support and functional expertise necessary at each stage of development as well as the systems and analytical capabilities to help our customers improve product development efficiency and effectiveness product development is comprised of clinical solutions and services and advisory services formerly consulting services clinical solutions and services provides services necessary to develop biopharmaceutical products these services include project management and clinical monitoring functions for conducting multisite clinical trials generally phase iiiv collectively “core clinical” these also include clinical trial support services that improve clinical trial decisionmaking such as global clinical trial laboratories data management biostatistical safety and pharmacovigilance early clinical development trials generally phase i and strategic planning and design services which help improve decisions and performance we also provide functional resourcing services that cover a range of areas advisory services provides strategy and management advisory services based on life science expertise and advanced analytics as well as regulatory and compliance advisory services

integrated healthcare services

integrated healthcare services provides a broad array of services including commercial services such as providing contract pharmaceutical sales forces in key geographic markets as well as a growing number of healthcare business services for the broader healthcare sector our customized commercialization services are designed to accelerate the commercial success of biopharmaceutical and other healthrelated products service offerings include commercial services sales representatives strategy marketing communications and other areas related to market access and commercialization realworld and late phase research drug therapy analysis realworld research and evidencebased medicine including research studies to prove a drug’s value other healthcare services comparative and costeffectiveness research capabilities decision support services communication services and health engagement medication adherence and health outcome optimization services and webbased systems for measuring quality improvement and ehr implementation and advisory services

 

industry outlook 

the potential of the cro market served by product development is primarily a function of two variables biopharmaceutical research and development spending and the proportion of this spending that is outsourced outsourcing penetration we expect outsourced clinical development to cros to increase 68 annually from 2015 to 2018 and believe this annual growth will be driven largely by increased outsourcing penetration with up to 2 of this growth coming from increased research and development expenditures over 2015 to 2018 in estimating these growth rates we monitor the ability of biopharmaceutical companies including biotechnology companies to raise capital as well as the potential impact from merger and acquisition activity between biopharmaceutical companies we estimate that overall outsourcing penetration of the addressable market in 2015 was 41 and believe that our customers will continue to outsource a greater part of their activities to transform their value chain away from a vertically integrated model and focus on their core competencies to lower risk and improve return with a focus on selecting outsourcing partners that are able to demonstrate the ability to provide flexible and efficient delivery models that leverage patient data to help biopharmaceutical companies deliver more effective patient outcomes we believe that increased demand will create new opportunities for biopharmaceutical services companies particularly those with a global reach

integrated healthcare services historically has focused on biopharmaceutical companies seeking to commercialize their products the total market served by integrated healthcare services is diverse which makes it difficult to estimate the current amount of outsourced integrated healthcare services and the expected growth in such services however based on our knowledge of these markets we believe that while the rate of outsourcing penetration varies by market within integrated healthcare services the overall outsourcing penetration of the estimated 101 billion market is approximately 23 we believe that the market for realworld and late phase research and other healthcare services will evolve and expand and as a result there will be opportunities to grow our revenues and expand our service offerings as business models continue to evolve in the healthcare sector we believe based on industry data analysis and our own estimates that the growth rate for outsourcing across the integrated healthcare services markets should increase 68 annually from 2015 to 2018

business combinations

we completed a number of business combinations in 2013 2014 and 2015 to enhance our capabilities and offerings in certain areas in september 2013 we acquired novella clinical inc or novella for approximately 1466 million net of approximately 262 million of acquired cash with contingent consideration of up to 210 million to complement our product development segment service offerings through its focus on emerging companies and by adding expertise in oncology and medical devices in july 2014 we completed the acquisition of encore for approximately 915 million in cash net of approximately 22 million of acquired cash to enhance our ehr expertise within our integrated healthcare services segment in july 2015 we combined our global clinical trials laboratory operations in our product development segment with the clinical trials laboratory operations of quest with the resulting combined business referred to as q 2 solutions we own 60 of q 2 solutions and quest owns the remaining 40 see note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information with respect to these business combinations the results of operations of acquired businesses have been included since the date of acquisition and were not significant to our consolidated results of operations

sources of revenue

total revenues are comprised of service revenues and revenues from reimbursed expenses service revenues primarily include the revenue we earn from providing product development and commercialization services to our customers with product development services representing 738 of our 2015 service revenues and integrated healthcare services representing 262 of our 2015 service revenues reimbursed expenses are comprised principally of payments to physicians investigators who oversee clinical trials and travel expenses for our clinical monitors and sales representatives reimbursed expenses may fluctuate from periodtoperiod due in part to where we are in the lifecycle of the many contracts that are in progress at a particular point in time for instance these passthrough costs tend to be higher during the early phases of clinical trials as a result of patient recruitment efforts as reimbursed expenses are passthrough costs to our customers with little to no profit and we believe that the fluctuations from periodtoperiod are not meaningful to our underlying performance we do not provide analysis of the fluctuations in these items or their impact on our financial results

costs and expenses

our costs and expenses are comprised primarily of our costs of revenues and selling general and administrative expenses

 

our costs of revenues consist of service costs and reimbursed expenses service costs include com pensation and benefits for billable employees depreciation of assets used in generating revenue and other expenses directly related to service contracts such as courier fees laboratory supplies professional services and travel expenses as noted above reimbursed expenses are comprised principally of payments to physicians investigators who oversee clinical trials and travel expenses for our clinical monitors and sales representatives 

selling general and administrative expenses include costs related to administrative functions including compensation and benefits travel professional services training and expenses for advertising it facilities and depreciation and amortization

foreign currency translation

in 2015 approximately 32 of our service revenues were denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar because a large portion of our service revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar and our financial statements are reported in united states dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly affect our results of operations the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies and translated into united states dollars for financial reporting purposes accordingly exchange rate fluctuations will affect the translation of foreign results into united states dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated results in 2015 foreign exchange rates in certain currencies in which we do business have fluctuated significantly as compared to the prior year particularly the euro the japanese yen and the british pound

as a result we believe that providing the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on certain financial results can facilitate analysis of periodtoperiod comparisons of business performance the impact from foreign currency fluctuations and constant currency information assumes constant foreign currency exchange rates based on the rates in effect for the comparable prioryear period were used in translation

year ended december 31 2015 compared to the year ended december 31 2014 and the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the year ended december 31 2013

backlog and net new business

2015 compared to 2014

backlog at december 31 2015 was 12038 million which was 7 higher than 2014 including the incremental impact from the businesses that quest contributed to q 2 solutions

net new business decreased 51 including a negative impact from foreign currency in 2015 to 5319 million from 5602 million in 2014 driven by decreases in both product development and integrated healthcare services product development’s net new business decreased 58 in 2015 to 4121 million from 4374 million in 2014 product development had growth in net new business in 2015 from core clinical services and global clinical trial laboratory services including the incremental impact from the businesses that quest contributed to q 2 solutions these increases were more than offset by lower net new business for functional resourcing services primarily because 2014 included renewals for two fiveyear contracts integrated healthcare services’ net new business decreased 25 in 2015 to 1198 million from 1228 million in 2014 related primarily to cancellations in north america as well as lower signings for commercial services in europe partially offset by net new business growth from the encore acquisition which closed in july 2014 and from realworld and late phase research services

2014 compared to 2013

backlog at december 31 2014 was 11244 million which was 14 higher than 2013

 

net new business grew 14 in 2014 to 5602 million from 4899 million in 2013 driven by growth in both product development and integrated healthcare services product development’ s net new business increased 16 in 2014 to 4374 million from 3772 million in 2013 led by higher growth in net new business for functional resourcing services which included renewals of two fiveyear contracts growth in net new business for core cli nical services in asia as well as net new business generated from the novella acquisition and clinical trial support services including early clinical development and lifecycle safety integrated healthcare services’ net new business increased 9 in 2014 to 1228 million from 1127 million in 2013 related primarily to growth in commercial services in north america an increase in new business from realworld and late phase research services and net new business from the encore acquisition 

our backlog at december 31 2015 was 12038 million compared to backlog of 11244 million at december 31 2014 although an increase in backlog will generally result in an increase in revenues to be recognized over time depending on the level of contract modifications an increase in backlog at a particular point in time does not necessarily correspond directly to an increase in revenues during a particular period the extent to which contracts in backlog will result in revenue depends on many factors including but not limited to delivery against projected schedules the need for scope changes change orders contract cancellations and the nature duration size complexity and phase of the contracts each of which factors can vary significantly from time to time revenue recognition occurs over extended periods of time and is subject to unanticipated delays fluctuations in our reported backlog and net new business levels may result from a small number of relatively large orders in any given reporting period that may be included in our backlog and net new business because of these large orders our backlog and net new business in that reporting period may reach levels that may not be sustained in subsequent reporting periods our 12038 million of backlog at december 31 2015 included approximately 8188 million of backlog that we do not expect to generate revenue in 2016 as compared to our 11244 million of backlog at december 31 2014 which included approximately 7593 million of backlog that we did not expect to generate revenue in 2015 our ability to grow revenues in the near term at rates comparable to our recent historical results will depend on many factors including but not limited to the factors affecting the rate at which revenues are derived from backlog continued growth in net new business that will generate revenue and factors not within our control such as economic conditions and trends in the industry in which we do business

service revenues

 



2015 compared to 2014

in 2015 our service revenues increased 1606 million or 39 as compared to 2014 this increase was comprised of constant currency service revenue growth of approximately 3729 million or 90 and a negative impact of approximately 2123 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency service revenue growth was comprised of a 2235 million increase in product development which includes the incremental impact from the businesses that quest contributed to q 2 solutions and a 1494 million increase in integrated healthcare services which includes the impact from the encore acquisition which closed in july 2014

2014 compared to 2013

in 2014 our service revenues increased 3575 million or 94 as compared to 2013 this increase is comprised of constant currency revenue growth of approximately 3832 million or 101 offset by a negative impact of approximately 257 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency service revenue growth which includes the impact from the novella and encore acquisitions is comprised of a 1832 million increase in product development and a 2000 million increase in integrated healthcare services

costs of revenue service costs

 



 

2015 compared to 2014 

when compared to 2014 service costs in 2015 increased 415 million this increase included a constant currency increase in expenses of approximately 2395 million or 89 partially offset by a positive impact of approximately 1980 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency growth was comprised of a 1400 million increase in product development which included the incremental impact from the businesses that quest contributed to q 2 solutions and a 995 million increase in integrated healthcare services which included the impact from the encore acquisition which closed in july 2014

the decrease in service costs as a percent of service revenues for 2015 was primarily as a result of an improvement in constant currency profit margin in both the product development and integrated healthcare services segments as more fully described in the segment discussion later in this section for 2015 this constant currency profit margin expansion was partially offset by the effect from a higher proportion of consolidated service revenues being contributed by our lower margin integrated healthcare services segment when compared to 2014 as well as a negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations

2014 compared to 2013

when compared to 2013 service costs in 2014 increased 2127 million the increase included a constant currency increase in expenses of approximately 2535 million or 103 partially offset by a positive impact of approximately 408 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency growth was comprised of a 940 million increase in product development and a 1595 million increase in integrated healthcare services which included the impact from the encore acquisition which closed in july 2014

selling general and administrative

 



2015 compared to 2014

the 387 million increase in selling general and administrative expenses in 2015 included a constant currency increase of 808 million or 92 partially offset by a positive impact of approximately 421 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency growth was comprised of a 472 million increase in product development which included the incremental impact from the businesses that quest contributed to q 2 solutions a 207 million increase in integrated healthcare services which included the impact from the encore acquisition which closed in july 2014 and a 129 million increase in general corporate and unallocated expenses the constant currency increase in 2015 for general corporate and unallocated expenses was primarily due to an increase in sharebased compensation and costs associated with the q 2 solutions transaction

2014 compared to 2013

the 218 million increase in selling general and administrative expenses in 2014 included a constant currency increase of 293 million or 34 partially offset by a positive impact of approximately 75 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency growth was comprised of a 336 million increase in product development which includes the impact from the novella acquisition which closed in september 2013 and a 130 million increase in integrated healthcare services which includes the impact from the encore acquisition which closed in july 2014 the constant currency growth was partially offset by a 173 million decrease in general corporate and unallocated expenses the constant currency decrease in 2014 for general corporate and unallocated expenses was primarily due to expenses incurred in 2013 that did not recur in 2014 including a 250 million fee paid in connection with the termination of our management agreement with affiliates of certain of our shareholders approximately 53 million of executive separation costs and a 15 million fee paid in connection with the modification of an agreement for the business usage of an airplane owned by gf management company llc or gfm a company controlled by our former executive chairman who retired effective december 31 2015 but remains one of our directors these decreases in general corporate and unallocated expenses were partially offset by an increase in sharebased compensation and increases in compensation and related expenses resulting primarily from annual merit increases and an increase in headcount

 

restructuring costs 

 



during 2015 we recognized 308 million of restructuring charges net of reversals for changes in estimates associated with both the february 2015 restructuring plan and the q 2 solutions restructuring plan the remaining actions under these plans are expected to occur throughout 2016 and 2017 and are expected to consist of severance facility closure and other exitrelated costs we believe that these plans will result in annualized cost savings of approximately 500 million to 600 million

during 2014 we recognized 90 million of restructuring charges net of reversals for changes in estimates which was primarily related to our 2014 restructuring plans to better align our resources with our strategic direction

during 2013 we recognized 141 million of restructuring charges net of reversals for changes in estimates which was primarily related to our february 2013 restructuring plan to migrate the delivery of services and to reduce anticipated overcapacity in selected areas

impairment charges

 



during the fourth quarter of 2015 we exited a training facility in japan that is being actively marketed for sale resulting in a 25 million impairment of the land and building

interest income and interest expense

 



interest income included interest received primarily from bank balances and investments

interest expense during 2015 was slightly higher than 2014 due to an increase in the average debt outstanding primarily as a result of the 2750 million term loan that was issued under the receivables financing facility in december 2014 and our new senior secured credit agreement and senior notes both of which are described in liquidity and capital resources this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average rate of interest incurred on our debt as compared to 2014

interest expense during 2014 was lower than 2013 in part due to a decrease in the average rate of interest the average rate of interest on the term loan under our senior secured credit facility during 2014 was lower than it was during 2013 due to a reduction in the interest rate pursuant to the terms and conditions in the credit agreement as well as from the refinancing transaction we completed in the fourth quarter of 2013 in addition to the lower average rate of interest interest expense during 2014 also benefited from a decrease in the average debt outstanding as a result of the repayment of the 3000 million term loan which quintiles transnational holdings inc obtained in february 2012 and paid in full in may 2013 the pay down of 500 million of outstanding indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities in may 2013 the mandatory prepayment of 338 million of outstanding indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities in the first quarter of 2013 and the 250 million prepayment of outstanding indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities in december 2014 these repayments more than offset the impact on the average debt outstanding of the 2750 million term loan issued under the receivables financing facility in december 2014 and the 1500 million draw on our line of credit in 2014 which was repaid with the proceeds of the receivables financing facility term loan

 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

 



in may 2015 we recognized a 78 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the refinancing of our senior secured credit facilities the loss on extinguishment of debt included 11 million of unamortized debt issuance costs 13 million of unamortized discount and 54 million of related fees and expenses

in december 2013 we recognized a 33 million loss on extinguishment of debt on a portion of the debt retired related to the refinancing of our senior secured credit facilities the loss on extinguishment of debt included 16 million of unamortized debt issuance costs 16 million of unamortized discount and 25000 of fees and expenses

other expense income net for 2014 included income of approximately 86 million due to changes in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration from an acquisition as well as a gain from the sale of marketable equity securities of approximately 50 million partially offset by other expenses primarily consisting of 49 million of foreign currency net losses

other expense income net for 2013 included income of approximately 35 million due to changes in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration for two of our acquisitions completed in 2011 in addition 2013 included approximately 40 million of foreign currency net losses

income tax expense

 



the decrease in the 2015 effective income tax rate was due to an income tax benefit related to the reversal of uncertain tax positions for tax years whose statute of limitations expired in 2015 and also a change in the relative mix of the profitability between taxing jurisdictions these benefits were partially offset by additional income tax expense related to an increase in the amount of current year earnings of our foreign subsidiaries not considered permanently reinvested

 

the effective income tax rate for 2013 was negatively impacted by the settlement of certain intercompany notes in 2013 that had previously been considered longterm investments which resulted in 111 million of income tax expense this negative impact was primarily offset by our change in asserti on regarding the undistributed earnings of most of our foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states prior to june 2013 we had not considered the majority of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested we reevaluated this assertion following the ipo as a portion of the ipo proceeds were used to pay down debt held in the united states and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future which ha d been significant in the past given our debt balance and related interest expense and the change in approach related to payment of dividends we expect to be able to support the cash needs of our domestic subsidiaries without repatriating cash from the affected foreign subsidiaries we expect to utilize the cash generated outside of the united states to fund growth outside of the united states as a result of the assertion change we recorded an 81 million income tax benefit in the second quarter of 20 13 to reverse the deferred income tax liability previously recorded on undistributed foreign earnings prior to 2013 that are now considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states 

equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates

 



equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates in 2015 primarily included earnings from our investment in novaquest pharma opportunities fund iii lp or fund iii the increase in 2014 when compared to 2013 was primarily due to earnings from fund iii partially offset by losses and writedowns incurred on another equity method investment

net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2015 primarily included quest’s interest in q 2 solutions

segment results of operations

service revenues and income from operations by segment are as follows dollars in millions

 



certain costs are not allocated to our segments and are reported as general corporate and unallocated expenses these costs primarily consist of sharebased compensation and expenses for corporate office functions such as senior leadership finance human resources it facilities and legal as well as certain expenses incurred in the second quarter of 2013 including the 250 million fee incurred in connection with the termination of the management agreement with affiliates of certain shareholders and the 15 million fee paid in connection with the modification of an agreement for the business usage of an airplane owned by gfm we do not allocate restructuring or impairment charges to our segments

the volumerelated service revenue growth was related to core clinical services clinical solutions provided on a functional resource basis and clinical trial support services this growth was due largely to execution on the higher backlog in place as we entered the year in addition we recognized 169 million of revenue in the second quarter of 2015 as a result of the release of deferred revenue upon the early close out of a customer arrangement lower revenues from advisory services were primarily due to lower activity on projects related to regulatory compliance remediation

constant currency service revenue growth during the year ended december 31 2015 was also negatively impacted by cancellations from 2014

2014 compared to 2013

product development’s service revenues were 31 billion in 2014 an increase of 1781 million or 61 over 2013 this increase was comprised of constant currency service revenue growth of 1832 million or 63 offset by a negative impact of approximately 51 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency service revenue growth was primarily a result of a volumerelated increase of 1002 million in clinical solutions and services and 896 million from the novella acquisition which were partially offset by a decrease of 66 from advisory services

the volumerelated service revenue growth from clinical solutions and services was related to an increase in clinical solutions provided on a functional resource basis clinical trial support services and core clinical services in asia and japan this growth was due largely to execution on the higher backlog in place as we entered 2014 the rate of yearoveryear revenue growth was negatively impacted by the winddown of a large clinical solutions project delivered throughout 2013

the constant currency service costs growth was primarily due to the impact from the q 2 solutions transaction and an increase in compensation and related expenses the increase i n compensation and related expenses resulted from an increase in billable headcount as a result of the ramp up of new projects which we expect to continue as well as annual merit increases and an increase in competition for qualified personnel in certain markets  also contributing to the constant currency increase was 172 million of expense recognized in the second quarter of 2015 as a result of the release of deferred contract costs upon the early close out of a customer arrangement service cost growt h was partially offset by an 83 million increase in the benefit from research and development credits received in europe when compared to the same period in the prior year as a percent of service revenues product development’s service costs were 573 and 588 in 2015 and 2014 respectively the decrease in service costs as a percentage of service revenues reflected a favorable impact of 170 basis points from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations and a closer alignment of resources with project requirements including cost efficiencies gained from restructuring actions taken in prior years which more than offset the impact of the constant currency service costs growth noted above

the constant currency service costs growth was due to 1 incremental costs resulting from the novella acquisition 2 an increase in billable headcount and other expenses directly related to our service contracts to support our higher volume of revenue and 3 a reduction of an accrual for statutory profit sharing of approximately 54 million in 2013 as a result of guidance handed down by an administrative court in france these increases in service costs were partially offset by a 106 million increase in the benefit from research and development grants primarily from france and austria as well as efficiencies gained from restructuring activities taken in prior years as a percent of service revenues product development’s service costs were 588 and 600 in 2014 and 2013 respectively the decrease in service costs as a percentage of service revenues was primarily a result of a closer alignment of resources with project requirements including cost efficiencies gained from restructuring actions taken in prior years

liquidity and capital resources

overview

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows in addition to operating cash flows other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include capital expenditures acquisitions investments debt service requirements dividends equity repurchases adequacy of our revolving credit and receivables financing facilities and access to the capital markets

we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which those funds can be accessed on a cost effective basis the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse income tax consequences the earnings of most of our foreign subsidiaries are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the united states which limits our ability to repatriate cash from our foreign subsidiaries for the foreseeable future

we had a cash balance of 9772 million at december 31 2015 2449 million of which was in the united states an increase from 8674 million at december 31 2014

 

based on our current operating plan we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents future cash flows from operations and our ability to access funds under our revolving credit and receivables financing facilities will enable us to fund our operating requirements and capital expenditures and meet debt obligations for at least the next 12 months we regularly evaluate our debt arrangements as well as market conditions  and from time to time we may explore opportunities to modify our exis ting debt arrangements or pursue additional financing arrangements that could result in the issuance of new debt securities by us or our affiliates  we may use our existing cash cash generated from operations or dispositions of assets or businesses andor proceeds from any new financing arrangements or issuances of debt or equity securities to repay or reduce some of our outstanding obligations to repurchase shares from our shareholders or for other purposes as part of our ongoing business strategy we a lso are continually evaluating new acquisition expansion and investment possibilities or other strategic growth opportunities as well as potential dispositions of assets or businesses as appropriate including dispositions that may cause us to recognize a loss on certain assets should we elect to pursue any such transaction we may seek to obtain debt or equity financing to facilitate those activities our ability to enter into any such potential transactions and our use of cash or proceeds is limited t o varying degrees by the terms and restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facilities we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to complete any such financing arrangements or other transactions on favorable terms or at all

cash flow from operating activities

 



2015 compared to 2014 

cash provided by operating activities increased by 439 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 the increase in cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects the increase in net income including adjustments for noncash items necessary to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities also contributing to the increase was an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 585 million as well as lower payments for interest 116 million and income taxes 181 million these improvements in operating cash flow were partially offset by higher cash used in days sales outstanding or dso the higher cash used in dso reflects a sevenday increase in dso in 2015 compared to a twoday increase in dso in 2014 dso can shift significantly at each reporting period depending on the timing of cash receipts under contractual payment terms relative to the recognition of revenue over a project lifecycle

 

2014 compared to 2013 

cash provided by operating activities increased by 384 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 the increase in operating cash flow reflects an increase in net income lower payments for interest 216 million and lower cash used in dso 211 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 this lower cash used in dso reflects a twoday increase in dso in 2014 compared to a fiveday increase in 2013 in addition net income for 2013 included cash expenses totaling 325 million for a fee paid in connection with the termination of our management agreement with affiliates of certain of our shareholders 250 million a fee paid in connection with the modification of an agreement for the business usage of an airplane owned by gfm 15 million and a termination fee for the repayment of the 3000 million term loan 60 million which did not recur in 2014 these increases in operating cash flow were partially offset by higher payments for income taxes 679 million and higher cash used for incentive compensation

cash flow from investing activities

 



2015 compared to 2014 

cash used in investing activities decreased by 1061 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 this decrease was primarily related to cash acquired in the q 2 solutions transaction 317 million compared to cash used for the acquisition of businesses 922 million in 2014 partially offset by the termination of interest rate swaps in connection with the refinancing transaction in 2015 110 million and higher cash used for investments

cash used in investing activities decreased by 631 million to 1731 million in 2014 as compared to 2362 million in 2013 this decline in the use of cash in 2014 was primarily related to lower cash used for the acquisition of businesses cash used to acquire businesses in 2014 was 922 million consisting primarily of the acquisition of encore as compared to 2013 which included the acquisition of novella for approximately 1450 million also contributing to the decline was lower cash used to acquire property equipment and software and an increase in proceeds from the sale of equity securities

contractual obligations and commitments 

below is a summary of our future payment commitments by year under contractual obligations as of december 31 2015 in millions

 



 













subsequent event

in february 2016 our board approved a restructuring plan for approximately 22 million primarily for severance and other exit costs to align our resources and reduce overcapacity some of these actions are subject to certain legal and regulatory requirements we anticipate that these actions if implemented will occur in 2016 and are expected to result in a reduction of approximately 18 million to 20 million of service revenues during the year ended december 31 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015

application of critical accounting policies

note 1 to the consolidated financial statements provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates and related disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes known actual results may differ from those estimates

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied 1 there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement 2 the service offering has been delivered to the customer 3 the collection of fees is probable and 4 the arrangement consideration is fixed or determinable we do not recognize revenue with respect to startup activities including contract and scope negotiation feasibility analysis and conflict of interest review associated with contracts the costs for these activities are expensed as incurred for contracts in which portions of revenue are contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future events we recognize the revenue only after it has been earned and the contingency has been resolved

the majority of our revenue is recognized based on objective contractual criteria and does not require significant estimates or judgments however at any point in time we are working on thousands of active customer projects which are governed by individual contracts most projects are customized based on the needs of the customer the type of services being provided therapeutic indication of the drug geographic locations and other variables project specific terms related to pricing billing terms and the scope and type of services to be provided are generally negotiated and contracted on a projectbyproject basis changes in the scope of work are common especially under longterm contracts and generally result in a change in contract value in such situations we enter into negotiations for a contract amendment to reflect the change in scope and the related price depending on the complexity of the amendment the negotiation process can take from a few weeks for a simple adjustment to several months for a complex amendment management may authorize the project team to commence work on activities outside the contract scope while we negotiate and finalize the contract amendment in these limited cases if we are not able to obtain a contract amendment from the customer our profit margin on the arrangement may be impacted this result occurs because our costs of delivery are expensed as they are incurred while revenue is not recognized unless the customer has agreed to the changes in scope and renegotiated pricing terms the contract value is amended and all other revenue recognition criteria are met

for arrangements that include multiple elements arrangement consideration is allocated to units of accounting based on the relative selling price the best evidence of selling price of a unit of accounting is vendorspecific objective evidence or vsoe which is the price we charge when the deliverable is sold separately when vsoe is not available to determine selling price we use relevant thirdparty evidence or tpe of selling price if available when neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists we use our best estimate of selling price considering all relevant information that is available without undue cost and effort

most contracts are terminable upon 30 to 90 days notice by the customer our risk of material loss in these situations is mitigated as these contracts generally require payment to us for expenses to wind down the clinical trial or project fees earned to date and in some cases a termination fee or a payment of some portion of the fees or profits that could have been earned under the contract if it had not been terminated early in addition our contract terms provide for payment terms that generally correspond with performance of the services termination fees are included in service revenues when realization is assured

accounts receivable and unbilled services

accounts receivable represents amounts billed to customers revenues recognized in excess of billings are classified as unbilled services the realization of these amounts is based on the customer’s willingness and ability to pay us we have an allowance for doubtful accounts based on management’s estimate of probable losses we expect to incur resulting from a customer failing to pay us our allowance for doubtful accounts and losses from customers failing to pay us have not been material to our results of operations if any of these estimates change or actual results differs from expected results then an adjustment is recorded in the period in which the amounts become reasonably estimable these adjustments could have a material effect on our results of operations

investments in unconsolidated affiliates — equity method investments

we have investments in unconsolidated affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting periodically we review our investments for a decline in value which we believe may be other than temporary should we identify such a decline we will record a loss through earnings to establish a new cost basis for the investment these losses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

 

inc ome taxes 

certain items of income and expense are not recognized on our income tax returns and financial statements in the same year which creates timing differences the income tax effect of these timing differences results in 1 deferred income tax assets that create a reduction in future income taxes and 2 deferred income tax liabilities that create an increase in future income taxes recognition of deferred income tax assets is based on management’s belief that it is more likely than not that the income tax benefit associated with certain temporary differences income tax operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and income tax credits would be realized we recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets for those deferred income tax items for which it was more likely than not that realization would not occur we determined the amount of the valuation allowance based in part on our assessment of future taxable income and in light of our ongoing income tax strategies if our estimate of future taxable income or tax strategies changes at any time in the future we would record an adjustment to our valuation allowance recording such an adjustment could have a material effect on our financial position

income tax expense is based on the distribution of profit before income tax among the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate adjusted as required by the income tax laws of each taxing jurisdiction changes in the distribution of profits and losses among taxing jurisdictions may have a significant impact on our effective income tax rate we consider the undistributed earnings of most of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states accordingly we have not provided a deferred income tax liability related to those undistributed earnings

business combinations

we use the acquisition method to account for business combinations and accordingly the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recorded at their estimated fair values on the date of the acquisition we use significant judgments estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest including expected future cash flows discount rates that reflect the risk associated with the expected future cash flows and estimated useful lives

when a business combination involves contingent consideration we recognize a liability equal to the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the date of the acquisition the estimate of fair value of a contingent consideration liability requires subjective assumptions to be made regarding future business results including revenues and net new business discount rates that reflect the risk associated with the expected future cash flows and probabilities assigned to various potential business result scenarios we periodically reassess the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration over the term of the arrangement any resulting changes are recognized in earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations

goodwill tangible and identifiable intangible assets

we have recorded and allocated to our reporting units the excess of the cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired known as goodwill the recoverability of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated annually for impairment or if and when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized we review the carrying values of other identifiable intangible assets if the facts and circumstances indicate a possible impairment based upon our 2015 annual testing we believe that the risk of an impairment to goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets is currently very low except for the encore reporting unit while we have concluded at this time that it is more likely than not that there is no impairment in the encore reporting unit and concluded that a quantitative analysis was not necessary if certain strategic initiatives do not perform as expected during 2016 a quantitative analysis may be required other identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives

for goodwill we perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its book value this includes a qualitative analysis of macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations internal cost factors financial performance fair value history and other company specific events if this qualitative analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that estimated fair value is less than the book value for the respective reporting unit we apply a twostep impairment test in which we determine whether the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of its carrying value if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied estimated fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill we determine the implied estimated fair value of goodwill by determining the present value of the estimated future cash flows for each reporting unit and comparing the reporting unit’s risk profile and growth prospects to selected reasonably similar publicly traded companies the inherent subjectivity of applying a discounted cash flow and market comparables approach to valuing our assets and liabilities could have a significant impact on our analysis any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

 

for indefinitelived intangible assets we perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value if this qualitative ana lysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset we determine the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset trade name by determini ng the present value of the estimated royalty payments on an aftertax basis that it would be required to pay the owner for the right to use such trade name if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an am ount equal to the excess any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we review the carrying values of property and equipment if the facts and circumstances suggest that a potential impairment may have occurred if this review indicates that carrying values will not be recoverable as determined based on undiscounted cash flows over the remaining depreciation or amortization period we will reduce carrying values to estimated fair value the inherent subjectivity of our estimates of future cash flows could have a significant impact on our analysis any future writeoffs of longlived assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

sharebased compensation

we measure compensation cost for most sharebased payment awards stock options and stock appreciation rights granted to employees and nonemployee directors at fair value using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model sharebased compensation expense includes sharebased awards granted to employees and nonemployee directors and has been reported in selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income based upon the classification of the individuals who were granted sharebased awards

the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions including share price volatility the expected life of the award riskfree interest rate and the fair value of the underlying common shares on the date of grant in developing our assumptions we take into account the following











 

 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitat ive disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and other relevant market rate or price changes in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to various market risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and we regularly evaluate our exposure to such changes our overall risk management strategy seeks to balance the magnitude of the exposure and the cost and availability of appropriate financial instruments from time to time we have utilized forward exchange contracts to manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk the following analyses present the sensitivity of our financial instruments to hypothetical changes in rates that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period

foreign currency exchange rates

approximately 32 and 38 of our service revenues for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively were denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar our financial statements are reported in united states dollars and accordingly fluctuations in exchange rates will affect the translation of our revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies into united states dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results in 2015 and 2014 the most significant currency exchange rate exposures were the euro british pound singapore dollar indian rupee and japanese yen excluding the impacts from any outstanding or future hedging transactions a hypothetical change of 10 in average exchange rates used to translate all foreign currencies to united states dollars would have impacted income before income taxes for 2015 by approximately 454 million accumulated currency translation adjustments recorded as a separate component of shareholders’ deficit were 1168 million and 557 million at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively we do not have significant operations in countries in which the economy is considered to be highlyinflationary

we are subject to foreign currency transaction risk for fluctuations in exchange rates during the period of time between the consummation and cash settlement of a transaction we earn revenue from our service contracts over a period of several months and in some cases over a period of several years accordingly exchange rate fluctuations during this period may affect our profitability with respect to such contracts we limit our foreign currency transaction risk through exchange rate fluctuation provisions stated in our contracts with customers or we may hedge our transaction risk with foreign currency exchange contracts at december 31 2015 we had 15 open foreign exchange forward contracts relating to service contracts with various amounts maturing monthly through september 2016 with a notional value totaling approximately 1175 million at december 31 2014 we had 13 open foreign exchange forward contracts relating to service contracts with various amounts maturing monthly through september 2015 with a notional value totaling approximately 760 million

interest rates

because we have variable rate debt fluctuations in interest rates affect our business we attempt to minimize interest rate risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps we have entered into interest rate swaps with financial institutions that have reset dates and critical terms that match those of our senior secured term loan credit facility accordingly any change in market value associated with the interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt as of december 31 2015 we had approximately 17 billion of variable rate indebtedness in june 2015 we entered into seven forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional value of 4400 million which will be effective june 30 2016 at which time we will have approximately 12 billion of variable rate indebtedness the interest rate swaps expire between march 31 2017 and march 31 2020 because we do not attempt to hedge all of our variable rate debt we may incur higher interest costs for the portion of our variable rate debt which is not hedged once the interest rate swaps are effective each quarterpoint increase or decrease in the variable interest rate would result in our interest expense changing by approximately 31 million per year under our unhedged variable rate debt

 item 1 business 

overview 

we are the world’s largest provider of biopharmaceutical development services and commercial outsourcing services we are positioned at the intersection of business services and healthcare and generated 42 billion of service revenues in 2014 conduct business in approximately 100 countries and have approximately 32600 employees we use the breadth and depth of our service offerings our global footprint and our therapeutic scientific and analytics expertise to help our biopharmaceutical customers as well as other healthcare customers to be more successful in an increasingly complex healthcare environment 

since our founding in 1982 we have grown to become a leader in the development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical therapies our product development segment is the world’s largest contract research organization or cro based upon the most recently available public information of reported service revenues and is focused primarily on phase iiiv clinical trials and associated laboratory and analytical activities our integrated healthcare services segment includes one of the leading global commercial pharmaceutical sales and service organizations integrated healthcare services provides a broad array of services including commercial services such as contract pharmaceutical sales forces and healthcare business services for the broader healthcare sector such as realworld and late phase research market access and consulting health information analytics and technology consulting and other healthcare solutions product development contributed approximately 74 and integrated healthcare services contributed approximately 26 to our 2014 service revenues additional information regarding our segments is presented in note 20 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

our global scale and capabilities enable us to work with the leading companies in the biopharmaceutical sector during each of the last 12 years we have worked with the 20 largest biopharmaceutical companies ranked by 2013 reported revenues we have provided services in connection with the development or commercialization of the top 100 bestselling biopharmaceutical products and the top 50 bestselling biologic products from 2013 as measured by reported sales of the new molecular entities or nmes and new biological license applications or blas approved by the united states food and drug administration or fda from 2004 through 2013 we helped develop or commercialize 100 of the central nervous system drugs 92 of the oncology drugs and 87 of the cardiovascular drugs 

in 2014 our service revenues were 42 billion and our net income attributable to our shareholders was 3564 million in addition our 2014 net new business was 56 billion and we ended the year with 112 billion in backlog our backlog is diversified with 37 from top 10 biopharmaceutical companies 22 representing contracts with biopharmaceutical companies ranked as 1120 19 representing contracts with biopharmaceutical companies ranked as 2150 and 22 representing contracts with biopharmaceutical companies outside the top 50 in each case as ranked by 2013 sales see part i item 1 “business—net new business reporting and backlog” for more detail during each of the last seven years we have had at least eight customers from whom we earned more than 100 million in service revenues no single customer represented more than 10 of our 2014 revenues 

our markets 

the market served by product development consists primarily of biopharmaceutical companies including medical device and diagnostics companies that outsource services associated with the development of pharmaceutical products such as clinical trials we estimate that total research and development or rd spending was approximately 140 billion in 2014 of which biopharmaceutical spending on drug development was approximately 95 billion and we estimate that our addressable market clinical development spending excluding preclinical spending was approximately 52 billion the portion of this 52 billion that was outsourced in 2014 based on our estimates was approximately 21 billion we estimate that the potential market for product development’s services will experience a compound annual growth rate or cagr of 68 from 2014 through 2017 as a result of increased rd spending by biopharmaceutical companies and the increased outsourcing of this spending as compared to 2013 

 

integrated healthcare services primarily addresses markets related to the use of approved biopharmaceutical products we estimate that total spending related to approved drugs including biopharmaceutical spending on commercialization of these drugs and expenditures by participants in the broader healthcare market on realworld research healthcare technology implementation analytics and evidencebased medicine exceeded 98 billion in 2014 integrated healthcare services links product development to healthcare delivery this segment’s services include commercial services such as recruiting training deploying and managing a global sales force channel management patient engagement services market access consulting brand communication consulting and health information analytics and technology consulting in addition integrated healthcare services offers realworld late phase services such as observational studies comparative effectiveness studies and product and disease registry services which are intended to help increase the quality and costeffectiveness of healthcare and payer provider solutions we believe that a combination of cost pressure in healthcare systems around the world and the increasing focus on the value and efficacy of pharmaceutical therapy provide us many opportunities to grow our revenues and expand our service offerings by improving the costeffectiveness of drug therapies 

we believe that we are wellpositioned to benefit from current trends in the biopharmaceutical and healthcare industries that affect our markets including 

trends in rd spending we estimate that rd spending was approximately 140 billion in 2014 and will grow to approximately 150 billion in 2017 with drug development accounting for approximately 68 of total expenditures rd spending trends are impacted as a result of several factors including major biopharmaceutical companies’ efforts to replenish revenues lost from the socalled “patent cliff” of recent years increased access to capital by the small and midcap biotechnology industry and recent increases in pharmaceutical approvals by regulatory authorities in 2014 there were approximately 4620 drugs in the phase iiii development pipeline an increase of 35 since 2008 and there were 41 nme approvals by the fda in 2014 which was the highest number of approvals in any of the past 18 years we believe that further rd spending combined with the continued need for cost efficiency across the healthcare landscape will continue to create opportunities for biopharmaceutical services companies particularly those with a global reach and broad service offerings to help biopharmaceutical companies with their pre and postlaunch product development and commercialization needs 

growth in outsourcing we estimate that clinical development spending outsourced to cros in phases iiv in 2014 was approximately 21 billion and will grow to approximately 26 billion by 2017 we expect outsourced clinical development to cros to grow 68 annually during this period of this annual growth we believe that up to 2 will be derived from increased rd expenditures with the remainder coming from increased outsourcing penetration we estimate that overall outsourcing penetration in 2014 was 39 the market served by integrated healthcare services is diverse which makes it difficult to estimate the current amount of outsourced integrated healthcare services and the expected growth in such services however based on our knowledge of these markets we believe that while the rate of outsourcing penetration varies by market within integrated healthcare services the current outsourcing penetration of the estimated 98 billion addressable market is approximately 23 as business models continue to evolve in the healthcare sector we believe that the growth rate for outsourcing across the integrated healthcare services markets will be similar to the growth in clinical development 

we believe that we are well positioned for the future evolution of the healthcare sector as increasing demand from governments and other payers around the world for quality accountability and value for money drive biopharmaceutical companies providers and other healthcare organizations to transform their value chain away from a vertically integrated model to one that is more focused on their core competencies in particular we believe that the following trends will result in increased outsourcing to global biopharmaceutical services companies

customers and marketing 

to provide and coordinate service offerings to our customers we have business development efforts across our service offerings and within many individual service offerings and we also maintain an integrated business development group to foster accountability in key service offering areas each offering area has a designated leader who drives the financial contribution of that offering area these two axes of business development direct the selling and business development personnel in each of our major locations in the united states and throughout europe asia japan canada and latin america providing coverage of both multinational and regionaldomestic biopharmaceutical companies 

we take a holistic customeroriented view toward business development our integrated business development group is responsible for assessing our customers’ current and future needs and helping to define the right service offerings to be delivered at the right time this group includes dedicated customer teams that deliver customized solutions from the full breadth and depth of our service offerings for the world’s leading biopharmaceutical companies in addition we continue to evolve our relationships with our small midsize and other biopharmaceutical customers outside the 20 largest biopharmaceutical companies based on 2013 reported revenues 

in 2014 we earned service revenues of over 100 million each in seven countries in north america europe and asia please refer to note 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further details regarding our foreign and domestic operations in 2014 2013 and 

 

2012 for a discussion of risks attendant to our foreign operations see “risk factors—our business is subject to international economic political and other risks that could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition” 

our service revenues were attributed to our segments as follows 

 

 additional information regarding our segments is presented in note 20 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated service revenues in 2014 2013 or 2012 in the past we have derived and may in the future derive a significant portion of our service revenues from a relatively limited number of major projects or customers as biopharmaceutical companies continue to outsource large projects andor functions to fewer providers this concentration of business could increase 

competition 

the market for our product development services is highly competitive and we compete against traditional cros the inhouse rd departments of biopharmaceutical companies universities and teaching hospitals among the traditional cros there are severalhundred small limitedservice providers several mediumsized firms and only a few fullservice companies with global capabilities consolidation among cros likely will result in greater competition among the larger cros for customers clinical personnel and acquisition candidates product development’s primary competitors include pharmaceutical product development inc parexel international corporation icon plc inventiv health inc or inventiv inc research pra international and covance inc which has entered into a merger agreement with laboratory corporation of america holdings or labcorp that is expected to close in february 2015 among others competitive factors for product development services include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

integrated healthcare services competes in the postapproval and commercialization arenas in the postapproval arena our solutions compete against realworld and late phase research providers including boutique firms divisions of biopharmaceutical companies and divisions of traditional cro’s noted above our commercial solutions compete against the inhouse sales and marketing departments of biopharmaceutical companies other contract pharmaceutical sales and service organizations and consulting firms integrated healthcare services’ primary commercial competitors in the united states include inventiv pdi inc and publicis selling solutions outside of the united states integrated healthcare services commercial teams typically compete against single country or more regionally focused commercial service providers such as united drug plc inventiv eps corporation and cmic holdings co ltd in japan the primary competitive factors affecting integrated healthcare services are breadth of service offering and ability to deploy in an integrated manner quality and track record ie the proven ability to quickly assemble train and manage large qualified commercial teams on a global footprint and price 

notwithstanding these competitive factors we believe that the synergies arising from integrating product development services with commercial services supported by global operations data analysis and the ability to form long term strategic alliances with biopharmaceutical companies differentiate us from our competitors 

government regulation 

good clinical practice 

gcp regulations and guidelines contain the industry standards for the conduct of clinical trials with respect to the integrity of the data and safety of the research subjects the fda the european medicines agency or ema japan’s ministry of health labour and welfare and many other regulatory authorities require that study results and data submitted to such authorities be based on trials conducted in accordance with gcp provisions records for clinical trials must be maintained for specified periods for inspection by the fda and other regulators significant noncompliance with gcp requirements can result in the disqualification by regulators of data collected during the clinical trial 

our standard operating procedures related to clinical trials are written in accordance with regulations and guidelines appropriate to the region where they are used thus helping to ensure compliance with gcp fda regulations and guidelines serve as a basis for our north american standard operating procedures within europe we perform our work subject to the ema’s note for guidance “good clinical practice for trials on medicinal products in the european community” all clinical trials other than those defined as noninterventional to be submitted to the ema must meet the requirements of the ich’s gcp standards our offices in asia and in latin america have developed standard operating procedures in accordance with their local requirements and in harmony with our north american and european operations 

regulation of drugs biologics and medical devices 

in the united states pharmaceutical biological and medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by the fda the federal food drug and cosmetic act or the fdc act the public health service act or the phs act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern among other things the research development testing manufacture storage recordkeeping approval labeling promotion and marketing distribution postapproval monitoring and reporting sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical biological and medical device products failure to comply with applicable united states requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions such as fda refusal to approve a pending nda for a new drug a bla for a new biological product or pma or clearance for a new medical device warning or untitled letters product recalls product seizures total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions fines civil penalties and criminal prosecution 

 

before a new drug or biologic may be marketed it must undergo extensive testing and regulatory review to determine that it is safe and effective and be approved by the fda or other regulatory authority even after approval a new pma or pma supplement may be required in the event of a modification to the device its labeling or its manufacturing process 

regulation of patient information 

our information management services relate to the diagnosis and treatment of disease and are therefore subject to substantial governmental regulation in addition the confidentiality of patientspecific information and the circumstances under which such patientspecific records may be released for inclusion in our databases or used in other aspects of our business is heavily regulated federal state and foreign governments are contemplating or have proposed or adopted additional legislation governing the possession use and dissemination of personal data such as personal health information and personal financial data as well as security breach notification rules for loss or theft of such data additional legislation or regulation of this type might among other things require us to implement new security measures and processes or bring within the legislation or regulation deidentified health or other personal data each of which may require substantial expenditures or limit our ability to offer some of our services 

in particular personal healthrelated information is recognized in many countries such as the united states the european union and several countries in asia as a special sensitive category of personal information subject to additional mandatory protections violations of data protection regulations are subject to administrative penalties civil money penalties and criminal prosecution including corporate fines and personal liability 

in order to comply with these evolving laws and regulations we may need to implement new data protection privacy and data security measures which may require us to make substantial expenditures or cause us to discontinue or limit the products and services we offer in addition if we violate applicable laws regulations contractual commitments or other duties relating to the use privacy or security of health information we could be subject to regulatory sanctions civil liability or criminal prosecution or suffer reputational harm and it may be necessary to modify our business practices 

regulation of promotion marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products and medical devices 

our integrated healthcare services are subject to detailed and comprehensive regulation in each geographic market in which we operate such regulation relates among other things to the distribution of drug samples the marketing and promotion of approved products the qualifications of sales representatives and the use of healthcare professionals in sales functions 

in the united states our integrated healthcare services are subject to numerous federal and state laws pertaining to promotional activities involving pharmaceutical products and medical devices such as the fda’s regulations against “offlabel promotion” which require sales representatives to restrict promotion of the approved product they are detailing to the approved labeling for the product and the prescription drug marketing act which imposes licensing personnel record keeping packaging labeling product handling and facility storage and security requirements other federal and state laws prohibit manufacturers suppliers and providers from offering giving or receiving kickbacks or other remuneration in connection with ordering or recommending the purchase or rental of healthcare items and services the sale or distribution of pharmaceutical products and devices is also governed by the united states federal trade commission act and state consumer protection laws we are subject to similar regulations currently in effect in the other countries where we offer integrated healthcare services 

we are also subject to various laws and regulations that may apply to certain drug and device promotional practices including among others various aspects of the medicare program violations of these laws and regulations may result in criminal andor civil penalties including possibly as an “aider and abettor” 

 

regulation of laboratories 

our united states laboratories are subject to licensing and regulation under federal state and local laws relating to hazard communication and employee righttoknow regulations and the safety and health of laboratory employees additionally our united states laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations and licensing requirements relating to the handling storage and disposal of hazardous waste radioactive materials and laboratory specimens including the regulations of the environmental protection agency the nuclear regulatory commission the department of transportation the national fire protection agency and the united states drug enforcement administration or dea the use of controlled substances in testing for drugs with a potential for abuse is regulated in the united states by the dea and by similar regulatory bodies in other parts of the world our united states laboratories using controlled substances for testing purposes are licensed by the dea the regulations of the united states department of transportation public health service and postal service apply to the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens our laboratories also are subject to international air transport association regulations which govern international shipments of laboratory specimens furthermore when the materials are sent to a foreign country the transportation of such materials becomes subject to the laws rules and regulations of such foreign country our laboratories outside the united states are subject to applicable national laws governing matters such as licensing the handling and disposal of medical specimens hazardous waste and radioactive materials as well as the health and safety of laboratory employees 

in addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace the united states occupational safety and health administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers may be exposed to bloodborne pathogens such as hiv and the hepatitis b virus although we believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with such federal state and local laws failure to comply with such laws could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business fines criminal penalties and other enforcement actions 

further laboratories that analyze human blood or other biological samples for the diagnosis and treatment of clinical trial subjects must comply with clia as well as requirements established by various states the failure to meet these requirements may result in civil penalties and suspension or revocation of the clia certification 

intellectual property 

we develop and use a number of proprietary methodologies analytics systems technologies and other intellectual property in the conduct of our business we rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies nondisclosure agreements invention assignments and other contractual arrangements to protect our trade secrets and patent copyright and trademark laws to protect other intellectual property rights we have also registered or applied for trademarks and service marks in the united states and a number of foreign countries and our trademark “quintiles ® ” is of material importance to us although the duration of trademark and service mark registrations varies from country to country trademarks and service marks generally may be renewed indefinitely so long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained and so long as they have not been found to have become generic although we believe the ownership of our patents trademarks and service marks is an important factor in our business and that our success does depend in part on the ownership thereof we rely primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of our employees other than our quintiles ® trademark we do not have any material patents trademarks service marks licenses franchises or concessions 

net new business reporting and backlog 

net new business is the expected service revenues awarded during the period from projects under signed contracts letters of intent and in some cases written precontract commitments and adjustments on contracts modified or canceled during the period net new business under sole provider arrangements is recorded over the life of the arrangement as projects are awarded 

 

consistent with our methodology for calculating net new business during a particular period backlog represents at a particular point in time future service revenues from work not yet completed or performed under signed contracts letters of intent and in some cases precontract commitments that are supported by written communications once work begins on a project service revenues are recognized over the duration of the project included within backlog at december 31 2014 is approximately 7593 million of backlog that we do not expect to generate revenue in the next 12 months 

backlog was as follows 

 

 net new business was as follows 

 

 we believe that backlog and net new business may not be consistent indicators of future revenues because they have been and likely will be affected by a number of factors including the variable size and duration of projects many of which are performed over several years cancellations and changes to the scope of work during the course of projects projects that have been delayed remain in backlog but the timing of the revenue generated may differ from the timing originally expected additionally projects may be terminated or delayed by the customer or delayed by regulatory authorities if a customer cancels an order we may be reimbursed for the costs we have incurred however we typically do not have a contractual right to the full amount of the revenue reflected in our backlog or net new business contracts in the event of cancellation for more details regarding risks related to our backlog see “risk factors—the relationship of backlog to revenues varies over time” 

employees 

as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 32600 fulltime equivalent employees in approximately 60 countries comprised approximately of 12300 in the americas region 10100 in the europe and africa region and 10200 in the asiapacific region with at least 500 employees in 10 countries around the world as of december 31 2014 product development and integrated healthcare services had approximately 21400 and 9500 fulltime equivalent employees respectively in addition our centralized operationscorporate office had approximately 1700 fulltime equivalent employees 

the success of our business depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified professional scientific and technical staff the level of competition among employers in the united states and overseas for skilled personnel particularly those with phd md or equivalent degrees or training is high we believe that our brand recognition and our multinational presence are an advantage in attracting qualified candidates in addition we believe that the wide range of clinical trials in which we participate allows us to offer broad experience to clinical researchers none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union employees in some of our nonunited states locations are represented by works councils as required by local laws we believe that our relations with our employees are good

 item 1a risk factors 

risk factors 

we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks some of which are beyond our control you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below together with the other information included in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating our company the occurrence of any of the following risks may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects 

risks relating to our business 

the potential loss or delay of our large contracts or of multiple contracts could adversely affect our results 

most of our customers can terminate our contracts upon 30 to 90 days notice our customers may delay terminate or reduce the scope of our contracts for a variety of reasons beyond our control including but not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result contract terminations delays and alterations are a regular part of our business in the event of termination our contracts often provide for fees for winding down the project but these fees may not be sufficient for us to maintain our margins and termination may result in lower resource utilization rates in addition we may not realize the full benefits of our backlog of contractually committed services if our customers cancel delay or reduce their commitments under our contracts with them which may occur if among other things a customer decides to shift its business to a competitor or revoke our status as a preferred provider thus the loss or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could adversely affect our service revenues and profitability we believe the risk of loss or delay of multiple contracts potentially has greater effect where we are party to broader partnering arrangements with global biopharmaceutical companies 

our financial results may be adversely affected if we underprice our contracts overrun our cost estimates or fail to receive approval for or experience delays in documenting change orders 

most of our contracts are either fee for service contracts or fixedfee contracts our past financial results have been and our future financial results may be adversely impacted if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates and are unable to successfully negotiate a change order change orders typically occur when the scope of work we perform needs to be modified from that originally contemplated by 

 

our contract with the customer modifications can occur for example when there is a change in a key trial assumption or parameter or a significant change in timing where we are not successful in converting outofscope work into change orders under our current contracts we bear the cost of the additional work such underpricing significant cost overruns or delay in documentation of change orders could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

the relationship of backlog to revenues varies over time 

backlog represents future service revenues from work not yet completed or performed under signed contracts letters of intent and in some cases written precontract commitments once work begins on a project revenue is recognized over the duration of the project projects may be terminated or delayed by the customer or delayed by regulatory authorities for reasons beyond our control to the extent projects are delayed the timing of our revenue could be affected in the event that a customer cancels a contract we typically would be entitled to receive payment for all services performed up to the cancellation date and subsequent customerauthorized services related to terminating the canceled project typically however we have no contractual right to the full amount of the revenue reflected in our backlog in the event of a contract cancellation the duration of the projects included in our backlog and the related revenue recognition range from a few weeks to many years our backlog may not be indicative of our future revenues and we may not realize all the anticipated future revenue reflected in our backlog a number of factors may affect backlog including 

 

  

  

 our backlog at december 31 2014 was 11244 million compared to backlog of 9855 million at december 31 2013 although an increase in backlog will generally result in an increase in revenues to be recognized over time depending on the level of cancellations an increase in backlog at a particular point in time does not necessarily correspond directly to an increase in revenues during a particular period the extent to which contracts in backlog will result in revenue depends on many factors including but not limited to delivery against projected schedules the need for scope changes change orders contract cancellations and the nature duration size complexity and phase of the contracts each of which factors can vary significantly from time to time our 11244 million of backlog at december 31 2014 included approximately 7593 million of backlog that we do not expect to generate revenue in 2015 as compared to our 9855 million of backlog at december 31 2013 which included approximately 6342 million of backlog that we did not expect to generate revenue in 2014 

the rate at which our backlog converts to revenue may vary over time for a variety of reasons the revenue recognition on larger more global projects could be slower than on smaller less global projects for a variety of reasons including but not limited to an extended period of negotiation between the time the project is awarded to us and the actual execution of the contract as well as an increased timeframe for obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals additionally the increased complexity of trials and the need to enroll precise patient populations could extend the length of trials causing revenue to be recognized over a longer period of time further delayed projects will remain in backlog unless otherwise canceled by the customer and will not generate revenue at the rate originally expected thus the relationship of backlog to realized revenues may vary over time 

our business depends on the continued effectiveness and availability of our information systems including the information systems we use to provide our services to our customers and failures of these systems may materially limit our operations 

due to the global nature of our business and our reliance on information systems to provide our services we intend to increase our use of webenabled and other integrated information systems in delivering our services we also provide access to similar information systems to certain of our customers in connection with the services 

 

we provide them as the breadth and complexity of our information systems continue to grow we will increasingly be exposed to the risks inherent in the development integration and ongoing operation of evolving information systems including 

 

  

  

 the materialization of any of these risks may impede the processing of data the delivery of databases and services and the daytoday management of our business and could result in the corruption loss or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary confidential or other data while we have disaster recovery plans in place they might not adequately protect us in the event of a system failure despite any precautions we take damage from fire floods hurricanes power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses breakins and similar events at our various computer facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to our servers and from our servers to our customers corruption or loss of data may result in the need to repeat a trial at no cost to the customer but at significant cost to us the termination of a contract or damage to our reputation additionally significant delays in system enhancements or inadequate performance of new or upgraded systems once completed could damage our reputation and harm our business finally longterm disruptions in the infrastructure caused by events such as natural disasters the outbreak of war the escalation of hostilities and acts of terrorism particularly involving cities in which we have offices could adversely affect our businesses although we carry property and business interruption insurance our coverage might not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur 

unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential data whether through systems failure or employee negligence fraud or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers similarly we have been and expect that we will continue to be subject to attempts to gain unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our customers whether by our employees or third parties including a cyber attack by computer programmers and hackers who may develop and deploy viruses worms or other malicious software programs to date these attacks have not had a material impact on our operations or financial results nonetheless successful attacks in the future could result in negative publicity significant remediation costs legal liability and damage to our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition our liability insurance might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches cyber attacks and other related breaches 

we may be adversely affected by customer or therapeutic concentration 

although we did not have any customer that represented 10 or more of our service revenues in 2014 2013 or 2012 we derive the majority of our revenues from a number of large customers if any large customer decreases or terminates its relationship with us our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

additionally conducting multiple clinical trials for different customers in a single therapeutic class involving drugs with the same or similar chemical action has in the past and may in the future adversely affect our business if some or all of the trials are canceled because of new scientific information or regulatory judgments that affect the drugs as a class or if industry consolidation results in the rationalization of drug development pipelines similarly marketing and selling drugs for different biopharmaceutical companies with similar chemical actions subjects us to risk if new scientific information or regulatory judgment prejudices the drugs as a class which may lead to compelled or voluntary prescription limitations or withdrawal of some or all of such drugs from the market 

 

our business is subject to international economic political and other risks that could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we have significant operations in foreign countries that may require complex arrangements to deliver services on global contracts for our customers additionally we have established operations in locations remote from our most developed business centers as a result we are subject to heightened risks inherent in conducting business internationally including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these risks and uncertainties could negatively impact our ability to among other things perform large global projects for our customers furthermore our ability to deal with these issues could be affected by applicable united states laws and the need to protect our assets any such risks could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

due to the global nature of our business we may be exposed to liabilities under the united states foreign corrupt practices act and various nonus anticorruption laws and any allegation or determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are required to comply with the united states foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa and other us and nonus anticorruption laws which prohibit companies from engaging in bribery including corruptly or improperly offering promising or providing money or anything else of value to nonus officials and certain other recipients in addition the fcpa imposes certain books records and accounting control obligations on public companies and other issuers we operate in parts of the world in which corruption can be common and compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices our global operations face the risk of unauthorized payments or offers being made by employees consultants sales agents and other business partners outside of our control or without our authorization it is our policy to implement safeguards to prohibit these practices by our employees and business partners with respect to our operations however irrespective of these safeguards or as a result of monitoring compliance with such safeguards it is possible that we or certain 

 

other parties may discover or receive information at some point that certain employees consultants sales agents or other business partners may have engaged in corrupt conduct for which we might be held responsible violations of the fcpa or other nonus anticorruption laws may result in restatements of or irregularities in our financial statements as well as severe criminal or civil sanctions and we may be subject to other liabilities which could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition in some cases companies that violate the fcpa may be debarred by the us government andor lose their us export privileges changes in anticorruption laws or enforcement priorities could also result in increased compliance requirements and related costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition the us or other governments may seek to hold us liable for successor liability fcpa violations or violations of other anticorruption laws committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquired or will acquire 

if we are unable to successfully develop and market new services or enter new markets our growth results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

a key element of our growth strategy is the successful development and marketing of new services or entering new markets that complement or expand our existing business as we develop new services or enter new markets including services targeted at participants in the broader healthcare industry we may not have or adequately build the competencies necessary to perform such services satisfactorily may not receive market acceptance for such services or may face increased competition if we are unable to succeed in developing new services entering new markets or attracting a customer base for our new services or in new markets we will be unable to implement this element of our growth strategy and our future business reputation results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

upgrading the information systems that support our operating processes and evolving the technology platform for our services pose risks to our business 

continued efficient operation of our business requires that we implement standardized global business processes and evolve our information systems to enable this implementation we have continued to undertake significant programs to optimize business processes with respect to our services our inability to effectively manage the implementation and adapt to new processes designed into these new or upgraded systems in a timely and costeffective manner may result in disruption to our business and negatively affect our operations 

we have entered into agreements with certain vendors to provide systems development and integration services that develop or license to us the it platform for programs to optimize our business processes if such vendors fail to perform as required or if there are substantial delays in developing implementing and updating the it platform our customer delivery may be impaired and we may have to make substantial further investments internally or with third parties to achieve our objectives additionally our progress may be limited by parties with existing or claimed patents who seek to enjoin us from using preferred technology or seek license payments from us 

meeting our objectives is dependent on a number of factors which may not take place as we anticipate including obtaining adequate technologyenabled services creating itenabled services that our customers will find desirable and implementing our business model with respect to these services also increased itrelated expenditures may negatively impact our profitability 

if we fail to perform our services in accordance with contractual requirements regulatory standards and ethical considerations we could be subject to significant costs or liability and our reputation could be harmed 

we contract with biopharmaceutical companies to perform a wide range of services to assist them in bringing new drugs to market our services include monitoring clinical trials data and laboratory analysis edc patient recruitment and other related services such services are complex and subject to contractual requirements regulatory standards and ethical considerations for example we must adhere to regulatory requirements such as the fda and current gcp glp and gmp requirements if we fail to perform our services in accordance with 

 

these requirements regulatory agencies may take action against us for failure to comply with applicable regulations governing clinical trials or sales and marketing practices such actions may include sanctions such as injunctions or failure of such regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of products delay suspension or withdrawal of approvals license revocation product seizures or recalls operational restrictions civil or criminal penalties or prosecutions damages or fines customers may also bring claims against us for breach of our contractual obligations and patients in the clinical trials and patients taking drugs approved on the basis of those trials may bring personal injury claims against us for negligence any such action could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and reputation 

such consequences could arise if among other things the following occur 

improper performance of our services the performance of clinical development services is complex and timeconsuming for example we may make mistakes in conducting a clinical trial that could negatively impact or obviate the usefulness of the trial or cause the results of the trial to be reported improperly if the trial results are compromised we could be subject to significant costs or liability which could have an adverse impact on our ability to perform our services as examples 

 

  

  

 large clinical trials can cost hundreds of millions of dollars and while we endeavor to contractually limit our exposure to such risks improper performance of our services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition damage our reputation and result in the cancellation of current contracts by or failure to obtain future contracts from the affected customer or other customers 

investigation of customers from time to time one or more of our customers are audited or investigated by regulatory authorities or enforcement agencies with respect to regulatory compliance of their clinical trials programs or the marketing and sale of their drugs in these situations we have often provided services to our customers with respect to the clinical trials programs or activities being audited or investigated and we are called upon to respond to requests for information by the authorities and agencies there is a risk that either our customers or regulatory authorities could claim that we performed our services improperly or that we are responsible for clinical trial or program compliance if our customers or regulatory authorities make such claims against us and prove them we could be subject to damages fines or penalties in addition negative publicity regarding regulatory compliance of our customers’ clinical trials programs or drugs could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

insufficient customer funding to complete a clinical trial as noted above clinical trials can cost hundreds of millions of dollars there is a risk that we may initiate a clinical trial for a customer and then the customer becomes unwilling or unable to fund the completion of the trial in such a situation notwithstanding the customer’s ability or willingness to pay for or otherwise facilitate the completion of the trial we may be ethically bound to complete or wind down the trial at our own expense 

our research and development services could subject us to potential liability that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our business involves the testing of new drugs on patients in clinical trials and if marketing approval is granted the availability of these drugs to be prescribed to patients our involvement in the clinical trials and development process creates a risk of liability for personal injury to or death of patients particularly those with lifethreatening illnesses resulting from adverse reactions to the drugs administered during testing or after product launch respectively for example we have from time to time been sued and may be sued in the future by 

 

individuals alleging personal injury due to their participation in clinical trials and seeking damages from us under a variety of legal theories although we maintain the types and amounts of insurance customary in the industries and countries in which we operate if we are required to pay damages or incur defense costs in connection with any personal injury claim that is outside the scope of indemnification agreements we have with our customers if any indemnification agreement is not performed in accordance with its terms or if our liability exceeds the amount of any applicable indemnification limits or available insurance coverage our financial condition results of operations and reputation could be materially and adversely affected currently we maintain professional liability insurance including products liability for completed operations coverage with annual aggregate limits in excess of 500 million in the future we may not be able to get adequate insurance for these types of risks at reasonable rates 

we also contract with physicians to serve as investigators in conducting clinical trials if the investigators commit errors or make omissions during a clinical trial that result in harm to trial patients or after a clinical trial to a patient using the drug after it has received regulatory approval claims for personal injury or products liability damages may result additionally if the investigators engage in fraudulent behavior trial data may be compromised which may require us to repeat the clinical trial or subject us to liability we do not believe we are legally responsible for the medical care rendered by such thirdparty investigators and we would vigorously defend any claims brought against us however it is possible we could be found liable for claims with respect to the actions of thirdparty investigators 

some of our services involve direct interaction with clinical trial subjects or volunteers and operation of phase i clinical facilities which could create potential liability that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we operate two facilities where phase i clinical trials are conducted which ordinarily involve testing an investigational drug on a limited number of healthy individuals typically 20 to 80 persons to determine such drug’s basic safety failure to operate such a facility in accordance with applicable regulations could result in that facility being shut down which could disrupt our operations additionally we face risks associated with adverse events resulting from the administration of such drugs to healthy volunteers and the professional malpractice of medical care providers occasionally physicians employed at our phase i clinical facilities act as principal investigators in laterphase trials at those same facilities we also directly employ nurses and other trained employees who assist in implementing the testing involved in our clinical trials such as drawing blood from healthy volunteers any professional malpractice or negligence by such investigators nurses or other employees could potentially result in liability to us in the event of personal injury to or death of a healthy volunteer in clinical trials this liability particularly if it were to exceed the limits of any indemnification agreements and insurance coverage we may have may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

our commercial services could result in liability to us if a drug causes harm to a patient while we are generally indemnified and insured against such risks we may still suffer financial losses 

when we market drugs under contract for a biopharmaceutical company we could suffer liability for harm allegedly caused by those drugs either as a result of a lawsuit against the biopharmaceutical company to which we are joined a lawsuit naming us or any of our subsidiaries or an action launched by a regulatory body while we are indemnified by the biopharmaceutical company for the action of the drugs we market on its behalf and we carry insurance to cover harm caused by our negligence in performing services it is possible that we could nonetheless incur financial losses regulatory penalties or both in particular any claim could result in potential liability for us if the claim is outside the scope of the indemnification agreement we have with the biopharmaceutical company the biopharmaceutical company does not abide by the indemnification agreement as required or the liability exceeds the amount of any applicable indemnification limits or available insurance coverage such a finding could have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and reputation furthermore negative publicity associated with harm caused by drugs we helped to market could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

 

our insurance may not cover all of our indemnification obligations and other liabilities associated with our operations 

we maintain insurance designed to provide coverage for ordinary risks associated with our operations and our ordinary indemnification obligations with annual aggregate limits in excess of 500 million the coverage provided by such insurance may not be adequate for all claims we may make or may be contested by our insurance carriers if our insurance is not adequate or available to pay liabilities associated with our operations or if we are unable to purchase adequate insurance at reasonable rates in the future our profitability may be adversely impacted 

if we are unable to attract suitable investigators and patients for our clinical trials our clinical development business might suffer 

the recruitment of investigators and patients for clinical trials is essential to our business investigators are typically located at hospitals clinics or other sites and supervise the administration of the investigational drug to patients during the course of a clinical trial patients generally include people from the communities in which the clinical trials are conducted our clinical development business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract suitable and willing investigators or patients for clinical trials on a consistent basis for example if we are unable to engage investigators to conduct clinical trials as planned or enroll sufficient patients in clinical trials we might need to expend additional funds to obtain access to resources or else be compelled to delay or modify the clinical trial plans which may result in additional costs to us 

if we lose the services of key personnel or are unable to recruit experienced personnel our business could be adversely affected 

our success substantially depends on the collective performance contributions and expertise of our senior management team and other key personnel including qualified management professional scientific and technical operating staff and qualified sales representatives for our contract sales services there is significant competition for qualified personnel particularly those with higher educational degrees such as a medical degree a phd or an equivalent degree in the biopharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical services industries the departure of any key executive or our inability to continue to identify attract and retain qualified personnel or replace any departed personnel in a timely fashion may impact our ability to grow our business and compete effectively in our industry and may negatively affect our ability to meet financial and operational goals 

exchange rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial condition 

in 2014 approximately 38 of our service revenues were denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar because a large portion of our service revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar and our financial statements are reported in united states dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition exchange rate fluctuations between local currencies and the united states dollar create risk in several ways including 

foreign currency translation risk the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies and translated into united states dollars for financial reporting purposes accordingly exchange rate fluctuations will affect the translation of foreign results into united states dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated results 

foreign currency transaction risk we are subject to foreign currency transaction risk for fluctuations in exchange rates during the period of time between the consummation and cash settlement of a transaction we earn revenue from our service contracts over a period of several months and in some cases over several years accordingly exchange rate fluctuations during this period may affect our profitability with respect to such contracts 

 

we may limit these risks through exchange rate fluctuation provisions stated in our service contracts or we may hedge our transaction risk with foreign currency exchange contracts or options we have not however hedged 100 of our foreign currency transaction risk and we may experience fluctuations in financial results from our operations outside the united states and foreign currency transaction risk associated with our service contracts 

disruptions in the credit and capital markets and unfavorable general economic conditions could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

disruptions in the credit and capital markets could have negative effects on our business that may be difficult to predict or anticipate including the ability of our customers vendors contractors and financing sources to meet their contractual obligations although we are unable to quantify the impact it has had on us we are aware of a limited number of instances during the past several years where cancellations changes in scope and failure to pay timely were attributable at least in part to difficulty in our customers’ ability to obtain financing in the future such actions by our customers could if they involve a significant amount of business with us have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our effective income tax rate may fluctuate which may adversely affect our operations earnings and earnings per share 

our effective income tax rate is influenced by our projected profitability in the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate changes in the distribution of profits and losses among taxing jurisdictions may have a significant impact on our effective income tax rate which in turn could have an adverse effect on our net income and earnings per share factors that may affect our effective income tax rate include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 these changes may cause fluctuations in our effective income tax rate that could adversely affect our results of operations and cause fluctuations in our earnings and earnings per share 

we have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights and these rights are important to our success 

our success depends in part upon our ability to develop use and protect our proprietary methodologies analytics systems technologies and other intellectual property existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights and the protection in some countries may be very limited we rely upon a combination of trade secrets confidentiality policies nondisclosure invention assignment and other contractual arrangements and patent copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights these laws are subject to change at any time and certain agreements may not be fully enforceable which could further restrict our ability to protect our innovations our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing services similar to or duplicative of ours further the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors former 

 

employees or other third parties and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights enforcing our rights might also require considerable time money and oversight and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights 

depending on the circumstances we might need to grant a specific customer greater rights in intellectual property developed in connection with a contract than we otherwise generally do in certain situations we might forego all rights to the use of intellectual property we create which would limit our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other customers any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenuegenerating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop or license new or modified solutions for future projects 

our relationships with existing or potential customers who are in competition with each other may adversely impact the degree to which other customers or potential customers use our services which may adversely affect our results of operations 

the biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive with biopharmaceutical companies each seeking to persuade payers providers and patients that their drug therapies are better and more costeffective than competing therapies marketed or being developed by competing firms in addition to the adverse competitive interests that biopharmaceutical companies have with each other biopharmaceutical companies also have adverse interests with respect to drug selection and reimbursement with other participants in the healthcare industry including payers and providers biopharmaceutical companies also compete to be first to market with new drug therapies we regularly provide services to biopharmaceutical companies who compete with each other and we sometimes provide services or funding to such customers regarding competing drugs in development our existing or future relationships with our biopharmaceutical customers may therefore deter other biopharmaceutical customers from using our services or may result in our customers seeking to place limits on our ability to serve other biopharmaceutical industry participants in addition our further expansion into the broader healthcare market may adversely impact our relationships with biopharmaceutical customers and such customers may elect not to use our services reduce the scope of services that we provide to them or seek to place restrictions on our ability to serve customers in the broader healthcare market with interests that are adverse to theirs any loss of customers or reductions in the level of revenues from a customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations business and prospects 

if we are unable to successfully identify acquire and integrate existing businesses services and technologies our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 

we anticipate that a portion of our future growth may come from acquiring existing businesses services or technologies the success of any acquisition will depend upon among other things our ability to effectively integrate acquired personnel operations products and technologies into our business and to retain the key personnel and customers of our acquired businesses in addition we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or obtain any necessary financing on commercially acceptable terms we may also spend time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition targets but not complete the transaction any future acquisition could involve other risks including among others the assumption of additional liabilities and expenses difficulties and expenses in connection with integrating the acquired companies and achieving the expected benefits issuances of potentially dilutive securities or interestbearing debt loss of key employees of the acquired companies transaction costs diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and with respect to the acquisition of foreign companies the inability to overcome differences in foreign business practices language and customs our failure to identify potential acquisitions complete targeted acquisitions and integrate completed acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

investments in our customers’ businesses or drugs and our related commercial rights strategies could have a negative impact on our financial performance 

we may enter into arrangements with our customers or other drug companies in which we take on some of the risk of the potential success or failure of their businesses or drugs including making strategic investments in our customers or other drug companies providing financing to customers or other drug companies or acquiring an interest in the revenues from customers’ drugs or in entities developing a limited number of drugs as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 380 million of such arrangements and we were also committed to invest an additional 250 million in the novaquest pharma opportunities fund iii lp a private equity fund that seeks to enter into similar riskbased arrangements our financial results would be adversely affected if these investments or the underlying drugs result in losses or do not achieve the level of success that we anticipate andor our return or payment from the drug investment or financing is less than our direct and indirect costs with respect to these arrangements 

our results of operations may be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our goodwill and intangible assets 

as of december 31 2014 we had goodwill and net intangible assets of 7447 million which constituted approximately 225 of our total assets at the end of this period we assess the realizability of our indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill annually and conduct an interim evaluation whenever events or changes in circumstances such as operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset indicate that these assets may be impaired our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of the businesses we have acquired which in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses into our own business if we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets such impairment charges could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we face risks arising from the restructuring of our operations 

from time to time we have adopted restructuring plans to improve our operating efficiency through various means such as reduction of overcapacity elimination of nonbillable support roles or other realignment of resources for example in 2014 our board approved restructuring plans of up to 13 million which resulted in a reduction of approximately 250 positions in february 2013 our board approved a restructuring plan of up to 15 million which resulted in a reduction of approximately 400 positions restructuring presents significant potential risks of events occurring that could adversely affect us including a decrease in employee morale the failure to achieve targeted cost savings and the failure to meet operational targets and customer requirements due to the loss of employees and any work stoppages that might occur 

we depend on third parties for critical support services 

we depend on third parties for support services vital to our business such support services include but are not limited to thirdparty transportation providers suppliers of drugs for patients participating in clinical trials suppliers of kits for use in our central laboratory business suppliers of reagents for use in our testing equipment and providers of maintenance contracts for our equipment the failure of any of these third parties to adequately provide the critical support services could have a material adverse effect on our business 

risks relating to our industry 

the biopharmaceutical services industry is highly competitive 

the biopharmaceutical services industry is highly competitive we often compete for business with other biopharmaceutical services companies internal discovery departments development departments and sales and marketing departments within our customers some of which could be considered large biopharmaceutical services companies in their own right with greater resources than ours we also compete with universities and 

 

teaching hospitals if we do not compete successfully our business will suffer the industry is highly fragmented with numerous smaller specialized companies and a handful of fullservice companies with global capabilities similar to ours increased competition has led to price and other forms of competition such as acceptance of less favorable contract terms that could adversely affect our operating results there are few barriers to entry for smaller specialized companies considering entering the industry because of their size and focus these companies might compete effectively against larger companies such as us which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

outsourcing trends in the biopharmaceutical industry and changes in aggregate spending and rd budgets could adversely affect our operating results and growth rate 

economic factors and industry trends that affect biopharmaceutical companies affect our business biopharmaceutical companies continue to seek longterm strategic collaborations with global cros with favorable pricing terms competition for these collaborations is intense and we may decide to forego an opportunity or we may not be selected in which case a competitor may enter into the collaboration and our business with the customer if any may be limited in addition if the biopharmaceutical industry reduces its outsourcing of clinical trials and sales and marketing projects or such outsourcing fails to grow at projected rates our operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected we may also be negatively impacted by consolidation and other factors in the biopharmaceutical industry which may slow decision making by our customers or result in the delay or cancellation of clinical trials our commercial services may be affected by reductions in new drug launches and increases in the number of drugs losing patent protection all of these events could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may be affected by healthcare reform and potential additional reforms 

the united states congress continues to consider healthcare reform legislation and impose health industry cost containment measures which may significantly impact the biopharmaceutical industry in addition numerous government bodies are considering or have adopted various healthcare reforms and may undertake or are in the process of undertaking efforts to control growing healthcare costs through legislation regulation and voluntary agreements with medical care providers and biopharmaceutical companies we are uncertain as to the effects of these recent reforms on our business and are unable to predict what legislative proposals if any will be adopted in the future if regulatory cost containment efforts limit the profitability of new drugs our customers may reduce their rd spending or promotional marketing and sales expenditures which could reduce the business they outsource to us similarly if regulatory requirements are relaxed or simplified drug approval procedures are adopted the demand for our services could decrease 

government bodies may also adopt healthcare legislation or regulations that are more burdensome than existing regulations for example product safety concerns and recommendations by the drug safety oversight board could change the regulatory environment for drug products and new or heightened regulatory requirements may increase our expenses or limit our ability to offer some of our services additionally new or heightened regulatory requirements may have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to conduct industrysponsored clinical trials which could reduce the need for our services 

actions by government regulators or customers to limit a prescription’s scope or withdraw an approved drug from the market could adversely affect our business and result in a loss of revenues 

government regulators have the authority after approving a drug to limit its scope of prescription or withdraw it from the market completely based on safety concerns similarly customers may act to voluntarily limit the scope of prescription of drugs or withdraw them from the market in the past we have provided services with respect to drugs that have been limited andor withdrawn if we are providing services to customers for drugs that are limited or withdrawn we may be required to narrow the scope of or terminate our services with respect to such drugs which would prevent us from earning the full amount of service revenues anticipated under the related service contracts with negative impacts to our financial results 

 

current and proposed laws and regulations regarding the protection of personal data could result in increased risks of liability or increased cost to us or could limit our service offerings 

the confidentiality collection use and disclosure of personal data including clinical trial patientspecific information are subject to governmental regulation generally in the country that the personal data were collected or used for example united states federal regulations under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa and as amended in 2014 by the health information technology for economic and clinical health “hitech” act require individuals’ written authorization in addition to any required informed consent before protected health information may be used for research such regulations specify standards for deidentifications and for limited data sets we are both directly and indirectly affected by the privacy provisions surrounding individual authorizations because many investigators with whom we are involved in clinical trials are directly subject to them as a hipaa “covered entity” and because we obtain identifiable health information from third parties that are subject to such regulations as there are some instances where we are a hipaa “business associate” of a “covered entity” we can also be directly liable for mishandling protected health information under hipaa’s enforcement scheme we can be subject to up to 15 million in annual civil penalties for each hipaa violation 

in the european union or eu personal data includes any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person with health information carrying additional obligations including obtaining the explicit consent from the individual for collection use or disclosure of the information in addition we are subject to eu rules with respect to crossborder transfers of such data out of the eu the united states the eu and its member states and other countries where we have operations such as japan south korea malaysia the philippines russia and singapore continue to issue new privacy and data protection rules and regulations that relate to personal data and health information failure to comply with certain certificationregistration and annual recertificationregistration provisions associated with these data protection and privacy regulations and rules in various jurisdictions or to resolve any serious privacy complaints could subject us to regulatory sanctions criminal prosecution or civil liability federal state and foreign governments are contemplating or have proposed or adopted additional legislation governing the collection possession use or dissemination of personal data such as personal health information and personal financial data as well as security breach notification rules for loss or theft of such data additional legislation or regulation of this type might among other things require us to implement new security measures and processes or bring within the legislation or regulation deidentified health or other personal data each of which may require substantial expenditures or limit our ability to offer some of our services additionally if we violate applicable laws regulations or duties relating to the use privacy or security of personal data we could be subject to civil liability or criminal prosecution be forced to alter our business practices and suffer reputational harm in the next few years the european data protection framework may be revised as a generally applicable data regulation the text has not yet been finalized but it contains new provisions specifically directed at the processing of health information sanctions of up to 5 of worldwide gross revenue and extraterritoriality measures intended to bring noneu companies under the proposed regulation 

if we do not keep pace with rapid technological changes our services may become less competitive or obsolete 

the biopharmaceutical industry generally and drug development and clinical research more specifically are subject to rapid technological changes our current competitors or other businesses might develop technologies or services that are more effective or commercially attractive than or render obsolete our current or future technologies and services if our competitors introduce superior technologies or services and if we cannot make enhancements to remain competitive our competitive position would be harmed if we are unable to compete successfully we may lose customers or be unable to attract new customers which could lead to a decrease in our revenue and financial condition 

 

the biopharmaceutical industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and we might be involved in costly intellectual property lawsuits 

the biopharmaceutical industry has a history of intellectual property litigation and these lawsuits will likely continue in the future accordingly we may face patent infringement suits by companies that have patents for similar business processes or other suits alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights legal proceedings relating to intellectual property could be expensive take significant time and divert management’s attention from other business concerns regardless of the outcome of the litigation if we do not prevail in an infringement lawsuit brought against us we might have to pay substantial damages and we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license to use technology on unfavorable terms 

risks relating to our indebtedness 

our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial condition 

as of december 31 2014 we had 3306 billion in total assets 4010 billion in total liabilities and a shareholders’ deficit of 704 million included within total liabilities was 2293 billion of total indebtedness excluding 4000 million of additional available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and 250 million of additional available borrowings under our receivables financing facility our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and thus make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our credit facilities if our cash flow is not sufficient to service our debt and adequately fund our business we may be required to seek further additional financing or refinancing or dispose of assets we may not be able to influence any of these alternatives on satisfactory terms or at all our substantial indebtedness could also 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 despite our level of indebtedness we are able to incur more debt and undertake additional obligations incurring such debt or undertaking such additional obligations could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition 

although our credit agreement which governs the senior credit facilities of our wholly owned subsidiary through which we conduct our operations quintiles transnational corp or quintiles transnational contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could increase in addition the receivables financing agreement for our special purpose subsidiary quintiles funding llc or quintiles funding limits borrowing based on the amount of receivables purchased by quintiles funding from certain of our other subsidiaries but when supported by the value of such purchased receivables the debt under 

 

our receivables financing facility can increase we have 4000 million available for borrowing under our senior secured revolving credit facility and 250 million of additional available borrowings under our receivables financing facility 

while the credit agreement also contains restrictions on our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to make loans and investments these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the investments incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 

if we do not comply with the covenants governing our credit facilities we may not have the funds necessary to pay all of our indebtedness that could become due 

the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities requires us to comply with certain covenants in particular our credit agreement prohibits us from incurring any additional indebtedness except in specified circumstances or amending the terms of agreements relating to certain existing junior indebtedness if any in a manner materially adverse to the lenders under our credit agreement without lender approval further our credit agreement contains customary covenants including covenants that restrict our ability to acquire and dispose of assets engage in mergers or reorganizations pay dividends or make investments in addition our credit agreement requires us to make mandatory principal prepayments in certain circumstances including with a portion of our excess cash flow if quintiles transnational’s total leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement exceeds certain levels a violation of any of these covenants could cause an event of default under our credit agreement 

the receivables financing agreement for our receivables financing facility requires certain of our subsidiaries to transfer receivables with adequate value to the lender under that facility to support repayment of amounts outstanding in the event such transferred receivables are insufficient to support such outstanding amounts we will be required to make prepayments under the receivables financing agreement failure to make such prepayments or violations of the covenants in the receivables financing agreement could cause an event of default under the receivables financing agreement 

if we default on our senior secured credit agreement or our receivables financing agreement as a result of our failure to pay principal or interest when due our material breach of any representation warranty or covenant or any other reason all outstanding amounts could become immediately due and payable under either or both of such agreements in such case we may not have sufficient funds to repay all the outstanding amounts in addition or in the alternative the lenders under our senior secured credit agreement could exercise their rights under the security documents entered into in connection with the senior secured credit agreement any acceleration of amounts due under the credit agreement governing our outstanding indebtedness or the substantial exercise by the lenders under our senior secured credit agreement of their rights under the security documents would likely have a material adverse effect on us 

interest rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial condition 

because we have variable rate debt fluctuations in interest rates affect our business we attempt to minimize interest rate risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps we have entered into interest rate swaps with financial institutions that have reset dates and critical terms that match those of our senior secured term loan credit facility accordingly any change in market value associated with the interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 20 billion of total indebtedness with variable interest at the greater of the three month libor or 125 plus 250 or 375 at december 31 2014 of which 9100 million or 448 was hedged at a fixed rate of 257 leaving approximately 11 billion of unhedged variable rate debt as of december 31 2014 we also had 2750 million of total indebtedness under our receivables financing facility with variable interest at libor plus 105 or 122 at december 31 2014 because we do not attempt to hedge all of our variable rate debt we may incur higher interest costs for the 

 

portion of our variable rate debt which is not hedged each quarterpoint increase or decrease in the variable interest rate would result in our interest expense changing by approximately 35 million per year under our unhedged variable rate debt 

risks relating to ownership of our common stock 

although we are no longer a “controlled company” within the meaning of the nyse rules we are relying on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements during a one year transition period 

we are no longer a “controlled company” within the meaning of the corporate governance standards contained in section 303a of the nyse listed company manual consequently as of november 10 2014 the nyse rules require that we 

 

  

  

 we intend to utilize the transition periods described above to achieve full compliance with these nyse requirements as a result at this time we do not have a majority of independent directors and our compensation and nominating and governance committees do not consist entirely of independent directors accordingly you do not and during these transition periods you will not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the nyse in addition if we are unable to comply with the heightened corporate governance requirements prior to the prescribed nyse deadlines we may incur penalties or our shares could be delisted 

provisions of our corporate governance documents could make an acquisition of our company more difficult and may prevent attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management even if beneficial to our shareholders 

provisions of our articles of incorporation and our bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a merger acquisition or other change in control of our company that shareholders may consider favorable including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock thereby depressing the market price of our common stock in addition these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove members of our board because our board is responsible for appointing the members of our management team these provisions could in turn frustrate or prevent any attempt to replace or remove current members of our management team among others these provisions include 1 our ability to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval 2 the requirement that our shareholders may not act without a meeting 3 requirements for advance notification of shareholder nominations and proposals contained in our bylaws 4 the absence of cumulative voting for our directors 5 requirements for shareholder approval of certain business combinations and 6 the limitations on director nominations contained in our shareholders agreement 

our operating results and share price may be volatile which could cause the value of our shareholders’ investments to decline 

our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future and such fluctuations may be significant in addition securities markets worldwide have experienced and are likely to continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could subject the market price of our shares to wide price fluctuations regardless of our operating performance our operating results and the trading price of our shares may fluctuate in response to various factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these and other factors many of which are beyond our control may cause our operating results and the market price for our shares to fluctuate substantially while we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares and may otherwise negatively affect the market price and liquidity of our shares in addition in the past when the market price of a stock has been volatile holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock if any of our shareholders brought a lawsuit against us we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation 

there may be sales of a substantial amount of our common stock by our current shareholders and these sales could cause the price of our common stock to fall 

as of february 5 2015 there were 124315113 shares of common stock outstanding approximately 415 of our outstanding common stock is held by parties to the shareholders agreement 

sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales will occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for us to raise funds through securities offerings in the future 

shareholders that are a party to an amended and restated registration rights agreement or the registration rights agreement may require us to register their shares for resale under the federal securities laws under the registration rights agreement we are required to pay the registration expenses associated with the registration of such shares not including the underwriting discounts commissions and transfer taxes registration of those shares would allow those shareholders to immediately resell their shares in the public market any such sales or the anticipation of such sales may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

since we have no current plans to pay regular cash dividends on our common stock shareholders may not receive any return on investment unless they sell their common stock for a price greater than that which they paid for it 

although we have previously declared dividends to our shareholders we do not currently anticipate paying any regular cash dividends on our common stock any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board and will depend on among other things our results of operations financial condition cash requirements contractual restrictions and other factors that our board may deem relevant in addition our ability to pay dividends is and may be limited by covenants of existing and any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur including under our existing credit facilities therefore any return on investment in our common stock is solely dependent upon the appreciation of the price of our common stock on the open market which may not occur see part ii item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities—policy” for more detail 

 

the parties to the shareholders agreement have significant influence over us including decisions that require the approval of our shareholders which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to shareholders for a vote 

the parties to the shareholders agreement own approximately 415 of the outstanding shares of our common stock among other things the shareholders agreement requires such shareholders to vote in favor of certain nominees to our board as a result this group potentially has the ability to influence or in some situations possibly control our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and the terms thereof and the ability to prevent any change in the composition of our board and any transaction that requires shareholder approval regardless of whether others believe that such change or transaction is in our best interests additionally the parties to the shareholders agreement are in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us one or more of the parties to the shareholders agreement may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us so long as the parties to the shareholders agreement continue to own a significant amount of our equity if they exercise their shareholder rights collectively they will be able to significantly influence our decisions

overview 

our business is currently organized in two reportable segments product development and integrated healthcare services 

for the year ended december 31 2014 our service revenues increased 3575 million or 94 to 42 billion at actual foreign exchange rates compared to 2013 our growth in service revenues excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations “constant currency” was 3832 million or 101 with 1832 million or 63 growth in the product development segment and 2000 million or 225 growth in the integrated healthcare services segment

net new business was 5602 million for the year ended december 31 2014 this net new business contributed to an ending backlog of 11244 million at december 31 2014 “net new business” and “backlog” are defined under “net new business reporting and backlog” in part i item 1 “business” of this annual report on form 10k 

product development 

product development provides services and expertise that allow biopharmaceutical companies to outsource the clinical development process from firstinman trials to postlaunch monitoring our comprehensive service offerings provide the support and functional expertise necessary at each stage of development as well as the systems and analytical capabilities to help our customers improve product development efficiency and effectiveness product development is comprised of clinical solutions and services and consulting clinical solutions and services provides services necessary to develop biopharmaceutical products these services include project management and clinical monitoring functions for conducting multisite trials generally phase iiiv collectively “core clinical” these also include clinical trial support services that improve clinical trial decisionmaking such as global laboratories data management biostatistical safety and pharmacovigilance early clinical development trials generally phase i and strategic planning and design services which help improve decisions and performance we also provide functional resourcing services that cover a range of areas consulting provides strategy and management consulting services based on life science expertise and advanced analytics as well as regulatory and compliance consulting services 

integrated healthcare services 

integrated healthcare services provides a broad array of services including commercial services such as providing contract pharmaceutical sales forces in key geographic markets as well as a growing number of healthcare business services for the broader healthcare sector our customized commercialization services are designed to accelerate the commercial success of biopharmaceutical and other healthrelated products service offerings include commercial services sales representatives strategy marketing communications and other areas related to commercialization realworld and late phase research drug therapy analysis realworld research and 

 

evidencebased medicine including research studies to prove a drug’s value other healthcare services comparative and costeffectiveness research capabilities decision support services medication adherence and health outcome optimization services and webbased systems for measuring quality improvement and ehr implementation and advisory services 

on july 1 2014 we completed the acquisition of encore for approximately 915 million in cash net of approximately 22 million of acquired cash 

industry outlook 

the potential of the cro market served by product development is primarily a function of two variables biopharmaceutical rd spending and the proportion of this spending that is outsourced outsourcing penetration we expect outsourced clinical development to cros to increase 68 annually from 2014 to 2017 of this annual growth we believe that up to 2 will be derived from increased rd expenditures with the remainder coming from increased outsourcing penetration we estimate that overall outsourcing penetration in 2014 was 39 we believe that our customers will continue to outsource a greater part of their activities to transform their value chain away from a vertically integrated model and focus on their core competencies to lower risk and improve return with a focus on selecting outsourcing partners that are able to demonstrate the ability to provide flexible and efficient delivery models that leverage patient data to help biopharmaceutical companies deliver more effective patient outcomes we believe that increased demand will create new opportunities for biopharmaceutical services companies particularly those with a global reach 

integrated healthcare services historically has focused on biopharmaceutical companies seeking to commercialize their products the total market served by integrated healthcare services is diverse which makes it difficult to estimate the current amount of outsourced integrated healthcare services and the expected growth in such services however based on our knowledge of these markets we believe that while the rate of outsourcing penetration varies by market within integrated healthcare services the overall outsourcing penetration of the estimated 98 billion addressable market is approximately 23 we believe that the market for realworld and late phase research and other healthcare services will evolve and expand and as a result there will be opportunities to grow our revenues and expand our service offerings as business models continue to evolve in the healthcare sector we believe that the growth rate for outsourcing across the integrated healthcare services markets to increase 68 annually from 2014 to 2017 

acquisitions 

we completed a number of acquisitions in 2012 2013 and 2014 to enhance our capabilities and offerings in certain areas in august 2012 we acquired expression analysis inc for 397 million to enhance our genetic sequencing and advanced bioinformatics expertise in september 2013 we acquired novella clinical inc or novella for approximately 1466 million net of approximately 262 million of acquired cash with contingent consideration of up to 210 million to complement our clinical service offerings through its focus on emerging companies and by adding expertise in oncology and medical devices in july 2014 we completed the acquisition of encore for approximately 915 million in cash net of approximately 22 million of acquired cash to enhance our ehr expertise see note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information with respect to these acquisitions the results of operations of acquired businesses have been included since the date of acquisition and were not significant to our consolidated results of operations 

sources of revenue 

total revenues are comprised of service revenues and revenues from reimbursed expenses service revenues primarily include the revenue we earn from providing product development and commercialization services to our customers with product development services representing 744 of our 2014 service revenues and 

 

integrated healthcare services representing 256 of our 2014 service revenues reimbursed expenses are comprised principally of payments to physicians investigators who oversee clinical trials and travel expenses for our clinical monitors and sales representatives reimbursed expenses may fluctuate from periodtoperiod due in part to where we are in the lifecycle of the many contracts that are in progress at a particular point in time for instance these passthrough costs tend to be higher during the early phases of clinical trials as a result of patient recruitment efforts as reimbursed expenses are passthrough costs to our customers with little to no profit and we believe that the fluctuations from period to period are not meaningful to our underlying performance we do not provide analysis of the fluctuations in these items or their impact on our financial results 

costs and expenses 

our costs and expenses are comprised primarily of our costs of revenues and selling general and administrative expenses 

our costs of revenues consist of service costs and reimbursed expenses service costs include compensation and benefits for billable employees depreciation of assets used in generating revenue and other expenses directly related to service contracts such as courier fees laboratory supplies professional services travel expenses and the cost of products sold under distribution agreements as noted above reimbursed expenses are comprised principally of payments to physicians investigators who oversee clinical trials and travel expenses for our clinical monitors and sales representatives 

selling general and administrative expenses include costs related to administrative functions including compensation and benefits travel professional services training and expenses for advertising it facilities and depreciation and amortization 

foreign currency fluctuations 

the impact from foreign currency fluctuations and constant currency information assumes constant foreign currency exchange rates based on the rates in effect for the comparable prioryear period were used in translation we believe that providing the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on certain financial results can facilitate analysis of periodtoperiod comparisons of business performance 

results of operations 

year ended december 31 2014 compared to the year ended december 31 2013 and the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the year ended december 31 2012 

backlog and net new business 

we began 2014 with backlog of 9855 million which was 13 higher than at the beginning of 2013 backlog at december 31 2014 was 11244 million 

net new business grew 14 in 2014 to 5602 million from 4899 million in 2013 driven by growth in both product development and integrated healthcare services product development’s net new business increased 16 to 4374 million in 2014 as compared to 3772 million in 2013 led by higher growth in net new business for functional resourcing services which included the renewal of two fiveyear contracts for clinical services and data management services growth in net new business for core clinical services in asia as well as net new business generated from the novella acquisition and clinical trial support services including early clinical development and lifecycle safety integrated healthcare services’ net new business increased 9 to 1228 million in 2014 as compared to 1127 million in 2013 related primarily to growth in commercial services in north america an increase in new business from realworld and late phase research services and net new business from the encore acquisition 

 

net new business grew 9 in 2013 to 4899 million from 4501 million in 2012 driven by growth in both product development and integrated healthcare services product development’s net new business increased 9 to 3772 million in 2013 as compared to 3474 million in 2012 led by increases in core clinical in north america and europe including projects awarded under two sole provider arrangements signed in 2013 and data management services which benefited from functional resourcing and the sole provider arrangements signed during 2013 integrated healthcare services’ net new business grew 10 in 2013 to 1127 million from 1027 million in 2012 due to an increase in north america and europe 

our backlog at december 31 2014 was 11244 million compared to backlog of 9855 million at december 31 2013 although an increase in backlog will generally result in an increase in revenues to be recognized over time depending on the level of contract modifications an increase in backlog at a particular point in time does not necessarily correspond directly to an increase in revenues during a particular period the extent to which contracts in backlog will result in revenue depends on many factors including but not limited to delivery against projected schedules the need for scope changes change orders contract cancellations and the nature duration size complexity and phase of the contracts each of which factors can vary significantly from time to time revenue recognition occurs over extended periods of time and is subject to unanticipated delays fluctuations in our reported backlog and net new business levels may result from the fact that we may receive a small number of relatively large orders in any given reporting period that may be included in our backlog and net new business because of these large orders our backlog and net new business in that reporting period may reach levels that may not be sustained in subsequent reporting periods as we increasingly compete for and enter into large contracts that are more global in nature we expect the rate at which our backlog and net new business convert into revenue to increase or lengthen our 11244 million of backlog at december 31 2014 included approximately 7593 million of backlog that we do not expect to generate revenue in 2015 as compared to our 9855 million of backlog at december 31 2013 which included approximately 6342 million of backlog that we did not expect to generate revenue in 2014 our ability to grow revenues in the near term at rates comparable to our recent historical results will depend on many factors including but not limited to the factors affecting the rate at which revenues are derived from backlog continued growth in net new business that will generate revenue and factors not within our control such as economic conditions and trends in the industry in which we do business 

service revenues 

 

 in 2014 our service revenues increased 3575 million or 94 as compared to 2013 this increase is comprised of constant currency revenue growth of approximately 3832 million or 101 offset by a negative impact of approximately 257 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency service revenue growth which includes the impact from the novella and encore acquisitions is comprised of a 1832 million increase in product development and a 2000 million increase in integrated healthcare services 

in 2013 our service revenues increased 1160 million or 31 as compared to 2012 this increase is comprised of constant currency revenue growth of approximately 1866 million or 51 partially offset by a negative impact of approximately 706 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency revenue growth which includes the impact from business combinations completed in 2012 and 2013 is comprised of a 2146 million increase in product development partially offset by a decrease of 280 million in integrated healthcare services 

 

costs of revenue service costs 

 

 when compared to 2013 service costs in 2014 increased 2127 million the increase included a constant currency increase in expenses of approximately 2535 million or 103 partially offset by a positive impact of approximately 408 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency service costs growth was due to incremental costs resulting from the novella and encore acquisitions and increases in compensation and related expenses due to 1 an increase in billable headcount needed to support our higher volume of revenue 2 annual merit increases and 3 a reduction of an accrual for statutory profit sharing of approximately 54 million in 2013 as a result of guidance handed down by an administrative court in france these increases in compensation and related expenses were partially offset by a 106 million increase in the benefit from research and development grants primarily from france and austria as well as efficiencies gained from restructuring activities taken in prior years 

when compared to 2012 service costs in 2013 increased 120 million the increase included a constant currency increase in expenses of approximately 850 million or 35 partially offset by a positive impact of approximately 730 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency service costs growth was due to annual merit increases in compensation and related expenses partially offset by cost efficiencies gained from restructuring actions taken in prior years as well as incremental costs resulting from the business combinations completed in 2012 and 2013 these increases were partially offset by a decline in other expenses directly related to our service contracts as well as by a reduction of an accrual for statutory profit sharing of approximately 54 million in 2013 as a result of guidance handed down by an administrative court in france 

selling general and administrative 

 

 the 218 million increase in selling general and administrative expenses in 2014 was due to a constant currency increase of 293 million or 34 partially offset by a decrease of 75 million from a positive foreign currency impact the constant currency increase was primarily due to 1 incremental costs from the novella and encore acquisitions 2 an increase in sharebased compensation and 3 increases in compensation and related expenses resulting primarily from annual merit increases and an increase in headcount these increases were partially offset by expenses incurred in 2013 that did not recur in 2014 including a 250 million fee paid in connection with the termination of our management agreement with affiliates of certain of our shareholders 100 million of severance expense associated with cost reduction programs executive separation costs of approximately 53 million and a 15 million fee paid in connection with the modification of an agreement for the business usage of an airplane owned by gf management company llc or gfm a company controlled by our executive chairman 

the 427 million increase in selling general and administrative expenses in 2013 was due to a constant currency increase of 590 million or 72 partially offset by a decrease of 163 million from a positive foreign currency impact the constant currency increase was primarily due to 1 expenses incurred related to a 

 

250 million fee paid in connection with the termination of our management agreement with affiliates of certain of our shareholders and a 15 million fee paid in connection with the modification of an agreement for the business usage of an airplane owned by gfm 2 severance accruals of approximately 100 million related to overhead cost reduction programs to be carried out in 2014 3 executive separation costs of approximately 53 million 4 the impact from the business combinations completed in 2012 and 2013 5 increases in compensation and related expenses resulting primarily from annual merit increases and 6 growth related increases in facilities costs and depreciation and amortization these increases were partially offset by lower travel costs lower sharebased compensation and the fact that 2012 included expenses related to a bonus paid to certain option holders in connection with dividends paid to our shareholders totaling 113 million which did not recur in 2013 the lower sharebased compensation was as a result of the fact that expense from recent stock option grants was more than offset by a 136 million decline in expense related to the repricing of certain stock options in 2012 that did not recur in 2013 

restructuring costs 

 

 during 2014 we recognized 90 million of restructuring charges net of reversals for changes in estimates which was primarily related to our 2014 restructuring plans to better align our resources with our strategic direction which resulted in a reduction of approximately 250 positions we believe that these plans will result in annualized cost savings of approximately 200 to 250 million 

during 2013 we recognized 141 million of restructuring charges net of reversals for changes in estimates which was primarily related to our february 2013 restructuring plan to migrate the delivery of services and to reduce anticipated overcapacity in selected areas which resulted in a reduction of approximately 400 positions we believe that this plan has resulted in annual cost savings of approximately 150 to 200 million 

during 2012 we recognized 187 million of restructuring charges net of reversals for changes in estimates which was primarily related to our may 2012 restructuring plan to reduce staffing overcapacity and to rationalize nonbillable support roles which resulted in a reduction of approximately 280 positions primarily in europe we believe that this plan has resulted in annual cost savings of approximately 150 to 250 million 

interest income and interest expense 

 

 interest income includes interest received from bank balances and investments 

interest expense during 2014 was lower than 2013 in part due to a decrease in the average rate of interest the average rate of interest on the term loan under our senior secured credit facility during 2014 was lower than it was during 2013 due to a reduction in the interest rate pursuant to the terms and conditions in the credit agreement as well as from the refinancing transaction we completed in the fourth quarter of 2013 in addition to the lower average rate of interest interest expense during 2014 also benefited from a decrease in the average debt outstanding as a result of the repayment of the 3000 million term loan which quintiles transnational holdings 

 

inc obtained in february 2012 and paid in full in may 2013 the pay down of 500 million of outstanding indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities in may 2013 the mandatory prepayment of 338 million of outstanding indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities in the first quarter of 2013 and the 250 million prepayment of outstanding indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities in december 2014 these repayments more than offset the impact on the average debt outstanding of the 2750 million term loan issued under the receivables financing facility in december 2014 and the 1500 million draw on our line of credit in 2014 which was repaid with the proceeds of the receivables financing facility term loan 

interest expense for 2013 was lower than 2012 primarily due to a decrease in the average debt outstanding in 2013 compared to 2012 resulting from the repayment of the 3000 million term loan which quintiles transnational holdings inc obtained in february 2012 and paid in full in may 2013 the pay down of 500 million of outstanding indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities in may 2013 and the mandatory prepayment of 338 million of outstanding indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities in the first quarter of 2013 offset by the increase that resulted from the 1750 million term loan b1 which our whollyowned subsidiary quintiles transnational obtained under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities in october 2012 in addition the average rate of interest in 2013 on the term loans under our senior secured credit facilities was lower than it was in 2012 due to 1 a 50 basis point decrease in the interest rate on the term loan b2 beginning in august 2013 pursuant to the terms and conditions in the credit agreement and 2 the reductions in the interest rate that resulted from the refinancing transactions in the fourth quarters of 2012 and 2013 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

 

 in december 2013 we recognized a 33 million loss on extinguishment of debt on a portion of the debt retired related to the refinancing of our senior secured credit facilities the loss on extinguishment of debt included 16 million of unamortized debt issuance costs 16 million of unamortized discount and 25000 of fees and expenses

in 2012 we recognized a 13 million loss on extinguishment of debt on a portion of the debt retired related to our 2012 refinancing the loss on extinguishment of debt included 634000 of unamortized debt issuance costs 631000 of unamortized discount and 10000 of fees and expenses 

see “—liquidity and capital resources” for more information on these transactions 

other income expense net 

 

  

other income expense net for 2014 included income of approximately 86 million due to changes in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration from an acquisition as well as a gain from the sale of marketable equity securities of approximately 50 million partially offset by other expenses primarily consisting of 49 million of foreign currency net losses 

other income expense net for 2013 included income of approximately 35 million due to changes in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration for two of our acquisitions completed in 2011 in addition 2013 included approximately 40 million of foreign currency net losses 

other income expense net for 2012 included income of approximately 46 million due to changes in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration for two of our acquisitions completed in 2011 in addition 2012 included approximately 11 million of foreign currency net losses 

income tax expense 

 

 the effective income tax rate for 2013 was negatively impacted by the settlement of certain intercompany notes in 2013 that had previously been considered longterm investments which resulted in 111 million of income tax expense this negative impact was primarily offset by our change in assertion regarding the undistributed earnings of most of our foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states prior to june 2013 we had not considered the majority of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested accordingly 2012 was negatively impacted by income taxes provided on most of the earnings of the foreign subsidiaries as a deferred income tax liability was recorded for the anticipated income tax costs of repatriating those earnings in the future we reevaluated this assertion following the ipo as a portion of the ipo proceeds were used to pay down debt held in the united states as well as the fact we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future which had been significant in the past given our current debt balance and related interest expense and the change in approach related to payment of dividends we expect to be able to support the cash needs of our domestic subsidiaries without repatriating cash from the affected foreign subsidiaries we expect to utilize the cash generated outside of the united states to fund growth outside of the united states as a result of the assertion change we recorded an 81 million income tax benefit in the second quarter of 2013 to reverse the deferred income tax liability previously recorded on undistributed foreign earnings prior to 2013 that are now considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states 

equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates 

 

 equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates in 2014 increased as compared to 2013 primarily due to gains from our investment in the novaquest pharma opportunities fund iii lp partially offset by losses and writedowns incurred on another equity method investment 

 

segments 

service revenues and income from operations by segment are as follows dollars in millions 

 

 certain costs are not allocated to our segments and are reported as general corporate and unallocated expenses these costs primarily consist of sharebased compensation and expenses for corporate office functions such as senior leadership finance human resources it facilities and legal as well as certain expenses incurred in the second quarter of 2013 including the 250 million fee incurred in connection with the termination of the management agreement with affiliates of certain shareholders and the 15 million fee paid in connection with the modification of an agreement for the business usage of an airplane owned by gfm we do not allocate restructuring or impairment charges to our segments 

product development 

 

 service revenues 

2014 compared to 2013 

product development’s service revenues were 31 billion in 2014 an increase of 1781 million or 61 over 2013 this increase was comprised of constant currency service revenue growth of 1832 million or 63 offset by a negative impact of approximately 51 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency service revenue growth was primarily a result of a volumerelated increase of 1002 million in clinical solutions and services and 896 million from the novella acquisition which were partially offset by a decrease of 66 from consulting services 

the volumerelated service revenue growth was primarily from clinical solutions and services and was related to an increase in clinical solutions provided on a functional resource basis clinical trial support services core clinical services in asia and japan and global laboratories services this growth was due largely to execution on the higher backlog in place as we entered 2014 the rate of yearoveryear revenue growth was negatively impacted by the winddown of a large clinical solutions project delivered throughout 2013 

 

2013 compared to 2012 

product development’s service revenues were 29 billion in 2013 an increase of 1910 million or 70 over 2012 this increase is comprised of constant currency service revenue growth of 2146 million or 79 partially offset by a negative impact of approximately 236 million due to the effect of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency service revenue growth was primarily a result of a volumerelated increase of 1914 million in clinical solutions and services and 524 million from businesses acquired in the third quarters of 2012 and 2013 which were partially offset by a decrease of 292 million from consulting services 

our clinical solutions and services growth for 2013 was concentrated in europe and the americas this growth was due largely to growth in the overall market as well as a consistent history of yearoveryear growth in net new business including strong inflow of net new business in 2013 this growth was tempered by a decrease in service revenues from consulting services resulting primarily from the winding down of a project assisting a customer on a regulatory compliance matter and from a large clinical solutions project on which we were executing in 2012 and 2013 but that was winding down in 2013

2013 compared to 2012 

integrated healthcare services’ service revenues were 8886 million in 2013 a decrease of 750 million or 78 compared to 2012 this decrease was primarily due to a negative impact of approximately 470 million due to the effect of foreign currency fluctuations coupled with a constant currency service revenue decrease of 280 million or 29 the decline in constant currency service revenues occurred primarily in commercial services in north america as revenues generated from strong new business in 2013 had not yet reached a level sufficient to offset the impact from scope reductions and cancellations that occurred in prior periods

selling general and administrative 

2014 compared to 2013 

integrated healthcare services’ selling general and administrative expenses in 2014 were higher as compared to 2013 primarily caused by the impact from the encore acquisition and higher compensation and related expenses the increase in compensation and related expenses resulted from annual merit increases and an increase in headcount these increases were partially offset by 16 million of costs incurred in 2013 that did not recur in 2014 for severance associated with cost reduction programs as well as a positive impact of approximately 900000 from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations 

2013 compared to 2012

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows in addition to operating cash flows other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include capital expenditures acquisitions investments debt service requirements dividends equity repurchases adequacy of our revolving credit facility and access to the capital markets 

we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which those funds can be accessed on a cost effective basis the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse income tax consequences in 2013 we changed our assertion regarding the earnings of most of our foreign subsidiaries and now consider them indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states making this assertion limits our ability to repatriate cash from our foreign 

 

subsidiaries for the foreseeable future in making this assertion we determined that the cash flows expected to be generated in the united states should be sufficient to fund our operating requirements and debt service obligations in the united states and that we intend to use the cash generated by the affected foreign subsidiaries to fund growth outside of the united states a future distribution or change in this assertion could result in additional tax liability 

we had a cash balance of 8674 million at december 31 2014 2109 million of which was in the united states an increase from 7781 million at december 31 2013

on october 30 2013 our board approved the repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to 1250 million of either our common stock or vested inthemoney employee stock options or a combination thereof through december 31 2014 we have used 655 million of cash to purchase 591 million of stock options and 64 million of common stock under the repurchase program we have used and intend to continue to use cash on hand to fund the repurchase program the repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any particular amount of common stock or vested inthemoney employee stock options and it can be modified suspended or discontinued at any time repurchases of vested inthemoney employee stock options were made through transactions between us and our employees other than our executive officers who were not eligible to participate in the program and this aspect of the repurchase program expired in november 2013 the repurchase program for common stock does not have an end date additional information regarding the repurchase program is presented in part ii item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” and note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

based on our current operating plan we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents future cash flows from operations and our ability to access funds under our revolving credit and receivables financing facility will enable us to fund our operating requirements and capital expenditures and meet debt obligations for at least the next 12 months we regularly evaluate our debt arrangements as well as market conditions and from time to time we may explore opportunities to modify our existing debt arrangements or pursue additional financing arrangements that could result in the issuance of new debt securities by us or our affiliates we may use our existing cash cash generated from operations or dispositions of assets or businesses andor proceeds from any 

 

new financing arrangements or issuances of debt or equity securities to repay or reduce some of our outstanding obligations to repurchase shares from our shareholders or for other purposes as part of our ongoing business strategy we also are continually evaluating new acquisition expansion and investment possibilities or other strategic growth opportunities as well as potential dispositions of assets or businesses as appropriate including dispositions that may cause us to recognize a loss on certain assets should we elect to pursue any such transaction we may seek to obtain debt or equity financing to facilitate those activities our ability to enter into any such potential transactions and our use of cash or proceeds is limited to varying degrees by the terms and restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facilities we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to complete any such alternative financing arrangements or other transactions on favorable terms or at all

cash flow from operating activities 

 

 2014 compared to 2013 

cash provided by operating activities increased by 384 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 the increase in operating cash flow reflects an increase in net income lower payments for interest 216 million and lower cash used in days sales outstanding or dso 211 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 this lower cash used in dso reflects a twoday increase in dso in 2014 compared to a fiveday increase in 2013 dso can shift significantly at each reporting period depending on the timing of cash receipts under contractual payment terms relative to the recognition of revenue over a project lifecycle in addition net income for 2013 included cash expenses totaling 325 million for a fee paid in connection with the termination of our management agreement with affiliates of certain of our shareholders 250 million a fee paid in connection with the modification of an agreement for the business usage of an airplane owned by gfm 15 million and a termination fee for the repayment of the 3000 million term loan 60 million which did not recur in 2014 these increases in operating cash flow were partially offset by higher payments for income taxes 679 million and higher cash used for incentive compensation

cash used in investing activities decreased by 631 million to 1731 million in 2014 as compared to 2362 million in 2013 this decline in the use of cash in 2014 was primarily related to lower cash used for the acquisition of businesses cash used to acquire businesses in 2014 was 922 million consisting primarily of the acquisition of encore as compared to 2013 which included the acquisition of novella for approximately 1450 million also contributing to the decline was lower cash used to acquire property equipment and software and an increase in proceeds from the sale of equity securities

      application of critical accounting policies 

note 1 to the consolidated financial statements provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates and related disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes known actual results may differ from those estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied 1 there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement 2 the service offering has been delivered to the customer 3 the collection of fees is probable and 4 the arrangement consideration is fixed or determinable we do not recognize revenue with respect to startup activities including contract and scope negotiation feasibility analysis and conflict of interest review associated with contracts the costs for these activities are expensed as incurred for contracts in which portions of revenue are contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future events we recognize the revenue only after it has been earned and the contingency has been resolved 

the majority of our revenue is recognized based on objective contractual criteria and does not require significant estimates or judgments however at any point in time we are working on thousands of active customer projects which are governed by individual contracts most projects are customized based on the needs of the customer the type of services being provided therapeutic indication of the drug geographic locations and other variables project specific terms related to pricing billing terms and the scope and type of services to be provided are generally negotiated and contracted on a projectbyproject basis changes in the scope of work are common especially under longterm contracts and generally result in a change in contract value in such situations we enter into negotiations for a contract amendment to reflect the change in scope and the related 

 

price depending on the complexity of the amendment the negotiation process can take from a few weeks for a simple adjustment to several months for a complex amendment management may authorize the project team to commence work on activities outside the contract scope while we negotiate and finalize the contract amendment in these limited cases if we are not able to obtain a contract amendment from the customer our profit margin on the arrangement may be impacted this result occurs because our costs of delivery are expensed as they are incurred while revenue is not recognized unless the customer has agreed to the changes in scope and renegotiated pricing terms the contract value is amended and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 

for arrangements that include multiple elements arrangement consideration is allocated to units of accounting based on the relative selling price the best evidence of selling price of a unit of accounting is vendorspecific objective evidence or vsoe which is the price we charge when the deliverable is sold separately when vsoe is not available to determine selling price we use relevant thirdparty evidence or tpe of selling price if available when neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists we use our best estimate of selling price considering all relevant information that is available without undue cost and effort 

most contracts are terminable upon 30 to 90 days notice by the customer our risk of material loss in these situations is mitigated as these contracts generally require payment to us for expenses to wind down the trial or project fees earned to date and in some cases a termination fee or a payment of some portion of the fees or profits that could have been earned under the contract if it had not been terminated early in addition our contract terms provide for payment terms that generally correspond with performance of the services termination fees are included in service revenues when realization is assured 

accounts receivable and unbilled services 

accounts receivable represents amounts billed to customers revenues recognized in excess of billings are classified as unbilled services the realization of these amounts is based on the customer’s willingness and ability to pay us we have an allowance for doubtful accounts based on management’s estimate of probable losses we expect to incur resulting from a customer failing to pay us our allowance for doubtful accounts and losses from customers failing to pay us have not been material to our results of operations if any of these estimates change or actual results differs from expected results then an adjustment is recorded in the period in which the amounts become reasonably estimable these adjustments could have a material effect on our results of operations 

investments in unconsolidated affiliates—equity method investments 

we have investments in unconsolidated affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting periodically we review our investments for a decline in value which we believe may be other than temporary should we identify such a decline we will record a loss through earnings to establish a new cost basis for the investment these losses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

income taxes 

certain items of income and expense are not recognized on our income tax returns and financial statements in the same year which creates timing differences the income tax effect of these timing differences results in 1 deferred income tax assets that create a reduction in future income taxes and 2 deferred income tax liabilities that create an increase in future income taxes recognition of deferred income tax assets is based on management’s belief that it is more likely than not that the income tax benefit associated with certain temporary differences income tax operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and income tax credits would be realized we recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets for those deferred income tax items for which it was more likely than not that realization would not occur we determined the amount of the valuation allowance based in part on our assessment of future taxable income and in light of our ongoing income tax strategies if our estimate of future taxable income or tax strategies changes at any time in the future we would record an adjustment to our valuation allowance recording such an adjustment could have a material effect on our financial position 

 

income tax expense is based on the distribution of profit before income tax among the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate adjusted as required by the income tax laws of each taxing jurisdiction changes in the distribution of profits and losses among taxing jurisdictions may have a significant impact on our effective income tax rate beginning in 2013 we consider the undistributed earnings of most of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states accordingly we have not provided a deferred income tax liability related to those undistributed earnings 

business combinations 

we use the acquisition method to account for business combinations and accordingly the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recorded at their estimated fair values on the date of the acquisition we use significant judgments estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest including expected future cash flows discount rates that reflect the risk associated with the expected future cash flows and estimated useful lives 

when a business combination involves contingent consideration we recognize a liability equal to the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the date of the acquisition the estimate of fair value of a contingent consideration liability requires subjective assumptions to be made regarding future business results including revenues and net new business discount rates that reflect the risk associated with the expected future cash flows and probabilities assigned to various potential business result scenarios we periodically reassess the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration over the term of the arrangement any resulting changes are recognized in earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations 

goodwill tangible and identifiable intangible assets 

we have recorded and allocated to our reporting units the excess of the cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired known as goodwill the recoverability of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated annually for impairment or if and when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized we review the carrying values of other identifiable intangible assets if the facts and circumstances indicate a possible impairment based upon our 2014 annual testing we believe that the risk of a significant impairment to goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets is currently very low other identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 

for goodwill we perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its book value this includes a qualitative analysis of macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations internal cost factors financial performance fair value history and other company specific events if this qualitative analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that estimated fair value is less than the book value for the respective reporting unit we apply a twostep impairment test in which we determine whether the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of its carrying value if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied estimated fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill we determine the implied estimated fair value of goodwill by determining the present value of the estimated future cash flows for each reporting unit and comparing the reporting unit’s risk profile and growth prospects to selected reasonably similar publicly traded companies the inherent subjectivity of applying a discounted cash flow and market comparables approach to valuing our assets and liabilities could have a significant impact on our analysis any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

for indefinitelived intangible assets we perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value if this qualitative analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value is less than the 

 

carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset we determine the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset trade name by determining the present value of the estimated royalty payments on an aftertax basis that it would be required to pay the owner for the right to use such trade name if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we review the carrying values of property and equipment if the facts and circumstances suggest that a potential impairment may have occurred if this review indicates that carrying values will not be recoverable as determined based on undiscounted cash flows over the remaining depreciation or amortization period we will reduce carrying values to estimated fair value the inherent subjectivity of our estimates of future cash flows could have a significant impact on our analysis any future writeoffs of longlived assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

sharebased compensation 

we measure compensation cost for most sharebased payment awards stock options and stock appreciation rights granted to employees and nonemployee directors at fair value using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model sharebased compensation expense includes sharebased awards granted to employees and nonemployee directors and has been reported in selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income based upon the classification of the individuals who were granted sharebased awards 

the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions including share price volatility the expected life of the award riskfree interest rate and the fair value of the underlying common shares on the date of grant in developing our assumptions we take into account the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and other relevant market rate or price changes in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to various market risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity price changes and we regularly evaluate our exposure to such changes our overall risk management strategy seeks to balance the magnitude of the exposure and the cost and availability of appropriate financial instruments from time to time we have utilized forward exchange contracts to manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk the following analyses present the sensitivity of our financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest rates and equity prices that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period 

foreign currency exchange rates 

approximately 38 of our service revenues for both years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 were denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar our financial statements are reported in united 

 

states dollars and accordingly fluctuations in exchange rates will affect the translation of our revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies into united states dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results in 2014 and 2013 the most significant currency exchange rate exposures were the euro british pound singapore dollar and indian rupee excluding the impacts from any outstanding or future hedging transactions a hypothetical change of 10 in average exchange rates used to translate all foreign currencies to united states dollars would have impacted income before income taxes for 2014 by approximately 405 million accumulated currency translation adjustments recorded as a separate component of shareholders’ deficit were 557 million and 58 million at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively we do not have significant operations in countries in which the economy is considered to be highlyinflationary 

we are subject to foreign currency transaction risk for fluctuations in exchange rates during the period of time between the consummation and cash settlement of a transaction we earn revenue from our service contracts over a period of several months and in some cases over a period of several years accordingly exchange rate fluctuations during this period may affect our profitability with respect to such contracts we limit our foreign currency transaction risk through exchange rate fluctuation provisions stated in our contracts with customers or we may hedge our transaction risk with foreign currency exchange contracts at december 31 2014 we had 13 open foreign exchange forward contracts relating to service contracts with various amounts maturing monthly through september 2015 with a notional value totaling approximately 760 million at december 31 2013 we had 12 open foreign exchange forward contracts relating to service contracts with various amounts maturing monthly through september 2014 with a notional value totaling approximately 608 million 

interest rates 

because we have variable rate debt fluctuations in interest rates affect our business we attempt to minimize interest rate risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps we have entered into interest rate swaps with financial institutions that have reset dates and critical terms that match those of our term loan credit facility accordingly any change in market value associated with the interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 20 billion of total indebtedness with variable interest at the greater of the three month libor or 125 plus 250 or 375 at december 31 2014 of which 9100 million or 448 was hedged at a fixed rate of 257 leaving approximately 11 billion of unhedged variable rate debt as of december 31 2014 we also had 2750 million of total indebtedness under our receivables financing facility with variable interest at libor plus 105 or 122 at december 31 2014 because we do not attempt to hedge all of our variable rate debt we may incur higher interest costs for the portion of our variable rate debt which is not hedged each quarterpoint increase or decrease in the variable interest rate would result in our interest expense changing by approximately 35 million per year under our unhedged variable rate debt 

equity prices 

at december 31 2014 and 2013 we held investments in marketable equity securities these investments are classified as availableforsale and are recorded at fair value in the financial statements these securities are subject to equity price risk as of december 31 2014 and 2013 the fair value of these investments was 831000 and 77 million respectively based on quoted equity prices the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease of 10 in quoted equity price was approximately 83000 and 767000 at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively

 item 1 business 

overview 

we are the world’s largest provider of biopharmaceutical development services and commercial outsourcing services we are positioned at the intersection of business services and healthcare and generated 38 billion of service revenues in 2013 conduct business in approximately 100 countries and have approximately 28200 employees we use the breadth and depth of our service offerings our global footprint and our therapeutic scientific and analytics expertise to help our biopharmaceutical customers as well as other healthcare customers to be more successful in an increasingly complex healthcare environment 

since our founding more than 30 years ago we have grown to become a leader in the development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical therapies our product development segment is the world’s largest contract research organization or cro as ranked by 2013 reported service revenues and is focused primarily on phase iiiv clinical trials and associated laboratory and analytical activities our integrated healthcare services segment includes one of the leading global commercial pharmaceutical sales and service organizations integrated healthcare services provides a broad array of services including commercial services such as providing contract pharmaceutical sales forces in key geographic markets as well as a growing number of healthcare business services for the broader healthcare sector such as outcomebased consulting and realworld research and other healthcare solutions product development contributed approximately 77 and integrated healthcare services contributed approximately 23 to our 2013 service revenues additional information regarding our segments is presented in note 21 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

our global scale and capabilities enable us to work with the leading companies in the biopharmaceutical sector that perform trials and market their products all around the world during each of the last 11 years we have worked with the 20 largest biopharmaceutical companies ranked by 2012 reported revenues we have provided services in connection with the development or commercialization of the top 50 bestselling biopharmaceutical products and the top 50 bestselling biologic products from 2012 as measured by reported sales of the new molecular entities or nmes and new biologic applications or blas approved from 2004 through 2012 we helped develop or commercialize 97 of the central nervous system drugs 93 of the oncology drugs and 89 of the cardiovascular drugs 

we have extensive scientific and therapeutic expertise including more than 950 employees globally who are medical doctors with experience across a number of fields we also have substantial statistical quantitative analytical and applied technology skills with more than 900 employees possessing a phd or equivalent our experts enable us to add sophisticated statistical process development and advanced technology applications into our clinical development services to meet the needs of the broader healthcare industry for appropriate endpoints adaptive trials drug therapy analysis outcomes and realworld research and evidencebased medicine our scientific and medical expertise allows us to conduct biomarker discovery perform gene sequencing and expression analysis create assays that can be duplicated on a global scale and support the evolving fields of translational science and personalized medicine moreover our flexible business solutions and commitment to our customers’ objectives enable us to provide our customers with customized operational delivery models to meet their particular needs 

in 2013 our service revenues were 38 billion and our net income attributable to our shareholders was 2266 million in addition our 2013 net new business was 49 billion and we ended the year with 99 billion in backlog see part i item 1 “business—net new business reporting and backlog” for more detail during each of the last six years we have had at least eight customers from whom we earned more than 100 million in service revenues no single customer represented more than 10 of our 2013 revenues 

our markets 

the market served by product development consists primarily of biopharmaceutical companies including medical device and diagnostics companies that are seeking to outsource clinical trials and other product development activities we estimate that total biopharmaceutical spending on drug development was approximately 93 billion in 2013 of which we estimate that our addressable market clinical development spending excluding preclinical spending was approximately 51 billion the portion of this 51 billion that was outsourced in 2013 based on our estimates was approximately 19 billion we estimate that the potential market for product development’s services will experience a compound annual growth rate or cagr of 68 from 2013 through 2016 as a result of increased research and development or rd spending by biopharmaceutical companies and the increased outsourcing of this spending as compared to 2012 in addition many compounds in the global product development pipeline relate to the therapeutic areas of oncology central nervous system and cardiovascular diseases and disorders which are our largest therapeutic areas as measured by service revenues 

 

integrated healthcare services primarily addresses markets related to the use of approved biopharmaceutical products we estimate that total spending related to approved drugs including biopharmaceutical spending on commercialization of these drugs and expenditures by participants in the broader healthcare market on realworld research and evidencebased medicine exceeded 94 billion in 2013 integrated healthcare services links product development to healthcare delivery this segment’s services include commercial services such as recruiting training deploying and managing a global sales force channel management patient engagement services market access consulting brand communication consulting and medical education in addition integrated healthcare services offers outcomebased services such as observational studies comparative effectiveness studies and product and disease registry services which are intended to help increase the quality and costeffectiveness of healthcare and provider payer solutions we believe that a combination of cost pressure in healthcare systems around the world and the increasing focus on the value and efficacy of pharmaceutical therapy provide us many opportunities to grow our revenues and expand our service offerings by improving the costeffectiveness of drug therapies 

we believe that we are wellpositioned to benefit from current trends in the biopharmaceutical and healthcare industries that affect our markets including 

trends in rd spending we estimate that rd spending was approximately 137 billion in 2013 and will grow to approximately 145 billion in 2016 with development accounting for approximately 68 of total expenditures rd spending trends are impacted as a result of several factors including major biopharmaceutical companies’ efforts to replenish revenues lost from the socalled “patent cliff” of recent years increased access to capital by the small and midcap biotechnology industry and recent increases in pharmaceutical approvals by regulatory authorities in 2013 there were approximately 4060 drugs in the phase iiii pipeline an increase of 19 since 2008 and there were 27 nme approvals by the united states food and drug administration or fda in 2013 which for the two year period of 2012 to 2013 showed the highest number of approvals since the late 1990’s we believe that further rd spending combined with the continued need for cost efficiency across the healthcare landscape will create new opportunities for biopharmaceutical services companies particularly those with a global reach and broad service offerings to help biopharmaceutical companies with their pre and postlaunch product development and commercialization needs 

growth in outsourcing we estimate that clinical development spending outsourced to cros in phases iiv in 2013 was approximately 19 billion and will grow to approximately 23 billion by 2016 we expect outsourced clinical development to cros to grow 68 annually during this period of this annual growth we believe that up to 2 will be derived from increased rd expenditures with the remainder coming from increased outsourcing penetration we estimate that overall outsourcing penetration in 2013 was 37 the market served by integrated healthcare services is diverse which makes it difficult to estimate the current amount of outsourced integrated healthcare services and the expected growth in such services however based on our knowledge of these markets we believe that while the rate of outsourcing penetration varies by market within integrated healthcare services the current outsourcing penetration of the estimated 94 billion addressable market is not more than 20 as business models continue to evolve in the healthcare sector we believe that the growth rate for outsourcing across the integrated healthcare services markets will be similar to the growth in clinical development 

over the longer term we believe that we are well positioned for the future evolution of the healthcare sector as increasing demand from governments and other payers around the world for quality accountability and value for money drive biopharmaceutical companies providers and other healthcare organizations to transform their value chain away from a vertically integrated model and focus on their core competencies in order to do this we believe that healthcare organizations will need to move towards variable cost structures to lower risk and improve returns in particular we believe that the following trends will result in increased outsourcing to global biopharmaceutical services companies of which we are the largest and most global 

 

  

  

  

  

 increase in strategic collaborations larger cros are able to provide a greater variety of services of value to the biopharmaceutical community biopharmaceutical companies are continuing to enter into longterm strategic collaborations with global service providers that enable them to utilize flexible business models and integrated end to end solutions to deliver on their strategic priorities we believe that biopharmaceutical companies have historically preferred and will continue to prefer financially sound global service providers with broad therapeutic and functional expertise such as our company when selecting strategic providers 

 

our competitive strengths 

we believe that we are positioned to be the partner of choice to biopharmaceutical companies worldwide and a key resource to other healthcare industry participants who are looking to improve operational therapeutic and patient outcomes we differentiate ourselves from others in our industry through our competitive strengths which include

technology solutions and processdata capabilities for over 30 years we have been devoted to advancing state of the art technology processes and analytics to optimize our service offerings and provide our customers with the information they need to quickly make critical decisions regarding the development and commercialization of their products we have focused on investment in quality data including deidentified electronic health records or ehr and we currently have access to ehr data representing more than 60 million patient lives in addition we have established a substantial digital network of registered users with whom we communicate regularly more than 3 million people are registered users of these digital services that provide opportunities to seek information and participate in clinical trials and observational studies because data are only as good as the analytics used to analyze them we have also invested heavily in data analytics products services and professionals as part of this investment we created our proprietary data integration tool quintiles infosario ®  which is a suite of services that integrates data from across multiple source systems to provide us and our customers with current quality and comprehensive information regarding clinical trials allowing decisions to be made quickly and efficiently in addition we have developed a planning and design platform and other software solutions to enable improvements to the drug development process and to demonstrate the value of biopharmaceutical products in the real world we have obtained or applied for more than 60 patents in connection with the development of our proprietary technology systems and processes 

our growth strategy 

the key elements of our growth strategy across product development and integrated healthcare services include 

leverage our leadership position and scale we are the global market leader in providing drug development commercialization and outcome analytics services and we have substantially larger service revenues and more employees around the world than reported by any of our public cro competitors we plan to continue to grow organically and through selected acquisitions to expand our services and capabilities we believe our portfolio of services enables us to provide a wide range of solutions for customers by taking an integrated view of the healthcare landscape we intend to leverage our global scale from our scientific and therapeutic expertise global investigator network central laboratory and data library to help our customers reduce costs improve efficiency and effectiveness and deliver better healthcare outcomes 

build upon our customer relationships we believe that the breadth and depth of our global operations service offerings therapeutic expertise analytics experience and technology combined with our existing relationships with participants across the healthcare industry position us well to capture a significant share of the large “untapped” biopharmaceutical spending not historically available to biopharmaceutical services companies for example over the past several years we have built dedicated customer relationship teams around each of our largest customers allowing us to proactively help them identify additional ways our services can enable them to further improve their rd productivity and focus on variable cost structures in addition we continue to evolve our relationships with small midsize and other biopharmaceutical customers outside the 20 largest by revenues of which we have over 500 around the world the breadth and depth of our service offerings allow us to develop relationships with key decision makers throughout our customers’ organization we intend to leverage our strong customer relationships to further penetrate new opportunities as our customers seek to reduce and variabalize their cost structures 

 

continue to enable innovative and flexible business solutions we use our extensive scope of services to design innovative and flexible solutions tailored for our customers’ needs in an increasingly complex environment we believe that sustainable and growing revenue can be achieved through differentiation of services coupled with deeper and broader relationships and a commitment to structuring flexible and innovative solutions to meet the diversified and changing needs of the healthcare industry for example in 2013 we entered into a firstofits kind sole provider strategic collaboration for development and clinical trial execution with merck kgaa known as merck serono this new model is designed to leverage the knowledge and insights from both organizations and will span the full spectrum of clinical development from phase i through to postmarketing approvals we also have a historical track record of innovative solutions as demonstrated by an alliance with eisai pharmaceuticals or eisai to conduct 11 proofofconcept studies on six oncology compounds resulting in a relationship that helped eisai extend its capacity and accelerate the development of these compounds at half of eisai’s original budgeted cost we leverage our people processes and technologies to provide significant value to our customers through customized outsourcing shifting more of the responsibility for managing development to us and other arrangements that can save our customers time and money and contribute to our profitable growth 

use our therapeutic scientific and domain expertise to improve outcomes we believe our deep scientific therapeutic and domain expertise enables us to help customers deliver and demonstrate enhanced value for patients and solve the complex challenges inherent in drug development and commercialization for example we recently undertook a study with the participation of united states oncology supported by mckesson specialty health and the us oncology network to explore the operational feasibility and clinical benefits of an upfront approach to the genomic sequencing of tumors from metastatic colorectal cancer patients the study will investigate how preprofiling and genomic sequencing data may support physician treatment decisions including the identification of appropriate clinical trials for patients we also believe that the breadth of our expertise from expert consulting to datadriven planning and design enables us to help biopharmaceutical companies improve operational efficiency and outcomes by transforming processes our thought and scientific leadership in the area of observational research is demonstrated by our leadership role in the good research for comparative effectiveness grace initiative which is developing a core set of good practice principles to address the design conduct analysis and reporting of observational studies of comparative effectiveness we use our therapeutic scientific and domain expertise to help our customers reach optimal outcomes in the everchanging healthcare landscape for example we implemented a program for a large biopharmaceutical company to educate over 670000 patients and staff to increase patient compliance with a customer’s diabetes drug our ability to link observational research patient education and compliance data in diabetes is one example of our ability to connect clinical data to improve outcomes for our customers we leverage our scientific expertise and innovative technologies to improve value for our customers 

leverage our global footprint and presence in significant emerging markets we have some of the broadest global capabilities in the biopharmaceutical services industry with a presence in all of the major biopharmaceutical markets including the united states japan europe and each of the bric countries our extensive global footprint provides us substantial local expertise in multinational patient populations and regulatory schemes that allows us to effectively serve customers worldwide we believe there is a significant opportunity to increase our penetration and grow our revenues in both developed and developing markets as we adapt to meet the evolving needs of the biopharmaceutical industry as it seeks to serve the needs of an expanding and aging global population our business model allows us to react quickly to the unique market needs of multinational biopharmaceutical companies as well as regional and local market participants for example we are able to support our customers in the asiapacific region as well as our global customers with we believe the largest regional workforce which has significant healthcare domain expertise further our revenues in the asiapacific region have increased 10 from 2011 to 2013 we are also able to use our global footprint to help biopharmaceutical companies in developed markets leverage their costs for example we implemented a global monitoring solution based in bangalore india for a united states biopharmaceutical company to provide monitoring for over 1000 products we intend to continue to leverage our global footprint to deliver services broadly and effectively as the needs of our customers evolve 

capitalize on emerging growth opportunities in the broader healthcare market we believe that healthcare stakeholders such as regulatory authorities payers providers and patients are transforming the delivery of healthcare by increasingly seeking evidence to support drug approval reimbursement prescribing and consumption decisions in a manner that will afford us opportunities to use our competitive strengths in new markets including other healthcare services we believe that in the new healthcare landscape payers and providers will increasingly need to measure the value of services and patient outcomes we plan to leverage our deep experience in interventional phase iiibiv trials our broad array of consulting expertise and our observational research capabilities to help meet the increasing need for realworld and late phase research to assist our customers in monitoring safety proving efficacy evaluating benefitrisk demonstrating effectiveness and gaining market access we also plan to continue to focus on integrating data to enable more successful development of compounds and solutions we intend to utilize our existing capabilities to expand our reach into adjacent market opportunities that are complementary to our historical focus 

 

our history 

we were founded in 1982 by dr gillings who was a biostatistics professor at the university of north carolina at chapel hill dr gillings and his cofounder pioneered the use of sophisticated statistical algorithms to improve the quality of data used to determine the efficacy of various drug therapies we expanded internationally into europe in 1987 and into asia in 1993 in 1994 we had grown to over 90 million in revenues and completed an initial public offering or ipo through quintiles transnational corp or quintiles transnational our wholly owned subsidiary through which we conduct our operations as a public company we grew both organically and through acquisitions adding a variety of new capabilities by the end of 1996 we significantly expanded our service offerings by acquiring companies that added commercial and consulting capabilities to our business in september 2003 we completed a going private transaction with quintiles transnational becoming owned by a group of investors that included dr gillings 

in january 2008 quintiles transnational engaged in what we refer to as the major shareholder reorganization which resulted in our ownership by dr gillings and his affiliates funds advised by bain capital partners llc together with their affiliates bain capital affiliates of tpg global llc or the tpg funds we refer to tpg global llc as “tpg global” and together with its affiliates “tpg” affiliates of 3i corporation or 3i and certain other shareholders who participated in the going private transaction and various members of our management 

in december 2009 we completed what we refer to as the holding company reorganization whereby we formed quintiles transnational holdings inc or quintiles holdings as the parent company of quintiles transnational in may 2013 we returned to the public markets by completing an ipo on the new york stock exchange or nyse 

services 

we address the needs of healthcare industry participants by providing product development and integrated healthcare services to help our customers navigate the complex healthcare environment and improve outcomes we can support our biopharmaceutical customers from firstinman trials through patent expiration from strategy through planning and execution we also offer a growing number of services designed to address the outcomes and analytical needs of the broader healthcare industry the broad scope of our services allows us to help our customers rapidly assess the viability of a growing number of potential new therapies costeffectively accelerate development of the most promising ones launch new products to the market quickly and evaluate their impact and appropriate use on patients 

we offer our services through two reportable segments product development and integrated healthcare services the figure below displays the range of our services across both of our segments

customers and marketing 

to provide and coordinate service offerings to our customers we have business development efforts across our service offerings and within many individual service offerings and we also maintain an integrated business development group to foster accountability in key service offering areas each offering area has a designated leader who drives the financial contribution of that offering area these two axes of business development direct the selling and business development personnel in each of our major locations in the united states and throughout europe the asiapacific canada and latin america providing coverage of both multinational and regionaldomestic biopharmaceutical companies 

we take a holistic customeroriented view toward business development our integrated business development group is responsible for assessing our customers’ current and future needs and helping to define the right service offerings to be delivered at the right time this group includes dedicated customer teams that deliver customized solutions from the full breadth and depth of our service offerings for the world’s leading biopharmaceutical companies in addition we continue to evolve our relationships with our small midsize and other biopharmaceutical customers outside the 20 largest biopharmaceutical companies based on 2012 reported revenues 

in 2013 we earned service revenues of over 100 million in seven countries in north america europe and asia please refer to note 20 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further details regarding our foreign and domestic operations in 2013 2012 and 2011 for a discussion of risks attendant to our foreign operations see “risk factors—our business is subject to international economic political and other risks that could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition” 

our service revenues were attributed to our segments as follows 

 

 additional information regarding our segments is presented in note 21 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

no single customer accounted for 100 or more of our consolidated service revenues in 2013 2012 or 2011 in the past we have derived and may in the future derive a significant portion of our service revenues from a relatively limited number of major projects or customers as biopharmaceutical companies continue to outsource large projects andor functions to fewer providers this concentration of business could increase 

competition 

the market for our product development services is highly competitive and we compete against traditional cros the inhouse rd departments of biopharmaceutical companies universities and teaching hospitals among the traditional cros there are severalhundred small limitedservice providers several mediumsized firms and only a few fullservice companies with global capabilities consolidation among cros likely will result in greater competition among the larger cros for customers clinical personnel and acquisition candidates product development’s primary competitors include covance inc pharmaceutical product development inc parexel international corporation icon plc inventiv health inc or inventiv inc research and pra international among others competitive factors for product development services include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 integrated healthcare services competes in the postapproval and commercialization arenas in the postapproval arena our solutions compete against realworld and late phase research providers including boutique firms divisions of biopharmaceutical companies and divisions of traditional cro’s noted above our commercial solutions compete against the inhouse sales and marketing departments of biopharmaceutical companies other contract pharmaceutical sales and service organizations and consulting firms integrated healthcare services’ primary commercial competitors in the united states include inventiv pdi inc and publicis selling solutions outside of the united states integrated healthcare services commercial teams typically compete against single country or more regionally focused commercial service providers such as united drug plc inventiv eps corporation and cmic holdings co ltd in japan the primary competitive factors affecting integrated healthcare services are breadth of service offering and ability to deploy in an integrated manner quality and track record ie the proven ability to quickly assemble train and manage large qualified commercial teams on a global footprint and price 

notwithstanding these competitive factors we believe that the synergies arising from integrating product development services with commercial services supported by global operations data analysis and the ability to form long term strategic alliances with biopharmaceutical companies differentiate us from our competitors 

government regulation 

good clinical practice 

gcp regulations and guidelines contain the industry standards for the conduct of clinical trials with respect to the integrity of the data and safety of the research subjects the fda the european medicines agency or ema and many other regulatory authorities require that study results and data submitted to such authorities be based on trials conducted in accordance with gcp provisions records for clinical trials must be maintained for specified periods for inspection by the fda and other regulators significant noncompliance with gcp requirements can result in the disqualification by regulators of data collected during the clinical trial 

our standard operating procedures related to clinical trials are written in accordance with regulations and guidelines appropriate to the region where they are used thus helping to ensure compliance with gcp fda regulations and guidelines serve as a basis for our north american standard operating procedures within europe we perform our work subject to the ema’s note for guidance “good clinical practice for trials on medicinal products in the european community” all clinical trials other than those defined as “noninternational” to be submitted to the ema must meet the requirements of the international conference on harmonisation gcp standards our offices in the asiapacific region and in latin america have developed standard operating procedures in accordance with their local requirements and in harmony with our north american and european operations 

 

regulation of drugs biologics and medical devices 

in the united states pharmaceutical biological and medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by the fda the federal food drug and cosmetic act or the fdc act the public health service act or the phs act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern among other things the research development testing manufacture storage recordkeeping approval labeling promotion and marketing distribution postapproval monitoring and reporting sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical biological and medical device products failure to comply with applicable united states requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions such as fda refusal to approve a pending new drug application nda for a new drug a biological license application bla for a new biological product or premarket approval pma or clearance for a new medical device warning or untitled letters product recalls product seizures total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions fines civil penalties and criminal prosecution 

before a new drug or biologic may be marketed it must undergo extensive testing and regulatory review to determine that it is safe and effective and be approved by the fda or other regulatory authority even after approval a new pma or pma supplement may be required in the event of a modification to the device its labeling or its manufacturing process 

regulation of patient information 

our information management services relate to the diagnosis and treatment of disease and are therefore subject to substantial governmental regulation in addition the confidentiality of patientspecific information and the circumstances under which such patientspecific records may be released for inclusion in our databases or used in other aspects of our business is heavily regulated federal state and foreign governments are contemplating or have proposed or adopted additional legislation governing the possession use and dissemination of personal data such as personal health information and personal financial data as well as security breach notification rules for loss or theft of such data additional legislation or regulation of this type might among other things require us to implement new security measures and processes or bring within the legislation or regulation deidentified health or other personal data each of which may require substantial expenditures or limit our ability to offer some of our services 

in particular personal healthrelated information is recognized in many countries such as the united states and the european union as a special sensitive category of personal information subject to additional mandatory protections violations of data protection regulations are subject to administrative penalties civil money penalties and criminal prosecution including corporate fines and personal liability 

in order to comply with these evolving laws and regulations we may need to implement new data protection privacy and data security measures which may require us to make substantial expenditures or cause us to discontinue or limit the products and services we offer in addition if we violate applicable laws regulations contractual commitments or other duties relating to the use privacy or security of health information we could be subject to regulatory sanctions civil liability or criminal prosecution or suffer reputational harm and it may be necessary to modify our business practices 

regulation of promotion marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products and medical devices 

our integrated healthcare services are subject to detailed and comprehensive regulation in each geographic market in which we operate such regulation relates among other things to the distribution of drug samples the marketing and promotion of approved products the qualifications of sales representatives and the use of healthcare professionals in sales functions 

in the united states our integrated healthcare services are subject to numerous federal and state laws pertaining to promotional activities involving pharmaceutical products and medical devices such as the fda’s regulations against “offlabel promotion” which require sales representatives to restrict promotion of the approved product they are detailing to the approved labeling for the product and the prescription drug marketing act which imposes licensing personnel record keeping packaging labeling product handling and facility storage and security requirements other federal and state laws prohibit manufacturers suppliers and providers from offering giving or receiving kickbacks or other remuneration in connection with ordering or recommending the purchase or rental of healthcare items and services the sale or distribution of pharmaceutical products and devices is also governed by the united states federal trade commission act and state consumer protection laws we are subject to similar regulations currently in effect in the other countries where we offer integrated healthcare services 

we are also subject to various laws and regulations that may apply to certain drug and device promotional practices including among others various aspects of the medicare program violations of these laws and regulations may result in criminal andor civil penalties including possibly as an “aider and abettor” 

 

regulation of laboratories 

our united states laboratories are subject to licensing and regulation under federal state and local laws relating to hazard communication and employee righttoknow regulations and the safety and health of laboratory employees additionally our united states laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations and licensing requirements relating to the handling storage and disposal of hazardous waste radioactive materials and laboratory specimens including the regulations of the environmental protection agency the nuclear regulatory commission the department of transportation the national fire protection agency and the united states drug enforcement administration or dea the use of controlled substances in testing for drugs with a potential for abuse is regulated in the united states by the dea and by similar regulatory bodies in other parts of the world our united states laboratories using controlled substances for testing purposes are licensed by the dea the regulations of the united states department of transportation public health service and postal service apply to the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens our laboratories also are subject to international air transport association regulations which govern international shipments of laboratory specimens furthermore when the materials are sent to a foreign country the transportation of such materials becomes subject to the laws rules and regulations of such foreign country our laboratories outside the united states are subject to applicable national laws governing matters such as licensing the handling and disposal of medical specimens hazardous waste and radioactive materials as well as the health and safety of laboratory employees 

in addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace the united states occupational safety and health administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers may be exposed to bloodborne pathogens such as hiv and the hepatitis b virus although we believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with such federal state and local laws failure to comply with such laws could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business fines criminal penalties and other enforcement actions 

further laboratories that analyze human blood or other biological samples for the diagnosis and treatment of clinical trial subjects must comply with clia as well as requirements established by various states the failure to meet these requirements may result in civil penalties and suspension or revocation of the clia certification 

intellectual property 

we develop and use a number of proprietary methodologies analytics systems technologies and other intellectual property in the conduct of our business we rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies nondisclosure agreements invention assignments and other contractual arrangements to protect our trade secrets and patent copyright and trademark laws to protect other intellectual property rights we have obtained or applied for more than 60 patents in connection with the development of our proprietary technology systems and processes we have also registered or applied for trademarks and service marks in the united states and a number of foreign countries and our trademark “quintiles ® ” is of material importance to us although the duration of trademark and service mark registrations varies from country to country trademarks and service marks generally may be renewed indefinitely so long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained and so long as they have not been found to have become generic although we believe the ownership of our patents trademarks and service marks is an important factor in our business and that our success does depend in part on the ownership thereof we rely primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of our employees other than our quintiles ® trademark we do not have any material patents trademarks service marks licenses franchises or concessions 

net new business reporting and backlog 

net new business is the value of services awarded during the period from projects under signed contracts letters of intent and in some cases precontract commitments which are supported by written communications and adjusted for contracts that were modified or canceled during the period net new business under sole provider arrangements are recorded over the life of the arrangement as projects are awarded under sole provider arrangements we are considered the exclusive provider for the contracted service or services 

consistent with our methodology for calculating net new business during a particular period backlog represents at a particular point in time future service revenues from work not yet completed or performed under signed contracts letters of intent and in some cases precontract commitments that are supported by written communications once work begins on a project service revenues are recognized over the duration of the project included within backlog at december 31 2013 is approximately 6342 million of backlog that we do not expect to generate revenue in the next 12 months 

 

backlog was as follows 

 

 net new business was as follows 

 

 we believe that backlog and net new business may not be consistent indicators of future revenues because they have been and likely will be affected by a number of factors including the variable size and duration of projects many of which are performed over several years cancellations and changes to the scope of work during the course of projects additionally projects may be terminated or delayed by the customer or delayed by regulatory authorities projects that have been delayed remain in backlog but the timing of the revenue generated may differ from the timing originally expected if a customer cancels an order we may be reimbursed for the costs we have incurred typically however we have no contractual right to the full amount of the revenue reflected in our backlog or net new business contracts in the event of cancellation revenue recognition occurs over extended periods of time and is subject to unanticipated delays fluctuations in our reported backlog and net new business levels also result from the fact that we may receive a small number of relatively large orders in any given reporting period that may be included in our backlog and net new business because of these large orders our backlog and net new business in that reporting period may reach levels that may not be sustained in subsequent reporting periods as we increasingly compete for and enter into large contracts that are more global in nature we expect the rate at which our backlog and net new business convert into revenue to increase or lengthen for more details regarding risks related to our backlog see “risk factors—the relationship of backlog to revenues varies over time” projects that have been delayed remain in backlog but the timing of the revenue generated may differ from the timing originally expected accordingly historical indications of the relationship of backlog and net new business to revenues may not be indicative of the future relationship 

employees 

as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 28200 fulltime equivalent employees in approximately 60 countries comprised approximately of 10400 in the americas 9600 in the europe and africa region and 8200 in the asiapacific region with at least 500 employees in 10 countries around the world as of december 31 2013 product development and integrated healthcare services had approximately 19400 and 7200 fulltime equivalent employees respectively in addition our centralized operationscorporate office had approximately 1600 fulltime equivalent employees 

the success of our business depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified professional scientific and technical staff the level of competition among employers in the united states and overseas for skilled personnel particularly those with phd md or equivalent degrees or training is high we believe that our brand recognition and our multinational presence are an advantage in attracting qualified candidates in addition we believe that the wide range of clinical trials in which we participate allows us to offer broad experience to clinical researchers none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union employees in some of our nonunited states locations are represented by works councils as required by local laws we believe that our relations with our employees are good

most of our customers can terminate our contracts upon 30 to 90 days notice our customers may delay terminate or reduce the scope of our contracts for a variety of reasons beyond our control including but not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result contract terminations delays and alterations are a regular part of our business in the event of termination our contracts often provide for fees for winding down the project but these fees may not be sufficient for us to maintain our margins and termination may result in lower resource utilization rates in addition we may not realize the full benefits of our backlog of contractually committed services if our customers cancel delay or reduce their commitments under our contracts with them which may occur if among other things a customer decides to shift its business to a competitor or revoke our status as a preferred provider thus the loss or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could adversely affect our service revenues and profitability we believe the risk of loss or delay of multiple contracts potentially has greater effect where we are party to broader partnering arrangements with global biopharmaceutical companies 

our financial results may be adversely affected if we underprice our contracts overrun our cost estimates or fail to receive approval for or experience delays in documenting change orders 

most of our contracts are either fee for service contracts or fixedfee contracts our past financial results have been and our future financial results may be adversely impacted if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates and are unable to successfully negotiate a change order change orders typically occur when the scope of work we perform needs to be modified from that originally contemplated by our contract with the customer modifications can occur for example when there is a change in a key trial assumption or parameter or a significant change in timing where we are not successful in converting outofscope work into change orders under our current contracts we bear the cost of the additional work such underpricing significant cost overruns or delay in documentation of change orders could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

 

the relationship of backlog to revenues varies over time 

backlog represents future service revenues from work not yet completed or performed under signed contracts letters of intent and in some cases precontract commitments that are supported by written communications once work begins on a project revenue is recognized over the duration of the project projects may be terminated or delayed by the customer or delayed by regulatory authorities for reasons beyond our control to the extent projects are delayed the timing of our revenue could be affected in the event that a customer cancels a contract we typically would be entitled to receive payment for all services performed up to the cancellation date and subsequent customerauthorized services related to terminating the canceled project typically however we have no contractual right to the full amount of the revenue reflected in our backlog in the event of a contract cancellation the duration of the projects included in our backlog and the related revenue recognition range from a few weeks to many years our backlog may not be indicative of our future revenues and we may not realize all the anticipated future revenue reflected in our backlog a number of factors may affect backlog including 

 

  

  

 our backlog at december 31 2013 was 9855 million compared to backlog of 8704 million at december 31 2012 although an increase in backlog will generally result in an increase in revenues to be recognized over time depending on the level of cancellations an increase in backlog at a particular point in time does not necessarily correspond directly to an increase in revenues during a particular period the extent to which contracts in backlog will result in revenue depends on many factors including but not limited to delivery against projected schedules the need for scope changes change orders contract cancellations and the nature duration size complexity and phase of the contracts each of which factors can vary significantly from time to time our 9855 million of backlog at december 31 2013 included approximately 6342 million of backlog that we do not expect to generate revenue in 2014 as compared to our 8704 million of backlog at december 31 2012 which included approximately 5601 million of backlog that we did not expect to generate revenue in 2013 

the rate at which our backlog converts to revenue may vary over time for a variety of reasons the revenue recognition on larger more global projects could be slower than on smaller less global projects for a variety of reasons including but not limited to an extended period of negotiation between the time the project is awarded to us and the actual execution of the contract as well as an increased timeframe for obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals additionally delayed projects will remain in backlog unless otherwise canceled by the customer and will not generate revenue at the rate originally expected thus the relationship of backlog to realized revenues may vary over time 

our business depends on the continued effectiveness and availability of our information systems including the information systems we use to provide our services to our customers and failures of these systems may materially limit our operations 

due to the global nature of our business and our reliance on information systems to provide our services we intend to increase our use of webenabled and other integrated information systems in delivering our services we also provide access to similar information systems to certain of our customers in connection with the services we provide them as the breadth and complexity of our information systems continue to grow we will increasingly be exposed to the risks inherent in the development integration and ongoing operation of evolving information systems including 

 

  

  

  

the materialization of any of these risks may impede the processing of data the delivery of databases and services and the daytoday management of our business and could result in the corruption loss or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary confidential or other data while we have disaster recovery plans in place they might not adequately protect us in the event of a system failure despite any precautions we take damage from fire floods hurricanes power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses breakins and similar events at our various computer facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to our servers and from our servers to our customers corruption or loss of data may result in the need to repeat a trial at no cost to the customer but at significant cost to us the termination of a contract or damage to our reputation additionally significant delays in system enhancements or inadequate performance of new or upgraded systems once completed could damage our reputation and harm our business finally longterm disruptions in the infrastructure caused by events such as natural disasters the outbreak of war the escalation of hostilities and acts of terrorism particularly involving cities in which we have offices could adversely affect our businesses although we carry property and business interruption insurance our coverage might not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur 

unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential data whether through systems failure or employee negligence fraud or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers similarly we have been and expect that we will continue to be subject to attempts to gain unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our customers whether by our employees or third parties including a cyber attack by computer programmers and hackers who may develop and deploy viruses worms or other malicious software programs to date these attacks have not had a material impact on our operations or financial results nonetheless successful attacks in the future could result in negative publicity significant remediation costs legal liability and damage to our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition our liability insurance might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches cyber attacks and other related breaches 

we may be adversely affected by customer or therapeutic concentration 

although we did not have any customer that represented 10 or more of our service revenues in 2013 2012 or 2011 we derive the majority of our revenues from a number of large customers if any large customer decreases or terminates its relationship with us our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

additionally conducting multiple clinical trials for different customers in a single therapeutic class involving drugs with the same or similar chemical action has in the past and may in the future adversely affect our business if some or all of the trials are canceled because of new scientific information or regulatory judgments that affect the drugs as a class or if industry consolidation results in the rationalization of drug development pipelines similarly marketing and selling drugs for different biopharmaceutical companies with similar chemical actions subjects us to risk if new scientific information or regulatory judgment prejudices the drugs as a class which may lead to compelled or voluntary prescription limitations or withdrawal of some or all of such drugs from the market 

our business is subject to international economic political and other risks that could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we have significant operations in foreign countries that may require complex arrangements to deliver services on global contracts for our customers additionally we have established operations in locations remote from our most developed business centers as a result we are subject to heightened risks inherent in conducting business internationally including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these risks and uncertainties could negatively impact our ability to among other things perform large global projects for our customers furthermore our ability to deal with these issues could be affected by applicable united states laws and the need to protect our assets any such risks could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to successfully develop and market new services or enter new markets our growth results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

a key element of our growth strategy is the successful development and marketing of new services or entering new markets that complement or expand our existing business as we develop new services or enter new markets including services targeted at participants in the broader healthcare industry we may not have or adequately build the competencies necessary to perform such services satisfactorily may not receive market acceptance for such services or may face increased competition if we are unable to succeed in developing new services entering new markets or attracting a customer base for our new services or in new markets we will be unable to implement this element of our growth strategy and our future business reputation results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

upgrading the information systems that support our operating processes and evolving the technology platform for our services pose risks to our business 

continued efficient operation of our business requires that we implement standardized global business processes and evolve our information systems to enable this implementation we have continued to undertake significant programs to optimize business processes with respect to our services our inability to effectively manage the implementation and adapt to new processes designed into these new or upgraded systems in a timely and costeffective manner may result in disruption to our business and negatively affect our operations 

we have entered into agreements with certain vendors to provide systems development and integration services that develop or license to us the it platform for programs to optimize our business processes if such vendors fail to perform as required or if there are substantial delays in developing implementing and updating the it platform our customer delivery may be impaired and we may have to make substantial further investments internally or with third parties to achieve our objectives additionally our progress may be limited by parties with existing or claimed patents who seek to enjoin us from using preferred technology or seek license payments from us 

meeting our objectives is dependent on a number of factors which may not take place as we anticipate including obtaining adequate technologyenabled services creating itenabled services that our customers will find desirable and implementing our business model with respect to these services also increased itrelated expenditures may negatively impact our profitability 

if we fail to perform our services in accordance with contractual requirements regulatory standards and ethical considerations we could be subject to significant costs or liability and our reputation could be harmed 

we contract with biopharmaceutical companies to perform a wide range of services to assist them in bringing new drugs to market our services include monitoring clinical trials data and laboratory analysis electronic data capture patient recruitment and other related services such services are complex and subject to contractual requirements regulatory standards and ethical considerations for example we must adhere to regulatory requirements such as the fda and current gcp glp and gmp requirements if we fail to perform our services in accordance with these requirements regulatory agencies may take action against us for failure to comply with applicable regulations governing clinical trials or sales and marketing practices such actions may include sanctions such as injunctions or failure of such regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of products delay suspension or withdrawal of approvals license revocation product seizures or recalls operational restrictions civil or criminal penalties or prosecutions damages or fines customers may also bring claims against us for breach of our contractual obligations and patients in the clinical trials and patients taking drugs approved on the basis of those trials may bring personal injury claims against us for negligence any such action could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and reputation 

 

such consequences could arise if among other things the following occur 

improper performance of our services the performance of clinical development services is complex and timeconsuming for example we may make mistakes in conducting a clinical trial that could negatively impact or obviate the usefulness of the trial or cause the results of the trial to be reported improperly if the trial results are compromised we could be subject to significant costs or liability which could have an adverse impact on our ability to perform our services as examples 

 

  

  

 large clinical trials can cost hundreds of millions of dollars and while we endeavor to contractually limit our exposure to such risks improper performance of our services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition damage our reputation and result in the cancellation of current contracts by or failure to obtain future contracts from the affected customer or other customers 

interactive response technology malfunction cenduit llc our joint venture with thermo fisher scientific inc or cenduit provides interactive response technology or irt services irt enables the randomization of patients in a given clinical trial to different treatment arms and regulates the supply of an investigational drug all by means of interactive voice response and interactive web response systems if irt malfunctions and as a result patients are incorrectly randomized or supplied with an incorrect drug during the course of the clinical trials then any such event would create a risk of liability to cenduit which could have an adverse impact on the value of our investment in cenduit and could also result in a contractual claim against us for failure to properly perform the clinical trial furthermore negative publicity associated with an irt malfunction could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation additionally errors in randomization may require us to repeat the trial at no further cost to our customer but at a substantial cost to us 

investigation of customers from time to time one or more of our customers are audited or investigated by regulatory authorities or enforcement agencies with respect to regulatory compliance of their clinical trials programs or the marketing and sale of their drugs in these situations we have often provided services to our customers with respect to the clinical trials programs or activities being audited or investigated and we are called upon to respond to requests for information by the authorities and agencies there is a risk that either our customers or regulatory authorities could claim that we performed our services improperly or that we are responsible for clinical trial or program compliance if our customers or regulatory authorities make such claims against us and prove them we could be subject to damages fines or penalties in addition negative publicity regarding regulatory compliance of our customers’ clinical trials programs or drugs could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

insufficient customer funding to complete a clinical trial as noted above clinical trials can cost hundreds of millions of dollars there is a risk that we may initiate a clinical trial for a customer and then the customer becomes unwilling or unable to fund the completion of the trial in such a situation notwithstanding the customer’s ability or willingness to pay for or otherwise facilitate the completion of the trial we may be ethically bound to complete or wind down the trial at our own expense 

our research and development services could subject us to potential liability that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our business involves the testing of new drugs on patients in clinical trials and if marketing approval is granted the availability of these drugs to be prescribed to patients our involvement in the clinical trials and development process creates a risk of liability for personal injury to or death of patients particularly those with lifethreatening illnesses resulting from adverse reactions to the drugs administered during testing or after product launch respectively for example we have from time to time been sued and may be sued in the future by individuals alleging personal injury due to their participation in clinical trials and seeking damages from us under a variety of legal theories although we maintain the types and amounts of insurance customary in the industries and countries in which we operate if we are required to pay damages or incur defense costs in connection with any personal injury claim that is outside the scope of indemnification agreements we have with our customers if any indemnification agreement is not performed in accordance with its terms or if our liability exceeds the amount of any applicable indemnification limits or available insurance coverage our financial condition results of operations and reputation could be materially and adversely affected currently we maintain professional liability insurance including products liability for completed operations coverage with annual aggregate limits in excess of 500 million in the future we may not be able to get adequate insurance for these types of risks at reasonable rates 

 

we also contract with physicians to serve as investigators in conducting clinical trials if the investigators commit errors or make omissions during a clinical trial that result in harm to trial patients or after a clinical trial to a patient using the drug after it has received regulatory approval claims for personal injury or products liability damages may result additionally if the investigators engage in fraudulent behavior trial data may be compromised which may require us to repeat the clinical trial or subject us to liability we do not believe we are legally responsible for the medical care rendered by such thirdparty investigators and we would vigorously defend any claims brought against us however it is possible we could be found liable for claims with respect to the actions of thirdparty investigators 

some of our services involve direct interaction with clinical trial subjects or volunteers and operation of phase i clinical facilities which could create potential liability that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we operate two facilities where phase i clinical trials are conducted which ordinarily involve testing an investigational drug on a limited number of healthy individuals typically 20 to 80 persons to determine such drug’s basic safety failure to operate such a facility in accordance with applicable regulations could result in that facility being shut down which could disrupt our operations additionally we face risks associated with adverse events resulting from the administration of such drugs to healthy volunteers and the professional malpractice of medical care providers occasionally physicians employed at our phase i clinical facilities act as principal investigators in laterphase trials at those same facilities we also directly employ nurses and other trained employees who assist in implementing the testing involved in our clinical trials such as drawing blood from healthy volunteers any professional malpractice or negligence by such investigators nurses or other employees could potentially result in liability to us in the event of personal injury to or death of a healthy volunteer in clinical trials this liability particularly if it were to exceed the limits of any indemnification agreements and insurance coverage we may have may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

our commercial services could result in liability to us if a drug causes harm to a patient while we are generally indemnified and insured against such risks we may still suffer financial losses 

when we market drugs under contract for a biopharmaceutical company we could suffer liability for harm allegedly caused by those drugs either as a result of a lawsuit against the biopharmaceutical company to which we are joined a lawsuit naming us or any of our subsidiaries or an action launched by a regulatory body while we are indemnified by the biopharmaceutical company for the action of the drugs we market on its behalf and we carry insurance to cover harm caused by our negligence in performing services it is possible that we could nonetheless incur financial losses regulatory penalties or both in particular any claim could result in potential liability for us if the claim is outside the scope of the indemnification agreement we have with the biopharmaceutical company the biopharmaceutical company does not abide by the indemnification agreement as required or the liability exceeds the amount of any applicable indemnification limits or available insurance coverage such a finding could have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and reputation furthermore negative publicity associated with harm caused by drugs we helped to market could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

our insurance may not cover all of our indemnification obligations and other liabilities associated with our operations 

we maintain insurance designed to provide coverage for ordinary risks associated with our operations and our ordinary indemnification obligations with annual aggregate limits in excess of 500 million the coverage provided by such insurance may not be adequate for all claims we may make or may be contested by our insurance carriers if our insurance is not adequate or available to pay liabilities associated with our operations or if we are unable to purchase adequate insurance at reasonable rates in the future our profitability may be adversely impacted 

if we are unable to attract suitable investigators and patients for our clinical trials our clinical development business might suffer 

the recruitment of investigators and patients for clinical trials is essential to our business investigators are typically located at hospitals clinics or other sites and supervise the administration of the investigational drug to patients during the course of a clinical trial patients generally include people from the communities in which the clinical trials are conducted our clinical development business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract suitable and willing investigators or patients for clinical trials on a consistent basis for example if we are unable to engage investigators to conduct clinical trials as planned or enroll sufficient patients in clinical trials we might need to expend additional funds to obtain access to resources or else be compelled to delay or modify the clinical trial plans which may result in additional costs to us 

 

if we lose the services of key personnel or are unable to recruit experienced personnel our business could be adversely affected 

our success substantially depends on the collective performance contributions and expertise of our senior management team and other key personnel including qualified management professional scientific and technical operating staff and qualified sales representatives for our contract sales services there is significant competition for qualified personnel particularly those with higher educational degrees such as a medical degree a phd or an equivalent degree in the biopharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical services industries the departure of any key executive or our inability to continue to identify attract and retain qualified personnel or replace any departed personnel in a timely fashion may impact our ability to grow our business and compete effectively in our industry and may negatively affect our ability to meet financial and operational goals 

exchange rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial condition 

in 2013 approximately 378 of our service revenues were denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar because a large portion of our service revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar and our financial statements are reported in united states dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition exchange rate fluctuations between local currencies and the united states dollar create risk in several ways including 

foreign currency translation risk the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies and translated into united states dollars for financial reporting purposes accordingly exchange rate fluctuations will affect the translation of foreign results into united states dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated results 

foreign currency transaction risk we are subject to foreign currency transaction risk for fluctuations in exchange rates during the period of time between the consummation and cash settlement of a transaction we earn revenue from our service contracts over a period of several months and in some cases over several years accordingly exchange rate fluctuations during this period may affect our profitability with respect to such contracts 

we may limit these risks through exchange rate fluctuation provisions stated in our service contracts or we may hedge our transaction risk with foreign currency exchange contracts or options we have not however hedged 100 of our foreign currency transaction risk and we may experience fluctuations in financial results from our operations outside the united states and foreign currency transaction risk associated with our service contracts 

disruptions in the credit and capital markets and unfavorable general economic conditions could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

disruptions in the credit and capital markets could have negative effects on our business that may be difficult to predict or anticipate including the ability of our customers vendors contractors and financing sources to meet their contractual obligations although we are unable to quantify the impact it has had on us we are aware of a limited number of instances during the past several years where cancellations changes in scope and failure to pay timely were attributable at least in part to difficulty in our customers’ ability to obtain financing in the future such actions by our customers could if they involve a significant amount of business with us have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our effective income tax rate may fluctuate which may adversely affect our operations earnings and earnings per share 

our effective income tax rate is influenced by our projected profitability in the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate changes in the distribution of profits and losses among taxing jurisdictions may have a significant impact on our effective income tax rate which in turn could have an adverse effect on our net income and earnings per share factors that may affect our effective income tax rate include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

these changes may cause fluctuations in our effective income tax rate that could adversely affect our results of operations and cause fluctuations in our earnings and earnings per share 

we have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights and these rights are important to our success 

our success depends in part upon our ability to develop use and protect our proprietary methodologies analytics systems technologies and other intellectual property existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights and the protection in some countries may be very limited we rely upon a combination of trade secrets confidentiality policies nondisclosure invention assignment and other contractual arrangements and patent copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights these laws are subject to change at any time and certain agreements may not be fully enforceable which could further restrict our ability to protect our innovations our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing services similar to or duplicative of ours further the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors former employees or other third parties and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights enforcing our rights might also require considerable time money and oversight and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights 

depending on the circumstances we might need to grant a specific customer greater rights in intellectual property developed in connection with a contract than we otherwise generally do in certain situations we might forego all rights to the use of intellectual property we create which would limit our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other customers any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenuegenerating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop or license new or modified solutions for future projects 

our relationships with existing or potential customers who are in competition with each other may adversely impact the degree to which other customers or potential customers use our services which may adversely affect our results of operations 

the biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive with biopharmaceutical companies each seeking to persuade payers providers and patients that their drug therapies are better and more costeffective than competing therapies marketed or being developed by competing firms in addition to the adverse competitive interests that biopharmaceutical companies have with each other biopharmaceutical companies also have adverse interests with respect to drug selection and reimbursement with other participants in the healthcare industry including payers and providers biopharmaceutical companies also compete to be first to market with new drug therapies we regularly provide services to biopharmaceutical companies who compete with each other and we sometimes provide services or funding to such customers regarding competing drugs in development our existing or future relationships with our biopharmaceutical customers may therefore deter other biopharmaceutical customers from using our services or may result in our customers seeking to place limits on our ability to serve other biopharmaceutical industry participants in addition our further expansion into the broader healthcare market may adversely impact our relationships with biopharmaceutical customers and such customers may elect not to use our services reduce the scope of services that we provide to them or seek to place restrictions on our ability to serve customers in the broader healthcare market with interests that are adverse to theirs any loss of customers or reductions in the level of revenues from a customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations business and prospects 

if we are unable to successfully identify acquire and integrate existing businesses services and technologies our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 

we anticipate that a portion of our future growth may come from acquiring existing businesses services or technologies the success of any acquisition will depend upon among other things our ability to effectively integrate acquired personnel operations products and technologies into our business and to retain the key personnel and customers of our acquired businesses in addition we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or obtain any necessary financing on commercially acceptable terms we may also spend time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition targets but not complete the transaction any future acquisition could involve other risks including among others the assumption of additional liabilities and expenses difficulties and expenses in connection with integrating the acquired companies and achieving the expected benefits issuances of potentially dilutive securities or interestbearing debt loss of key employees of the acquired companies transaction costs diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and with respect to the acquisition of foreign companies the inability to overcome differences in foreign business practices language and customs our failure to identify potential acquisitions complete targeted acquisitions and integrate completed acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

investments in our customers’ businesses or drugs and our related commercial rights strategies could have a negative impact on our financial performance 

we may enter into arrangements with our customers or other drug companies in which we take on some of the risk of the potential success or failure of their businesses or drugs including making strategic investments in our customers or other drug companies providing financing to customers or other drug companies or acquiring an interest in the revenues from customers’ drugs or in entities developing a limited number of drugs as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 420 million of such arrangements and we were also committed to invest an additional 342 million in the novaquest pharma opportunities fund iii lp or the fund a private equity fund that seeks to enter into similar riskbased arrangements our financial results would be adversely affected if these investments or the underlying drugs result in losses or do not achieve the level of success that we anticipate andor our return or payment from the drug investment or financing is less than our direct and indirect costs with respect to these arrangements 

our results of operations may be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our goodwill and intangible assets 

as of december 31 2013 we had goodwill and net intangible assets of 7077 million which constituted approximately 231 of our total assets at the end of this period we assess the realizability of our indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill annually and conduct an interim evaluation whenever events or changes in circumstances such as operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset indicate that these assets may be impaired our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of the businesses we have acquired which in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses into our own business if we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets such impairment charges could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we face risks arising from the restructuring of our operations 

from time to time we have adopted restructuring plans to improve our operating efficiency through various means such as reduction of overcapacity elimination of nonbillable support roles or other realignment of resources for example in february 2013 our board approved a restructuring plan of up to 150 million that is expected to result in a reduction of approximately 400 positions we recognized approximately 142 million of total restructuring costs related to this plan in 2013 in may 2012 our board approved a restructuring plan of up to 200 million that resulted in the reduction of approximately 280 positions primarily in europe restructuring presents significant potential risks of events occurring that could adversely affect us including a decrease in employee morale the failure to achieve targeted cost savings and the failure to meet operational targets and customer requirements due to the loss of employees and any work stoppages that might occur 

we depend on third parties for critical support services 

we depend on third parties for support services vital to our business such support services include but are not limited to thirdparty transportation providers suppliers of drugs for patients participating in clinical trials suppliers of kits for use in our central laboratory business suppliers of reagents for use in our testing equipment and providers of maintenance contracts for our equipment the failure of any of these third parties to adequately provide the critical support services could have a material adverse effect on our business 

risks relating to our industry 

the biopharmaceutical services industry is highly competitive 

the biopharmaceutical services industry is highly competitive we often compete for business with other biopharmaceutical services companies internal discovery departments development departments and sales and marketing departments within our customers some of which could be considered large biopharmaceutical services companies in their own right with greater resources than ours we also compete with universities and teaching hospitals if we do not compete successfully our business will suffer the industry is highly fragmented with numerous smaller specialized companies and a handful of fullservice companies with global capabilities similar to ours increased competition has led to price and other forms of competition such as acceptance of less favorable contract terms that could adversely affect our operating results as a result of competitive pressures in recent years our industry has experienced consolidation and “going private” transactions this trend is likely to produce more competition from the resulting larger companies and ones without the cost pressures of being public for both customers and acquisition candidates in addition there are few barriers to entry for smaller specialized companies considering entering the industry because of their size and focus these companies might compete effectively against larger companies such as us which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

 

outsourcing trends in the biopharmaceutical industry and changes in aggregate spending and rd budgets could adversely affect our operating results and growth rate 

economic factors and industry trends that affect biopharmaceutical companies affect our business biopharmaceutical companies continue to seek longterm strategic collaborations with global cros with favorable pricing terms competition for these collaborations is intense and we may decide to forego an opportunity or we may not be selected in which case a competitor may enter into the collaboration and our business with the customer if any may be limited in addition if the biopharmaceutical industry reduces its outsourcing of clinical trials and sales and marketing projects or such outsourcing fails to grow at projected rates our operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected we may also be negatively impacted by consolidation and other factors in the biopharmaceutical industry which may slow decision making by our customers or result in the delay or cancellation of clinical trials our commercial services may be affected by reductions in new drug launches and increases in the number of drugs losing patent protection all of these events could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may be affected by healthcare reform and potential additional reforms 

in march 2010 the united states congress enacted healthcare reform legislation intended to expand over time health insurance coverage and impose health industry cost containment measures this legislation may significantly impact the biopharmaceutical industry in addition numerous government bodies are considering or have adopted various healthcare reforms and may undertake or are in the process of undertaking efforts to control growing healthcare costs through legislation regulation and voluntary agreements with medical care providers and biopharmaceutical companies we are uncertain as to the effects of these recent reforms on our business and are unable to predict what legislative proposals if any will be adopted in the future if regulatory cost containment efforts limit the profitability of new drugs our customers may reduce their rd spending or promotional marketing and sales expenditures which could reduce the business they outsource to us similarly if regulatory requirements are relaxed or simplified drug approval procedures are adopted the demand for our services could decrease 

government bodies may also adopt healthcare legislation or regulations that are more burdensome than existing regulations for example product safety concerns and recommendations by the drug safety oversight board could change the regulatory environment for drug products and new or heightened regulatory requirements may increase our expenses or limit our ability to offer some of our services additionally new or heightened regulatory requirements may have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to conduct industrysponsored clinical trials which could reduce the need for our services 

actions by government regulators or customers to limit a prescription’s scope or withdraw an approved drug from the market could adversely affect our business and result in a loss of revenues 

government regulators have the authority after approving a drug to limit its scope of prescription or withdraw it from the market completely based on safety concerns similarly customers may act to voluntarily limit the scope of prescription of drugs or withdraw them from the market in the past we have provided services with respect to drugs that have been limited andor withdrawn if we are providing services to customers for drugs that are limited or withdrawn we may be required to narrow the scope of or terminate our services with respect to such drugs which would prevent us from earning the full amount of service revenues anticipated under the related service contracts with negative impacts to our financial results 

current and proposed laws and regulations regarding the protection of personal data could result in increased risks of liability or increased cost to us or could limit our service offerings 

the confidentiality collection use and disclosure of personal data including clinical trial patientspecific information are subject to governmental regulation generally in the country that the personal data were collected or used for example united states federal regulations under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa require individuals’ written authorization in addition to any required informed consent before protected health information may be used for research and such regulations specify standards for deidentifications and for limited data sets we are both directly and indirectly affected by the privacy provisions surrounding individual authorizations because many investigators with whom we are involved in clinical trials are directly subject to them as a hipaa “covered entity” and because we obtain identifiable health information from third parties that are subject to such regulations because of amendments to the hipaa data security and privacy rules that were promulgated on january 25 2013 and effective march 26 2013 there are some instances where we are a hipaa “business associate” of a “covered entity” so that we will be directly liable for mishandling protected health information these amendments will subject us to hipaa’s enforcement scheme which as amended can yield up to 15 million in annual civil penalties for each hipaa violation 

 

in the european union or eu personal data includes any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person with health information carrying additional obligations including obtaining the explicit consent from the individual for collection use or disclosure of the information in addition we are subject to eu rules with respect to crossborder transfers of such data out of the eu the united states the eu and its member states and other countries where we have operations such as japan continue to issue new privacy and data protection rules and regulations that relate to personal data and health information failure to comply with certain certificationregistration and annual recertificationregistration provisions associated with these data protection and privacy regulations and rules in various jurisdictions or to resolve any serious privacy complaints could subject us to regulatory sanctions criminal prosecution or civil liability federal state and foreign governments are contemplating or have proposed or adopted additional legislation governing the collection possession use or dissemination of personal data such as personal health information and personal financial data as well as security breach notification rules for loss or theft of such data additional legislation or regulation of this type might among other things require us to implement new security measures and processes or bring within the legislation or regulation deidentified health or other personal data each of which may require substantial expenditures or limit our ability to offer some of our services additionally if we violate applicable laws regulations or duties relating to the use privacy or security of personal data we could be subject to civil liability or criminal prosecution be forced to alter our business practices and suffer reputational harm in the next few years the european data protection framework may be revised as a generally applicable data regulation the text has not yet been finalized but it contains new provisions specifically directed at the processing of health information sanctions of up to 5 of worldwide gross revenue and extraterritoriality measures intended to bring noneu companies under the proposed regulation 

if we do not keep pace with rapid technological changes our services may become less competitive or obsolete 

the biopharmaceutical industry generally and drug development and clinical research more specifically are subject to rapid technological changes our current competitors or other businesses might develop technologies or services that are more effective or commercially attractive than or render obsolete our current or future technologies and services if our competitors introduce superior technologies or services and if we cannot make enhancements to remain competitive our competitive position would be harmed if we are unable to compete successfully we may lose customers or be unable to attract new customers which could lead to a decrease in our revenue and financial condition 

the biopharmaceutical industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and we might be involved in costly intellectual property lawsuits 

the biopharmaceutical industry has a history of intellectual property litigation and these lawsuits will likely continue in the future accordingly we may face patent infringement suits by companies that have patents for similar business processes or other suits alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights legal proceedings relating to intellectual property could be expensive take significant time and divert management’s attention from other business concerns regardless of the outcome of the litigation if we do not prevail in an infringement lawsuit brought against us we might have to pay substantial damages and we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license to use technology on unfavorable terms 

risks relating to our indebtedness 

our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial condition 

as of december 31 2013 we had 3067 billion in total assets 3734 billion in total liabilities and a shareholders’ deficit of 667 million included within total liabilities was 2046 billion of total indebtedness excluding 3000 million of additional available borrowings under our revolving credit facility our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and thus make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our credit facilities if our cash flow is not sufficient to service our debt and adequately fund our business we may be required to seek further additional financing or refinancing or dispose of assets we may not be able to influence any of these alternatives on satisfactory terms or at all our substantial indebtedness could also 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 despite our level of indebtedness we are able to incur more debt and undertake additional obligations incurring such debt or undertaking such additional obligations could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition 

although our credit agreement which governs the quintiles transnational senior credit facilities contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could increase we have approximately 3000 million available for borrowing under our senior secured revolving credit facility 

while the credit agreement also contains restrictions on our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to make loans and investments these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the investments incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 

if we do not comply with the covenants governing our credit facilities we may not have the funds necessary to pay all of our indebtedness that could become due 

the credit agreement governing our credit facilities requires us to comply with certain covenants in particular our credit agreement prohibits us from incurring any additional indebtedness except in specified circumstances or amending the terms of agreements relating to certain existing junior indebtedness if any in a manner materially adverse to the lenders under our credit agreement without lender approval further our credit agreement contains customary covenants including covenants that restrict our ability to acquire and dispose of assets engage in mergers or reorganizations pay dividends or make investments in addition our credit agreement requires us to make mandatory principal prepayments in certain circumstances including with a portion of our excess cash flow if quintiles transnational’s total leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement exceeds certain levels a violation of any of these covenants could cause an event of default under our credit agreement 

if we default on our credit agreement as a result of our failure to pay principal or interest when due our material breach of any representation warranty or covenant or any other reason all outstanding amounts could become immediately due and payable in such case we may not have sufficient funds to repay all the outstanding amounts in addition or in the alternative the lenders under our credit agreement could exercise their rights under the security documents entered into in connection with the credit agreement any acceleration of amounts due under the credit agreement governing our outstanding indebtedness or the substantial exercise by the lenders of their rights under the security documents would likely have a material adverse effect on us 

interest rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial condition 

because we have variable rate debt fluctuations in interest rates affect our business we attempt to minimize interest rate risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps we have entered into interest rate swaps with financial institutions that have reset dates and critical terms that match those of our term loan credit facility accordingly any change in market value associated with the interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 2061 billion of total indebtedness with variable interest at the greater of the three month libor or 125 plus 250 or 375 at december 31 2013 of which 9450 million or 459 was hedged at a fixed rate of 255 leaving approximately 1116 billion of unhedged variable rate debt because we do not attempt to hedge all of our variable rate debt we may incur higher interest costs for the portion of our variable rate debt which is not hedged each quarterpoint increase or decrease in the variable interest rate would result in our interest expense changing by approximately 28 million per year under our unhedged variable rate debt 

 

risks relating to ownership of our common stock 

the parties to the shareholders agreement have significant influence over us including control over decisions that require the approval of our shareholders which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to shareholders for a vote 

we and certain of our shareholders are party to a shareholders agreement dated january 22 2008 as amended or the shareholders agreement the shareholders party to the shareholders agreement beneficially owned approximately 65 of our common stock as of february 6 2014 the shareholders agreement among other things requires such shareholders to vote in favor of certain nominees to our board as long as this group owns or controls at least a majority of our outstanding voting power it has the ability to exercise substantial control over all corporate actions requiring shareholder approval irrespective of how our other shareholders may vote including 

 

  

  

 we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the nyse rules and as a result qualify for and rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements our shareholders do not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to such requirements 

the parties to the shareholders agreement control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock as a result we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of the nyse under these rules a company of which more than 50 of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual group or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements including the requirements that within one year of the date of the listing of our common stock 

 

  

  

 because we utilize these exemptions we do not have a majority of independent directors on our board in addition our compensation and talent development committee and our governance quality and nominating committee do not consist entirely of independent directors and are not subject to annual performance evaluations accordingly our shareholders do not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the nyse 

provisions of our corporate governance documents could make an acquisition of our company more difficult and may prevent attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management even if beneficial to our shareholders 

provisions of our articles of incorporation and our bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a merger acquisition or other change in control of our company that shareholders may consider favorable including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock thereby depressing the market price of our common stock in addition these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for shareholders to replace members of our board because our board is responsible for appointing the members of our management team these provisions could in turn affect any attempt to replace current members of our management team among others these provisions include 1 our ability to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval 2 the requirement that our shareholders may not act without a meeting 3 requirements for advance notification of shareholder nominations and proposals contained in our bylaws 4 the absence of cumulative voting for our directors 5 requirements for shareholder approval of certain business combinations and 6 the limitations on director nominations contained in our shareholders agreement 

our operating results and share price may be volatile which could cause the value of our shareholders’ investments to decline 

our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future and such fluctuations may be significant in addition securities markets worldwide have experienced and are likely to continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could subject the market price of our shares to wide price fluctuations regardless of our operating performance our operating results and the trading price of our shares may fluctuate in response to various factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these and other factors many of which are beyond our control may cause our operating results and the market price for our shares to fluctuate substantially while we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares and may otherwise negatively affect the market price and liquidity of our shares in addition in the past when the market price of a stock has been volatile holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock if any of our shareholders brought a lawsuit against us we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation 

there may be sales of a substantial amount of our common stock by our current shareholders and these sales could cause the price of our common stock to fall 

as of february 6 2014 there were 129842707 shares of common stock outstanding approximately 65 of our outstanding common stock is held by parties to the shareholders agreement 

sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales will occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for us to raise funds through securities offerings in the future 

shareholders that are a party to an amended and restated registration rights agreement or the registration rights agreement may require us to register their shares for resale under the federal securities laws under the registration rights agreement we are required to pay the registration expenses associated with the registration of such shares not including the underwriting discounts commissions and transfer taxes registration of those shares would allow those shareholders to immediately resell their shares in the public market any such sales or the anticipation of such sales may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

since we have no current plans to pay regular cash dividends on our common stock shareholders may not receive any return on investment unless they sell their common stock for a price greater than that which they paid for it 

although we have previously declared dividends to our shareholders we do not currently anticipate paying any regular cash dividends on our common stock any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board and will depend on among other things our results of operations financial condition cash requirements contractual restrictions and other factors that our board may deem relevant in addition our ability to pay dividends is and may be limited by covenants of existing and any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur including under our existing credit facilities therefore any return on investment in our common stock is solely dependent upon the appreciation of the price of our common stock on the open market which may not occur see part ii item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities—policy” for more detail 

 

our amended and restated articles of incorporation contain a provision renouncing any interest and expectancy in certain corporate opportunities identified by certain of our affiliates even if such corporate opportunities are ones that we might reasonably be deemed to have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue 

our amended and restated articles of incorporation provide for the allocation of certain corporate opportunities between us on the one hand and certain of our shareholders on the other hand as set forth in our amended and restated articles of incorporation neither such shareholders nor any director officer shareholder member manager or employee of such shareholders have any fiduciary duty or any other duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate to the full extent permitted by applicable law we have renounced any interest or expectancy in or in being offered an opportunity to participate in business opportunities that are from time to time presented to certain of our shareholders even if the opportunity is one that we might reasonably deem to have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so and each such shareholders shall have no duty to communicate or offer such business opportunity to us and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law shall not be liable to us or to the extent applicable any of its or their shareholders for breach of any fiduciary or other duty as a director or officer or otherwise by reason of the fact that such shareholders pursues or acquires such business opportunity directs such business opportunity to another person or fails to present such business opportunity or information regarding such business opportunity to us therefore a director or officer of our company who also serves as a director officer member manager or employee of such shareholders may pursue certain business opportunities including acquisitions that may be complementary to our business and as a result such opportunities may not be available to us these potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects if attractive corporate opportunities are allocated by such shareholders to themselves or their other affiliates instead of to us

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business includes forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties you should read the “risk factors” section of this annual report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forwardlooking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 

overview 

our business is currently organized in two reportable segments product development and integrated healthcare services 

product development 

product development provides services and expertise that allow biopharmaceutical companies to outsource the clinical development process from firstinman trials to postlaunch monitoring our comprehensive service offering provides the support and functional expertise necessary at each stage of development as well as the systems and analytical capabilities to help our customers improve product development efficiency and effectiveness product development is comprised of clinical solutions and services and consulting clinical solutions and services provides services necessary to develop biopharmaceutical products these services include project management and clinical monitoring functions for conducting multisite trials generally phase iiiv collectively “core clinical” these also include clinical trial support services that improve clinical trial decisionmaking such as global laboratories data management biostatistical safety and pharmacovigilance early clinical development trials generally phase i and strategic planning and design services which help improve decisions and performance consulting provides strategy and management consulting services based on life science expertise and advanced analytics as well as regulatory and compliance consulting services 

on september 16 2013 we completed the acquisition of novella for approximately 1466 million in cash net of approximately 262 million of acquired cash plus potential earnout payments totaling up to 210 million contingent upon the achievement of certain revenue and net new business targets for approximately three years following closing 

integrated healthcare services 

integrated healthcare services provides the healthcare industry with both broad geographic presence and commercial capabilities our customized commercialization services are designed to accelerate the commercial success of biopharmaceutical and other healthrelated products integrated healthcare services provides a broad array of services including commercial services such as providing contract pharmaceutical sales forces in key geographic markets as well as a growing number of healthcare business services for the broader healthcare sector service offerings include commercial services sales representatives strategy marketing communications and other areas related to commercialization outcome research drug therapy analysis realworld research and evidencebased medicine including research studies to prove a drug’s value and other healthcare services comparative and costeffectiveness research capabilities clinical management analytics decision support services medication adherence and health outcome optimization services and webbased systems for measuring quality improvement 

industry outlook 

the potential of the cro market served by product development is primarily a function of two variables biopharmaceutical rd spending and the proportion of this spending that is outsourced outsourcing penetration despite continued softness in the economy and concern about global credit markets we expect outsourced clinical development to cros to grow 68 annually from 2013 to 2016 of this annual growth we believe that up to 2 will be derived from increased rd expenditures with the remainder coming from increased outsourcing penetration we estimate that overall outsourcing penetration in 2013 was 37 we believe that our customers will continue to outsource a greater part of their activities to transform their value chain away from a vertically integrated model and focus on their core competencies to lower risk and improve return with a focus on selecting outsourcing partners that are able to demonstrate the ability to provide flexible and efficient delivery models that leverage patient data to help biopharmaceutical companies deliver more effective patient outcomes we believe that increased demand will create new opportunities for biopharmaceutical services companies particularly those with a global reach 

 

integrated healthcare services historically has focused on biopharmaceutical companies seeking to commercialize their products the total market served by integrated healthcare services is diverse which makes it difficult to estimate the current amount of outsourced integrated healthcare services and the expected growth in such services however based on our knowledge of these markets we believe that while the rate of outsourcing penetration varies by market within integrated healthcare services the overall outsourcing penetration of the estimated 94 billion addressable market is not more than 20 we believe that the market for realworld and late phase research and other healthcare services will evolve and expand and as a result there will be opportunities to grow our revenues and expand our service offerings including to payers who are looking to improve the costeffectiveness of drug therapies and providers who are looking to make evidencebased decisions regarding treatment decisions as business models continue to evolve in the healthcare sector we believe that the growth rate for outsourcing across the integrated healthcare services markets will be similar to the growth in clinical development 

acquisitions 

we completed a number of acquisitions in 2011 2012 and 2013 to enhance our capabilities and offerings in certain areas in october 2011 we acquired outcome for approximately 1649 million net of approximately 121 million of acquired cash to strengthen our late phase research offerings and vcga inc and its wholly owned subsidiary vcg bio inc or collectively vcg for 87 million to strengthen our commercial services in november 2011 we acquired advion bioservices inc for 549 million to enhance our biomarker and other advanced testing capabilities in august 2012 we acquired expression analysis for 397 million to enhance our genetic sequencing and advanced bioinformatics expertise in september 2013 we acquired novella for approximately 1466 million net of approximately 262 million of acquired cash with contingent consideration of up to 210 million to complement our clinical service offerings through its focus on emerging companies and by adding expertise in oncology and medical devices see note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information with respect to these acquisitions the results of operations of acquired businesses have been included since the date of acquisition and were not significant to our consolidated results of operations 

sources of revenue 

total revenues are comprised of service revenues and revenues from reimbursed expenses service revenues primarily include the revenue we earn from providing product development and commercialization services to our customers with product development services representing 767 of our 2013 service revenues and commercialization services representing 222 of our 2013 service revenues our service revenues also include or have historically included product sales and commercial rights and royalties revenues product sales which are approximately 1 or less of consolidated service revenues for all periods presented represent sales of pharmaceutical products pursuant to distribution agreements reimbursed expenses are comprised principally of payments to physicians investigators who oversee clinical trials and travel expenses for our clinical monitors and sales representatives reimbursed expenses may fluctuate from periodtoperiod due in part to where we are in the lifecycle of the many contracts that are in progress at a particular point in time for instance these passthrough costs tend to be higher during the early phases of clinical trials as a result of patient recruitment efforts as reimbursed expenses are passthrough costs to our customers with little to no profit and we believe that the fluctuations from period to period are not meaningful to our underlying performance we do not provide analysis of the fluctuations in these items or their impact on our financial results 

costs and expenses 

our costs and expenses are comprised primarily of our costs of revenues and selling general and administrative expenses 

our costs of revenues consist of service costs and reimbursed expenses service costs include compensation and benefits for billable employees depreciation of assets used in generating revenue and other expenses directly related to service contracts such as courier fees laboratory supplies professional services travel expenses and the cost of products sold under distribution agreements as noted above reimbursed expenses are comprised principally of payments to physicians investigators who oversee clinical trials and travel expenses for our clinical monitors and sales representatives 

selling general and administrative expenses include costs related to administrative functions including compensation and benefits travel professional services training and expenses for advertising it facilities and depreciation and amortization 

foreign currency fluctuations 

the impact from foreign currency fluctuations and constant currency information assumes constant foreign currency exchange rates based on the rates in effect for the comparable prioryear period were used in translation we believe that providing the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on certain financial results can facilitate analysis of periodtoperiod comparisons of business performance 

 

results of operations 

year ended december 31 2013 compared to the year ended december 31 2012 and the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 

backlog and net new business 

we began 2013 with backlog in place at the beginning of the year of 8704 million which was 9 higher than at the beginning of 2012 

net new business as defined under “net new business reporting and backlog” in part i item 1 of this report grew 9 in 2013 to 4899 million from 4501 million in 2012 driven by growth in both product development and integrated healthcare services product development’s net new business increased 9 to 3772 million in 2013 as compared to 3474 million in 2012 led by increases in core clinical in north america and europe including projects awarded under two sole provider arrangements signed in 2013 and data management services which benefited from functional resourcing and the sole provider arrangements signed during 2013 integrated healthcare services’ net new business grew 10 in 2013 to 1127 million from 1027 million in 2012 due to an increase in north america and europe 

net new business grew 11 in 2012 to 4501 million of which 1507 million was generated in the fourth quarter from 4044 million in 2011 with the growth driven by product development product development’s net new business increased 14 to 3474 million in 2012 of which 1088 million was generated in the fourth quarter as compared to 3040 million in 2011 led by increases in core clinical in europe and north america and increases in our late phase global laboratory and consulting service offerings factors contributing to product development’s net new business growth in 2012 included increases in our core clinical service offerings in europe and north america resulting from overall growth in those markets our ability to leverage our expanding breadth of service offerings in late phase as well as global laboratories due in part to acquisitions made in 2011 and 2012 and net new business for consulting services related to assisting a customer on a regulatory compliance project these increases were partially offset by lower net new business in the asiapacific and latin america and from our early clinical development service offerings integrated healthcare services’ net new business was 1027 million and 1004 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively 

our backlog at december 31 2013 was 9855 million compared to backlog of 8704 million at december 31 2012 although an increase in backlog will generally result in an increase in revenues to be recognized over time depending on the level of contract modifications an increase in backlog at a particular point in time does not necessarily correspond directly to an increase in revenues during a particular period the extent to which contracts in backlog will result in revenue depends on many factors including but not limited to delivery against projected schedules the need for scope changes change orders contract cancellations and the nature duration size complexity and phase of the contracts each of which factors can vary significantly from time to time our 9855 million of backlog at december 31 2013 included approximately 6342 million of backlog that we do not expect to generate revenue in 2014 as compared to our 8704 million of backlog at december 31 2012 which included approximately 5601 million of backlog that we did not expect to generate revenue in 2013 our ability to grow revenues in the near term at rates comparable to our recent historical results will depend on many factors including but not limited to the factors affecting the rate at which revenues are derived from backlog continued growth in net new business that will generate revenue and factors not within our control such as economic conditions and trends in the industry in which we do business 

service revenues 

 

 in 2013 our service revenues increased 1160 million or 31 as compared to 2012 this increase is comprised of constant currency revenue growth of approximately 1866 million or 51 partially offset by a negative impact of approximately 706 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency revenue growth which includes the impact from business combinations completed in 2012 and 2013 is comprised of a 2146 million increase in product development partially offset by a decrease of 280 million in integrated healthcare services 

 

in 2012 our service revenues increased 3973 million or 121 as compared to 2011 this increase is comprised of constant currency revenue growth of approximately 4590 million or 139 partially offset by a negative impact of approximately 617 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency revenue growth resulted from a 3286 million increase in product development and a 1304 million increase in integrated healthcare services 

service costs 

 

 when compared to 2012 service costs in 2013 increased 121 million the increase included a constant currency increase in expenses of approximately 851 million or 35 partially offset by a positive impact of approximately 730 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency service costs growth was due to annual merit increases in compensation and related expenses partially offset by cost efficiencies gained from restructuring actions taken in prior years as well as incremental costs resulting from the business combinations completed in 2012 and 2013 these increases were partially offset by a decline in other expenses directly related to our service contracts as well as by a reduction of an accrual for statutory profit sharing of approximately 54 million as a result of guidance handed down by an administrative court in france 

when compared to 2011 service costs in 2012 increased 3064 million the increase included a constant currency increase in expenses of approximately 3751 million or 174 partially offset by a positive impact of approximately 688 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuations the constant currency service costs growth was due to an increase in compensation and related expenses and other expenses directly related to our service contracts as well as incremental costs resulting from the business combinations completed in 2011 and 2012 the increase in compensation and related expenses was primarily as a result of a growthrelated increase in billable headcount annual merit increases and an increase in incentive compensation also contributing to the increase in costs of service revenues was a 167 million reduction in the benefit from rd grants received from france and austria an increase in third party costs primarily related to a new agreement to distribute pharmaceutical products in italy and various other individually insignificant factors 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

 the 428 million increase in selling general and administrative expenses in 2013 was caused by a constant currency increase of 591 million or 72 partially offset by a decrease of 163 million from a positive foreign currency impact the constant currency increase was primarily due to 1 expenses incurred related to a 250 million fee paid in connection with the termination of our management agreement with affiliates of certain of our shareholders and a 15 million fee paid in connection with the modification of an agreement for the business usage of an airplane owned by gfm 2 severance accruals of approximately 100 million related to overhead cost reduction programs to be carried out in 2014 3 executive separation costs of approximately 53 million 4 the impact from the business combinations completed in 2012 and 2013 5 increases in compensation and related expenses resulting primarily from annual merit increases and 6 growth related increases in facilities costs and depreciation and amortization these increases were partially offset by lower travel costs lower sharebased compensation and the fact that 2012 included expenses related to a bonus paid to certain option holders in connection with dividends paid to our shareholders totaling 113 million which did not recur in 2013 the lower sharebased compensation was as a result of the fact that expense from recent stock option grants was more than offset by a 136 million decline in expense related to the repricing of certain stock options in 2012 that did not recur in 2013 

the 555 million increase in selling general and administrative expenses in 2012 was caused by 1 incremental costs resulting from the business combinations completed in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the third quarter of 2012 2 increased spending on business development and it costs including higher depreciation and amortization expense related to an increase in assets in service and 3 expenses related to the repricing of certain stock options in connection with dividends paid to our shareholders resulting in incremental sharebased compensation expense of 136 million and a bonus paid to certain option holders totaling 113 million the remaining increase was primarily the result of increases in compensation and related expenses including the impact of merit increases an increase in headcount and higher incentive compensation these increases were partially offset by a positive foreign currency impact of approximately 179 million and a reduction in facility costs due to a consolidation of offices in europe including lower depreciation and amortization expense due to fewer assets in service 

 

restructuring costs 

 

 we recognized 141 million of restructuring charges net of reversals for changes in estimates in 2013 which was primarily related to our february 2013 restructuring plan to migrate the delivery of services and to reduce anticipated overcapacity in selected areas these actions are expected to result in severance for approximately 400 positions we believe that this plan will result in annual cost savings of approximately 150 to 200 million 

we recognized 187 million of restructuring charges net of reversals for changes in estimates in 2012 which was primarily related to our may 2012 restructuring plan to reduce staffing overcapacity and to rationalize nonbillable support roles this restructuring action has resulted in the elimination of approximately 280 positions primarily in europe we believe that this plan has resulted in annual cost savings of approximately 150 to 250 million 

we recognized 221 million of restructuring charges net of immaterial reversals for changes in estimates in 2011 primarily related to our july 2011 restructuring plan to reduce staffing overcapacity and to rationalize nonbillable support roles as part of our july 2011 plan approximately 290 positions were eliminated primarily in north america and europe

interest income and interest expense 

 

 interest income includes interest received from bank balances and investments in debt securities 

interest expense for 2013 was lower than 2012 primarily due to a decrease in the average debt outstanding in 2013 compared to 2012 resulting from the repayment of the 3000 million term loan which quintiles transnational holdings inc obtained in february 2012 and paid in full in may 2013 or the holdings term loan the pay down of 500 million of outstanding indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities in may 2013 and the mandatory prepayment of 338 million of outstanding indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities in the first quarter of 2013 offset by the increase that resulted from the 1750 million term loan b1 which our whollyowned subsidiary quintiles transnational obtained under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities in october 2012 in addition the average rate of interest in 2013 on the term loans under our senior secured credit facilities was lower than it was in 2012 due to 1 a 50 basis point decrease in the interest rate on the term loan b2 beginning in august 2013 pursuant to the terms and conditions in the credit agreement and 2 the reductions in the interest rate that resulted from the refinancing transactions in the fourth quarters of 2012 and 2013 

interest expense increased in 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily as a result of the holdings term loan which quintiles holdings obtained in february 2012 and the 1750 million term loan b1 which quintiles transnational obtained under its credit agreement in october 2012 see “—liquidity and capital resources” for more information on our debt transactions

other income expense net 

 

 included in other income expense net for 2013 were approximately 40 million of foreign currency net losses in addition 2013 included income of approximately 35 million due to changes in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration for two of our acquisitions completed in 2011 

included in other income expense net for 2012 were approximately 11 million of foreign currency net losses in addition 2012 included income of approximately 46 million due to changes in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration for two of our acquisitions completed in 2011

income tax expense 

 

 the effective income tax rate for 2013 was negatively impacted by the settlement of certain intercompany notes in 2013 that had previously been considered long term investments which resulted in 111 million of income tax expense in addition the effective income tax rate for 2013 was positively impacted by our change in assertion regarding the undistributed earnings of most of our foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states prior to june 2013 we had not considered the majority of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested accordingly 2011 and 2012 were negatively impacted by income taxes provided on most of the earnings of the foreign subsidiaries as a deferred income tax liability was recorded each year for the anticipated income tax costs of repatriating those earnings in the future we reevaluated this assertion following the ipo as a portion of the ipo proceeds were used to pay down debt held in the united states as well as the fact we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future which had been significant in the past with this reduction of debt and related interest expense and the change in approach related to payment of dividends we expect to be able to support the cash needs of our domestic subsidiaries without repatriating cash from the affected foreign subsidiaries we expect to utilize the cash generated outside of the united states to fund growth outside of the united states as a result of the assertion change we recorded an 81 million income tax benefit in the second quarter of 2013 to reverse the deferred income tax liability previously recorded on undistributed foreign earnings prior to 2013 that are now considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states 

the favorable rate in 2011 was primarily due to an approximately 487 million benefit from the recognition of foreign tax credits related to prior years due to an increase in projected foreign source income as a result of improved operational results and the favorable impact of the 2011 refinancing transaction on future results the rate was also favorably impacted due to a 164 million benefit for the release of foreign uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statute of limitations the rate in 2011 was unfavorably impacted by 217 million of income tax expense related to the gain on the sale of our investment in invida for financial reporting purposes the gain on the sale is included in equity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates however our income tax on the gain is included in income tax expense 

equity in losses earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 

 

 in 2011 we sold our investment in invida for approximately 1036 million of net proceeds resulting in a gain of approximately 749 million

our clinical solutions and services growth for 2013 was concentrated in europe and the americas this growth was due largely to growth in the overall market as well as a consistent history of yearoveryear growth in net new business including strong inflow of net new business in 2013 this growth was tempered by a decrease in service revenues from consulting services resulting primarily from the winding down of a project assisting a customer on a regulatory compliance matter and from a large clinical solutions project on which we were executing in 2012 and 2013 but that is now nearing completion

our clinical solutions and services experienced growth in all regions including the americas europe and the asiapacific this growth was due largely to growth in the overall market as well as a consistent history of yearoveryear growth in net new business that resulted in delivery in 2012 on the higher backlog as we entered the year also impacting the growth was an increase in global laboratories test volumes and an increase in the delivery of clinical solutions and services provided on a functional basis principally due to the expansion of services and geographic deployment of resources on existing projects and from the ramp up of new projects this growth was partially offset by lower revenues from early clinical development services and was also tempered by a competitive pricing environment service revenues from consulting services increased primarily as a result of approximately 473 million of revenue related to assisting a customer with a regulatory compliance project

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows in addition to operating cash flows other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include capital expenditures acquisitions debt service requirements dividends equity repurchases adequacy of our revolving credit facility and access to the capital markets 

we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which those funds can be accessed on a cost effective basis the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse income tax consequences in 2013 we changed our assertion regarding the earnings of most of our foreign subsidiaries and now consider them indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states making this assertion limits our ability to repatriate cash from our foreign subsidiaries for the foreseeable future in making this assertion we determined that the cash flows expected to be generated in the united states are expected to be sufficient to fund our operating requirements and debt service obligations in the united states and that we expect the cash generated by the affected foreign subsidiaries will be used to fund growth outside of the united states a future distribution or change in this assertion could result in additional tax liability 

we had a cash balance of 7781 million at december 31 2013 3201 million of which was in the united states an increase from 5677 million at december 31 2012 

on october 30 2013 our board approved an equity repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to 1250 million of either our common stock or vested inthemoney employee stock options or a combination thereof we have used and intend to continue to use cash on hand to fund the equity repurchase program the equity repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any particular amount of common stock or vested inthemoney employee stock options and it could be modified suspended or discontinued at any time repurchases of vested inthemoney employee stock options were made through transactions between us and our employees other than our executive officers who were not eligible to participate in the program and this aspect of the equity repurchase program expired in november 2013 the equity repurchase program for common stock does not have an end date additional information regarding our equity repurchase program is presented in part ii item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” and note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

on may 14 2013 we completed the ipo of our common stock at a price to the public of 4000 per share we issued and sold 13125000 shares of common stock in the ipo and received proceeds of approximately 4896 million after deducting underwriting discounts commissions and related expenses 

we used the net proceeds from the ipo as follows 1 we repaid approximately 3589 million of debt including accrued interest and related fees and expenses 2 we paid a onetime fee of 250 million to terminate our management agreement with our private equity sponsors and 3 we used the remaining portion of the net proceeds together with cash on hand to complete the acquisition of novella for approximately 1466 million in cash net of approximately 262 million of acquired cash 

 

based on our current operating plan we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents future cash flows from operations and our ability to access funds under our revolving credit facility will enable us to fund our operating requirements and capital expenditures and meet debt obligations for at least the next 12 months we regularly evaluate our debt arrangements as well as market conditions and from time to time we may explore opportunities to modify our existing debt arrangements or pursue additional financing arrangements that could result in the issuance of new debt securities by us or our affiliates we may use our existing cash cash generated from operations or dispositions of assets or businesses andor proceeds from any new financing arrangements or issuances of debt or equity securities to repay or reduce some of our outstanding obligations to repurchase shares from our shareholders or for other purposes while our board will review our dividend policy from time to time we currently do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future as part of our ongoing business strategy we also are continually evaluating new acquisition expansion and investment possibilities or other strategic growth opportunities as well as potential dispositions of assets or businesses as appropriate including dispositions that may cause us to recognize a loss on certain assets should we elect to pursue any such transaction we may seek to obtain debt or equity financing to facilitate those activities our ability to enter into any such potential transactions and our use of cash or proceeds is limited to varying degrees by the terms and restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facilities we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to complete any such alternative financing arrangements or other transactions on favorable terms or at all 

senior secured credit agreement 

our senior secured credit agreement provides for a 300 million revolving credit facility due in 2018 there were no amounts drawn on this revolving credit facility in 2013 

on december 20 2013 we entered into an amendment to our senior secured credit agreement to provide a new term loan b3 with a syndicate of banks for an aggregate principal amount of 2061 billion due in 2018 the proceeds from the term loan b3 were used to repay the then outstanding balances of the term loan b1 and term loan b2 and related fees and expenses the term loan b3 bears interest at the greater of libor or 125 plus 25 which is 75 and 25 basis points lower than the interest rates that were in effect on the retired term loan b1 and term loan b2 respectively quarterly principal payments on the term loan b3 are 515 million commencing on september 30 2014 and continuing through march 31 2018 with the balance of the term loan b3 to be repaid at final maturity on june 8 2018 the credit facility arrangements are collateralized by substantially all of the assets of quintiles transnational and the assets of quintiles transnational’s domestic subsidiaries including 100 of the equity interests of substantially all of quintiles transnational’s domestic subsidiaries and 65 of the equity interests of substantially all of the firsttier foreign subsidiaries of quintiles transnational and its domestic subsidiaries in each case other than certain excluded subsidiaries as defined in the credit agreement beginning with fiscal year ending december 31 2014 we are required to apply 50 of excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement subject to a reduction to 25 or 0 depending upon quintiles transnational’s total leverage ratio for prepayment of the term loan b3 with any such prepayment to be applied first in direct order of maturities pro rata to reduce the term loan b3 principal payments due within eight quarters of such prepayment then on a pro rata basis to reduce the other principal payments due prior to the maturity date and then to reduce the principal payments due on the maturity date the amendment also provides additional flexibility for us to enter into certain securitization financing transactions other terms and covenants of the term loan b3 are the same as the terms and covenants of our term loan b1 and term loan b2 prior to the amendment in connection with this amendment to the credit agreement we recognized a 33 million loss on extinguishment of debt which included approximately 16 million of unamortized debt issuance costs approximately 16 million of unamortized discount and approximately 25000 of related fees and expenses

cash flow from operating activities 

 

 2013 compared to 2012 

cash provided by operating activities increased by 617 million in 2013 as compared 2012 the increase in operating cash flow reflects lower payments for income taxes 330 million and interest 116 million in 2013 in addition net income increased despite including cash expenses totaling 325 million for a fee paid in connection with the termination of our management agreement with affiliates of certain of our shareholders 250 million a fee paid in connection with the modification of an agreement for the business usage of an airplane owned by gfm 15 million and a termination fee for the repayment of the 3000 million term loan 60 million these improvements in operating cash flow were partially offset by higher cash used in days sales outstanding or dso 741 million this higher cash used reflected a fiveday increase in dso in 2013 the net impact on cash from the increase in dso resulted from the fact that we have continued to experience a trend toward longer payment terms on our contracts dso can shift significantly at each reporting period depending on the timing of cash receipts under contractual payment terms relative to the recognition of revenue over a project lifecycle 

2012 compared to 2011 

cash provided by operating activities increased by 1747 million in 2012 as compared to 2011 the increase in operating cash flow was primarily as a result of the increase in income from operations an improvement from the impact of the dso of 1624 million and 237 million less cash used to pay expenses related to extinguishing debt in the 2012 compared to the 2011 the improvement in cash flows from dso is as a result of a threeday decrease in dso in 2012 compared to an 11day increase in dso in 2011 the net impact on cash from dso is a result of normal fluctuations in the timing of payments from customers although we have continued to experience a trend toward longer payment terms on our contracts a strong collection effort and significant cash payments late in 2012 on the close out of several large contracts resulted in the timing related decrease in dso these increases were partially offset by higher cash payments in 2012 for income taxes and interest of approximately 406 million and 262 million respectively

      application of critical accounting policies 

note 1 to the consolidated financial statements provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates and related disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes known actual results may differ from those estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied 1 there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement 2 the service offering has been delivered to the customer 3 the collection of fees is probable and 4 the arrangement consideration is fixed or determinable we do not recognize revenue with respect to startup activities including contract and scope negotiation feasibility analysis and conflict of interest review associated with contracts the costs for these activities are expensed as incurred for contracts in which portions of revenue are contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future events we recognize the revenue only after it has been earned and the contingency has been resolved 

 

the majority of our revenue is recognized based on objective contractual criteria and does not require significant estimates or judgments however at any point in time we are working on thousands of active customer projects which are governed by individual contracts most projects are customized based on the needs of the customer the type of services being provided therapeutic indication of the drug geographic locations and other variables project specific terms related to pricing billing terms and the scope and type of services to be provided are generally negotiated and contracted on a projectbyproject basis changes in the scope of work are common especially under longterm contracts and generally result in a change in contract value in such situations we enter into negotiations for a contract amendment to reflect the change in scope and the related price depending on the complexity of the amendment the negotiation process can take from a few weeks for a simple adjustment to several months for a complex amendment in limited situations management may authorize the project team to commence work on activities outside the contract scope while we negotiate and finalize the contract amendment in these limited cases if we are not able to obtain a contract amendment from the customer our profit margin on the arrangement may be impacted this result occurs because our costs of delivery are expensed as they are incurred while revenue is not recognized unless the customer has agreed to the changes in scope and renegotiated pricing terms the contract value is amended and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 

for arrangements that include multiple elements arrangement consideration is allocated to units of accounting based on the relative selling price the best evidence of selling price of a unit of accounting is vendorspecific objective evidence or vsoe which is the price we charge when the deliverable is sold separately when vsoe is not available to determine selling price we use relevant thirdparty evidence or tpe of selling price if available when neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists we use our best estimate of selling price considering all relevant information that is available without undue cost and effort 

most contracts are terminable upon 30 to 90 days notice by the customer our risk of material loss in these situations is mitigated as these contracts generally require payment to us for expenses to wind down the trial or project fees earned to date and in some cases a termination fee or a payment of some portion of the fees or profits that could have been earned under the contract if it had not been terminated early in addition our contract terms provide for payment terms that generally correspond with performance of the services termination fees are included in service revenues when realization is assured 

accounts receivable and unbilled services 

accounts receivable represents amounts billed to customers revenues recognized in excess of billings are classified as unbilled services the realization of these amounts is based on the customer’s willingness and ability to pay us we have an allowance for doubtful accounts based on management’s estimate of probable losses we expect to incur resulting from a customer failing to pay us our allowance for doubtful accounts and losses from customers failing to pay us have not been material to our results of operations if any of these estimates change or actual results differs from expected results then an adjustment is recorded in the period in which the amounts become reasonably estimable these adjustments could have a material effect on our results of operations 

investments in unconsolidated affiliates — equity method investments 

we have investments in unconsolidated affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting periodically we review our investments for a decline in value which we believe may be other than temporary should we identify such a decline we will record a loss through earnings to establish a new cost basis for the investment these losses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

income taxes 

certain items of income and expense are not recognized on our income tax returns and financial statements in the same year which creates timing differences the income tax effect of these timing differences results in 1 deferred income tax assets that create a reduction in future income taxes and 2 deferred income tax liabilities that create an increase in future income taxes recognition of deferred income tax assets is based on management’s belief that it is more likely than not that the income tax benefit associated with certain temporary differences income tax operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and income tax credits would be realized we recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets for those deferred income tax items for which it was more likely than not that realization would not occur we determined the amount of the valuation allowance based in part on our assessment of future taxable income and in light of our ongoing income tax strategies if our estimate of future taxable income or tax strategies changes at any time in the future we would record an adjustment to our valuation allowance recording such an adjustment could have a material effect on our financial position 

 

income tax expense is based on the distribution of profit before income tax among the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate adjusted as required by the income tax laws of each taxing jurisdiction changes in the distribution of profits and losses among taxing jurisdictions may have a significant impact on our effective income tax rate beginning in 2013 we consider the undistributed earnings of most of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states accordingly we have not provided a deferred income tax liability related to those undistributed earnings 

business combinations 

we use the acquisition method to account for business combinations and accordingly the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recorded at their estimated fair values on the date of the acquisition we use significant judgments estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest including expected future cash flows discount rates that reflect the risk associated with the expected future cash flows and estimated useful lives 

when a business combination involves contingent consideration we recognize a liability equal to the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the date of the acquisition the estimate of fair value of a contingent consideration liability requires subjective assumptions to be made regarding future business results including revenues and net new business discount rates that reflect the risk associated with the expected future cash flows and probabilities assigned to various potential business result scenarios we periodically reassess the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration over the term of the arrangement any resulting changes are recognized in earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations 

goodwill tangible and identifiable intangible assets 

we have recorded and allocated to our reporting units the excess of the cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired known as goodwill the recoverability of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated annually for impairment or if and when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized we review the carrying values of other identifiable intangible assets if the facts and circumstances indicate a possible impairment based upon our 2013 annual testing we believe that the risk of a significant impairment to goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets is currently very low other identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 

for goodwill we perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its book value this includes a qualitative analysis of macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations internal cost factors financial performance fair value history and other company specific events if this qualitative analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that estimated fair value is less than the book value for the respective reporting unit we apply a twostep impairment test in which we determine whether the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of its carrying value if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied estimated fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill we determine the implied estimated fair value of goodwill by determining the present value of the estimated future cash flows for each reporting unit and comparing the reporting unit’s risk profile and growth prospects to selected reasonably similar publicly traded companies the inherent subjectivity of applying a discounted cash flow and market comparables approach to valuing our assets and liabilities could have a significant impact on our analysis any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

for indefinitelived intangible assets we perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value if this qualitative analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset we determine the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset trade name by determining the present value of the estimated royalty payments on an aftertax basis that it would be required to pay the owner for the right to use such trade name if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we review the carrying values of property and equipment if the facts and circumstances suggest that a potential impairment may have occurred if this review indicates that carrying values will not be recoverable as determined based on undiscounted cash flows over the remaining depreciation or amortization period we will reduce carrying values to estimated fair value the inherent subjectivity of our estimates of future cash flows could have a significant impact on our analysis any future writeoffs of longlived assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

 

sharebased compensation expense 

in accordance with asc 718 “stock compensation” as modified or supplemented we measure compensation cost for most sharebased payment awards stock options and stock appreciation rights granted to employees and nonemployee directors at fair value using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model sharebased compensation expense includes sharebased awards granted to employees and nonemployee directors and has been reported in selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income based upon the classification of the individuals who were granted sharebased awards 

we calculate the fair value of sharebased compensation awards using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions including share price volatility the expected life of the award riskfree interest rate and the fair value of the underlying common shares on the date of grant in developing our assumptions we take into account the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and other relevant market rate or price changes in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to various market risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity price changes and we regularly evaluate our exposure to such changes our overall risk management strategy seeks to balance the magnitude of the exposure and the cost and availability of appropriate financial instruments from time to time we have utilized forward exchange contracts to manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk the following analyses present the sensitivity of our financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest rates and equity prices that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period 

foreign currency exchange rates 

approximately 378 and 389 of our service revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively were denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar our financial statements are reported in united states dollars and accordingly fluctuations in exchange rates will affect the translation of our revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies into united states dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results in 2013 and 2012 the most significant currency exchange rate exposures were the euro british pound singapore dollar indian rupee and south african rand a hypothetical change of 10 in average exchange rates used to translate all foreign currencies to united states dollars would have impacted income before income taxes for 2013 by approximately 450 million accumulated currency translation adjustments recorded as a separate component of shareholders’ deficit were 58 million and 193 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively we do not have significant operations in countries in which the economy is considered to be highlyinflationary 

we are subject to foreign currency transaction risk for fluctuations in exchange rates during the period of time between the consummation and cash settlement of a transaction we earn revenue from our service contracts over a period of several months and in some cases over a period of several years accordingly exchange rate fluctuations during this period may affect our profitability with respect to such contracts we limit our foreign currency transaction risk through exchange rate fluctuation provisions stated in our contracts with customers or we may hedge our transaction risk with foreign currency exchange contracts at december 31 2013 we had 12 open foreign exchange forward contracts relating to service contracts with various amounts maturing monthly through september 2014 with a notional value totaling approximately 608 million at december 31 2012 we had 12 open foreign exchange forward contracts relating to service contracts with various amounts maturing monthly through september 2013 with a notional value totaling approximately 389 million 

interest rates 

because we have variable rate debt fluctuations in interest rates affect our business we attempt to minimize interest rate risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps we have entered into interest rate swaps with financial institutions that have reset dates and critical terms that match those of our term loan credit facility accordingly any change in market value associated with the interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 2061 billion of total indebtedness with variable interest at the greater of the three month libor or 125 plus 250 or 375 at december 31 2013 of which 9450 million or 459 was hedged at a fixed rate of 255 leaving approximately 1116 billion of unhedged variable rate debt because we do not attempt to hedge all of our variable rate debt we may incur higher interest costs for the portion of our variable rate debt which is not hedged each quarterpoint increase or decrease in the variable interest rate would result in our interest expense changing by approximately 28 million per year under our unhedged variable rate debt 

equity prices 

at december 31 2013 and 2012 we held investments in marketable equity securities these investments are classified as availableforsale and are recorded at fair value in the financial statements these securities are subject to equity price risk as of december 31 2013 and 2012 the fair value of these investments was 77 million and 24 million respectively based on quoted equity prices the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease of 10 in quoted equity price was approximately 767000 and 243000 at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively
