industry  competition 

stores offer monthtomonth rental of storage space for personal or business use tenants typically rent fully enclosed spaces that vary in size and typically range from 5 feet by 5 feet to 20 feet by 20 feet with an interior height of 8 feet to 12 feet tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units stores generally have onsite managers who supervise and run the daytoday operations providing tenants with assistance as needed 

selfstorage provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions due to life changes or simply because of a need for storage space the mix of residential tenants using a store is determined by a store’s local demographics and often includes people who are experiencing life changes such as downsizing their living space or others who 

are not yet settled into a permanent residence items that tenants place in selfstorage are typically furniture household items and appliances commercial tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods records inventory or storage for seasonal goods 

our research has shown that tenants choose a store based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or business making highdensity hightraffic population centers ideal locations for stores a store’s visibility on the internet price perceived security cleanliness and the general professionalism of the store managers and staff are also contributing factors to a store’s ability to successfully secure rentals although most stores are leased to tenants on a monthtomonth basis tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time 

the selfstorage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations a greater portion of revenues and profits are typically realized from may through september historically our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of july while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early march 

the selfstorage industry is a mature industry that has seen the average occupancy continue to increase according to the selfstorage almanac the “almanac” the national average physical occupancy rate was 902 of net rentable square feet in 2015 compared to an average physical occupancy rate of 945 in 2021 our average occupancy for whollyowned stores for 2021 was 948 

the industry is also characterized by fragmented ownership according to the almanac as of the end of 2021 the top ten selfstorage companies in the united states operated approximately 219 of the total us stores and the top 50 selfstorage companies operated approximately 279 of the total us stores we believe this fragmentation will contribute to continued consolidation at some level in the future 

we believe that we are well positioned to compete for acquisitions we have encountered competition when we have sought to acquire existing operating stores especially for brokered portfolios competitive bidding practices have been commonplace between both public and private entities and this will likely continue 

we are the second largest selfstorage operator in the united states our four primary competitors who are public selfstorage reits are cubesmart life storage national storage affiliates and public storage 

longterm growth and investment strategies 

our primary business objectives are to maximize cash flow available for distribution to our stockholders and to achieve sustainable longterm growth in cash flow per share in order to maximize longterm stockholder value both at acceptable levels of risk we continue to evaluate a range of growth initiatives and opportunities our primary strategies include the following 

maximize the performance of our stores through strategic efficient and proactive management 

we pursue revenuegenerating and expenseminimizing opportunities in our operations our revenue management team seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our advanced technology systems ability to provide realtime interactive rental rate and discount management our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement more effective online marketing programs which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost 

we continually analyze our portfolio to look for longterm valueenhancing opportunities we proactively redevelop properties to add units or modify existing unit mix to better meet the demand in a given market and to maximize revenue we also redevelop properties to reduce their effective useful age increase visual appeal enhance security and to improve brand consistency across the portfolio 

acquire selfstorage stores 

our acquisitions team continues to pursue the acquisition of multistore portfolios and single stores which can range from fully occupied to various stages of leaseup that we believe can provide stockholder value we have established a reputation as a reliable ethical buyer which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions in addition we believe our status as an upreit enables flexibility when structuring deals we remain a disciplined buyer and only execute acquisitions that we believe will strengthen our portfolio and increase stockholder value 

in addition to the pursuit of operating stores from time to time we develop stores from the ground up and provide the construction capital we also purchase stores at the completion of construction from third party developers who build to our specifications these stores purchased at completion of construction a certificate of occupancy store create additional 

longterm value for our stockholders we are typically able to acquire these assets at a lower price than a stabilized store and expect greater long term returns on these stores on average however in the short term these acquisitions cause dilution to our earnings during the twotofour year period required to lease up the certificate of occupancy stores we expect that this trend will continue as we continue to acquire certificate of occupancy stores 

grow our management business 

our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees as well as expand our geographic footprint data sophistication and scale with little capital investment we believe this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale in addition we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline we pursue strategic relationships with owners whose stores would enhance our portfolio in the event an opportunity arises to acquire such stores 

expand our bridge loan program 

to broaden the opportunities available we have a bridge lending program under which we provide financing to operating properties that we manage this program helps us increase our management business create additional future acquisition opportunities and strengthen our relationships with partners all while generating interest and fee income we generally originate mortgage loans and mezzanine loans with the intent to sell many of the mortgage loans to third parties while retaining our interests in the mezzanine loans 

invest in other selfstorage businesses selectively 

we have made investments in preferred stock of other selfstorage companies these investments benefit us by providing dividend income increasing our management business and creating additional future acquisition opportunities through relationships with the companies in which we invest we may pursue additional investment opportunities as they become available 

financing of our longterm growth strategies 

acquisition and development financing 

as a reit we are required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income to our stockholders consequently we require access to additional sources of capital to fund our growth we expect to maintain a flexible approach to financing growth we plan to finance future acquisitions through a diverse capital optimization strategy which includes but is not limited to cash generated from operations borrowings under our revolving lines of credit the credit lines secured and unsecured financing equity offerings joint ventures and the sale of stores 

credit lines  we have two credit lines which we primarily use as shortterm bridge financing until we obtain longerterm financing through either debt or equity as of december 31 2021 our credit lines had available capacity of 14 billion of which 8550 million was undrawn 

secured and unsecured debt  we primarily use public bonds unsecured private placement bonds and unsecured bank term loans to finance store acquisitions and development efforts we will continue to utilize a combination of secured and unsecured financing for future store acquisitions and development as of december 31 2021 we had 13 billion of secured notes payable and 41 billion of unsecured notes payable outstanding compared to 22 billion of secured notes payable and 32 billion of unsecured notes payable and senior exchangeable notes outstanding as of december 31 2020 

equity  we have an active at the market atm program for selling stock we sell stock under the atm program from time to time to raise capital when we believe conditions are advantageous during the year ended december 31 2021 we issued 585685 shares of common stock through our atm program and received net proceeds of approximately 666 million we also sold 1600000 shares of common stock in a registered offering structured as a bought deal at a price of 12913 per share resulting in net proceeds of 2066 million during the year ended december 31 2020 we issued 899048 shares of common stock through our atm program and received net proceeds of approximately 1035 million 

we view equity interests in our operating partnership as another source of capital that can provide an attractive tax planning opportunity to sellers of real estate we issue common and preferred operating partnership units to sellers in certain acquisitions common operating partnership units receive distributions equal to the dividends on common stock while preferred operating partnership units receive distributions at various negotiated rates we may issue additional units in the future when circumstances are favorable 

joint ventures  as of december 31 2021 we owned 287 of our stores through joint ventures with third parties our joint venture partners typically provide most of the equity capital required for the acquisition of stores owned in these joint ventures most joint venture agreements include buysell rights as well as rights of first offer in connection with the sale of stores by the joint venture we manage the daytoday operations of the stores owned in these joint ventures and have the right to participate in major decisions relating to sales of stores or financings by the applicable joint venture but do not control the joint ventures 

sale of properties  we have not historically sold a high volume of stores as we generally believe we are able to optimize the cash flow from stores through continued operations however we may sell more stores or interests in stores in the future in response to changing economic financial or investment conditions for the year ended december 31 2021 we sold 16 stores for 2003 million for the year ended december 31 2020 we sold four stores located in florida for 466 million for the year ended december 31 2019 we sold one store located in new york for 113 million

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our securities involves various risks all investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information contained in this annual report before trading in our securities if any of the events set forth in the following risks actually occur our business operating results prospects and financial condition could be harmed 

our performance is subject to risks associated with real estate investments we are a real estate company that derives our income from the operation of our stores there are a number of factors that may adversely affect the income that our stores generate including the following 

risks related to our stores and operations 

adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating results 

our revenues and net operating income can be negatively impacted by general economic factors that lead to a reduction in demand for rental space in the markets in which we operate 

if we are unable to promptly relet our units or if the rates upon such reletting are significantly lower than expected our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

virtually all of our leases are on a monthtomonth basis any delay in reletting units as vacancies arise would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results in addition lower than expected rental rates upon reletting could adversely affect our revenues and impede our growth 

uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flow 

we maintain comprehensive property and casualty insurance policies including liability fire flood earthquake wind as we deem necessary or as required by our lenders umbrella coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our stores certain types of losses however may be either uninsurable not economically insurable or coverage may be excluded on certain policies such as losses due to earthquakes hurricanes tornadoes riots acts of war terrorism or social engineering should an uninsured loss occur we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a store in addition if any such loss is insured we may be required to pay significant amounts on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to our insurer being obligated to reimburse us for the loss or the amount of the loss may exceed our coverage for the loss as a result our operating results may be adversely affected 

legal disputes settlement and defense costs could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

from time to time we have to make monetary settlements or defend actions or arbitration including class actions to resolve tenant employmentrelated or other claims and disputes settling any such liabilities could negatively impact our operating results and cash available for distribution to stockholders and could also adversely affect our ability to sell lease operate or encumber affected properties 

our tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation which may adversely affect our results 

our tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation the regulatory authorities generally have broad discretion to grant renew and revoke licenses and approvals to promulgate interpret and implement regulations and to evaluate compliance with regulations through periodic examinations audits and investigations of the affairs of insurance providers as a result of regulatory or private action in any jurisdiction we may be temporarily or permanently suspended from continuing some or all of our reinsurance activities or otherwise fined or penalized or suffer an adverse judgment which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our stores may adversely affect our results of operations 

under various us federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances which could be substantial such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release or presence of such hazardous substances from time to time we may acquire properties or interests in properties with known adverse environmental conditions for which we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior riskadjusted return 

costs associated with complying with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 may result in unanticipated expenses 

under the ada places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons a number of additional us federal state and local laws may also require modifications to our stores or restrict certain further renovations of the stores with respect to access thereto by disabled persons if one or more of our stores is not in compliance with the ada or other legislation then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the facility into compliance 

there is significant competition among selfstorage operators and from other storage alternatives 

competition in the local markets in which many of our stores are located is significant and has affected our occupancy levels rental rates and operating expenses development of selfstorage facilities has increased in recent years which has intensified competition and we expect it will continue to do so as newly developed facilities are opened development of selfstorage facilities by other operators could continue to increase in the future actions by our competitors may decrease or prevent increases in our occupancy and rental rates while increasing our operating expenses which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria which may impede our growth 

our ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy we may not be successful in identifying suitable stores or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions 

or investments on satisfactory terms or at all failure to identify or consummate acquisitions will slow our growth which could in turn adversely affect our stock price 

our ability to acquire stores on favorable terms and successfully integrate and operate them may be constrained by the following significant risks 

• competition from local investors and other real estate investors with significant capital including other publiclytraded reits and institutional investment funds 

• competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price which could reduce our profitability 

• the inability to achieve satisfactory completion of due diligence investigations and other customary closing conditions and 

• we may acquire stores subject to liabilities without any recourse or with only limited recourse with respect to unknown liabilities such as liabilities for cleanup of undisclosed environmental contamination claims by persons dealing with the former owners of the stores and claims for indemnification by general partners directors officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the stores 

we and our vendors rely on information technology and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes including financial transactions and records personally identifiable information and tenant and lease data we purchase some of our information technology from vendors on whom our systems depend we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential tenant and other sensitive information our information technology systems and those of our thirdparty service providers strategic partners and other contractors or consultants are vulnerable to attack and damage or interruption from computer viruses and malware eg ransomware malicious code natural disasters terrorism war telecommunication and electrical failures hacking cyberattacks phishing attacks and other social engineering schemes employee theft or misuse human error eg social engineering phishing fraud denial or degradation of service attacks sophisticated nationstate and nationstatesupported actors or unauthorized access or use by persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems it is possible that our safety and security measures will not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning or damage or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyberattacks security breaches including physical or electronic breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar breaches can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information 

we and certain of our service providers are from time to time subject to cyberattacks and security incidents while to date we have not experienced a material security breach this risk has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication of such breaches and attempted breaches from around the world have increased furthermore because the technologies used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage or disrupt systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures we may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period even if identified we may be unable to adequately investigate or remediate incidents or breaches due to attackers increasingly using tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls to avoid detection and to remove or obfuscate forensic evidence as a result of the covid19 pandemic we may also face increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and the number of our as well as our service providers’ employees who are and may continue to be working remotely which may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation divert significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to data privacy and protection could adversely affect our business and our financial condition 

in the united states both federal and various state governments have adopted or are considering laws guidelines or rules for the collection distribution use and storage of information collected from or about consumers or their devices for example the california consumer privacy act of 2018 ccpa went into effect on january 1 2020 and creates individual privacy rights for california consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal information the ccpa provides for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation further the california privacy rights act cpra recently passed in california the cpra significantly 

amends the ccpa and will impose additional data protection obligations on covered businesses including additional consumer rights processes limitations on data uses new audit requirements for higher risk data and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data it will also create a new california data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement the majority of the provisions will go into effect on january 1 2023 and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required similar laws have passed in virginia and colorado and have been proposed in other states and at the federal level reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the united states the enactment of such laws could have potentially conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging 

although we work to comply with applicable laws regulations and standards our contractual obligations and other legal obligations these requirements are evolving and may be modified interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with one another or other legal obligations with which we must comply any failure or perceived failure by us or our employees representatives contractors consultants collaborators or other third parties to comply with such requirements or adequately address privacy and security concerns even if unfounded could result in additional cost and liability to us damage our reputation and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our property taxes could increase due to reassessment or property tax rate changes 

real property taxes on our properties may increase as our properties are reassessed by taxing authorities or as property tax rates change therefore the amount of property taxes we are required to pay could increase substantially from the property taxes we currently pay or have paid in the past including on a retroactive basis if our property taxes we pay increase our cash flow would be adversely impacted and our ability to pay any expected dividends to our stockholders and unitholders could be adversely affected 

the covid19 pandemic or other pandemics could adversely affect our results of operations 

during 2021 the united states and other countries around the world have continued to experience a major health pandemic related to covid19 which has created considerable instability and disruption in the us and world economies governmental authorities in impacted regions are taking varied and sometimes dramatic action in an effort to slow the spread of covid19 in 2020 federal state and local jurisdictions issued varying forms of states of emergency orders while many of these states of emergency orders have expired or been removed we continue to monitor existing states of emergency and prepare for any additional states of emergency orders we have updated many of our safety and working practices so that we are prepared to address any future states of emergency orders should they continue or be reinstated 

our business was impacted by covid19 in 2020 in several ways including reductions in new rentals and vacates due to stayat home orders and other restrictions lower achieved rental rates from new customers fewer existing customer rent increases reduced late fee collection and impaired ability to hold auctions resulting in higher accounts receivable and bad debt during 2021 we largely saw a return toward normalcy including higher achieved rates accounts receivable and collections less than 60 days returning to historical norms and auctions being held in most locations as a result of the reductions in vacates we saw record occupancy levels during 2021 

although the selfstorage industry has historically been resilient to ordinary market downturns the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the us and world economies generally and on our future results in particular could be significant and will largely depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted this includes new information which may emerge concerning the severity of covid19 variants the success of actions taken to contain or treat covid19 and reactions by consumers companies governmental entities and capital markets 

risks related to our organization and structure 

conflicts of interest could arise as a result of our relationship with our operating partnership 

conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates and our operating partnership or any partner thereof our directors and officers have duties to our company under applicable maryland law in connection with their management of our company at the same time we through our whollyowned subsidiary have fiduciary duties as a general partner to our operating partnership and to the limited partners under delaware law in connection with the management of our operating partnership our duties through our whollyowned subsidiary as a general partner to our operating partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our company the partnership agreement of our operating partnership does not require us to resolve such conflicts in favor of either our company or the limited partners in our operating partnership unless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement delaware law generally requires a general partner of a delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith fairness and loyalty and which generally prohibit such general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest 

additionally the partnership agreement expressly limits our liability by providing that neither we our direct whollyowned massachusetts business trust subsidiary as the general partner of the operating partnership nor any of our or their trustees directors or officers will be liable or accountable in damages to our operating partnership the limited partners or assignees for errors in judgment mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if we or such trustee director or officer acted in good faith in addition our operating partnership is required to indemnify us our affiliates and each of our respective trustees officers directors employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against any and all losses claims damages liabilities whether joint or several expenses including without limitation attorneys’ fees and other legal fees and expenses judgments fines settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims demands actions suits or proceedings civil criminal administrative or investigative that relate to the operations of the operating partnership provided that our operating partnership will not indemnify for 1 willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law 2 any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement or 3 in the case of a criminal proceeding the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful 

the provisions of delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement 

our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority 

as of december 31 2021 we held interests in 287 operating stores through joint ventures some of these arrangements could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority our reliance on coventurers financial conditions and disputes between us and our coventurers we expect to continue our joint venture strategy by entering into more joint ventures for the purpose of developing new stores and acquiring existing stores in such event we would not be in a position to exercise sole decisionmaking authority regarding the property partnership joint venture or other entity the decisionmaking authority regarding the stores we currently hold through joint ventures is either vested exclusively with our joint venture partners is subject to a majority vote of the joint venture partners or is equally shared by us and the joint venture partners in addition investments in partnerships joint ventures or other entities may under certain circumstances involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or coventurers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions partners or coventurers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions such as a sale because neither we nor the partner or coventurer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or coventurers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers andor directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or coventurers might result in subjecting stores owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our thirdparty partners or coventurers which could harm our financial condition 

certain provisions of maryland law and our organizational documents including the stock ownership limit imposed by our charter may inhibit market activity in our stock and could prevent or delay a change in control transaction 

our charter subject to certain exceptions authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a reit and to limit any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 70 by value 

or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding common stock or 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limit however our board of directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership limit to any proposed transferee whose ownership could jeopardize our qualification as a reit these restrictions on ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the ownership limit may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders different ownership limits apply to the family of kenneth m woolley certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing to spencer f kirk certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and to certain designated investment entities as defined in our charter 

our board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder approval in addition our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares our board of directors could issue additional shares of our common stock or establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise not be in the best interests of our stockholders 

our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited 

maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances in addition our charter eliminates our directors’ and officers’ liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law as a result we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law in addition we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers 

risks related to our debt financings 

disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us 

uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to refinance existing debt maturities on favorable terms or at all which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions and fund development projects a downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell stores or may adversely affect the price we receive for stores that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing 

required payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our stores or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 60 billion of outstanding indebtedness we may incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions and development we may borrow under our credit lines or borrow new funds to finance these future stores additionally we do not anticipate that our internally generated cash flow will be adequate to repay our existing indebtedness upon maturity and therefore we expect to repay our indebtedness through refinancings and equity andor debt offerings further we may need to borrow funds in order to make cash distributions to maintain our qualification as a reit or to make our expected distributions to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income each year determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains and we are subject to us federal corporate income tax to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income each year determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and including net capital gains 

if we are required to utilize our credit lines for purposes other than acquisition activity this will reduce the amount available for acquisitions and could slow our growth therefore our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences including the following 

• our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments 

• we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms including to make acquisitions or to continue to make distributions required to maintain our qualification as a reit 

• we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness 

• because a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates an increase in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense 

• we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our stores possibly on disadvantageous terms 

• after debt service the amount available for cash distributions to our stockholders is reduced 

• we may experience increased vulnerability to economic and industry downturns reducing our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions 

• we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our stores that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases andor enforce our guarantees 

• we may violate restrictive covenants in our loan documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations and 

• our default under any one of our mortgage loans with crossdefault or crosscollateralization provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness or result in the foreclosures of other stores 

increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and make cash distributions to our stockholders 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 60 billion of debt outstanding of which approximately 15 billion or 247 was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps this variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 13 per annum increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase our interest expense which could harm our cash flow and our ability to pay cash distributions 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations 

in certain cases we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements hedging involves risks such as the risk that the counterparty may fail to honor its obligations under an arrangement failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders 

changes in the method pursuant to which the london interbank offered rate “libor” is determined and the transition to other benchmarks may adversely affect our financial results 

libor and certain other “benchmarks” have been the subject of continuing national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform in july 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority “fca” which regulates libor publicly announced that it intends to phase out libor and on march 5 2021 the fca announced that usd libor will no longer be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after december 31 2021 in the case of one week and two month usd settings and immediately after june 30 2023 in the case of the remaining usd settings additionally banking regulators including the us federal reserve have encouraged banks to discontinue new libor debt issuances after december 31 2021 this announcement has several implications including setting the spread that may be used to automatically convert contracts from libor to the secured overnight financing rate sofr sofr is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by us treasury securities and is based on directly observable us treasurybacked repurchase transactions although sofr appears to be the preferred replacement rate for us dollar libor it is unclear if other benchmarks may emerge or if other rates will be adopted outside of the united states 

we anticipate that the most commonly used tenors of libor will continue to be available at least until june 30 2023 any changes adopted by the fca or other governing bodies in the method used for determining libor may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported libor if that were to occur our interest payments could change in addition uncertainty about the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates andor payments that are higher or lower than if libor were to remain available in its current form 

we have contracts that are indexed to libor and are monitoring and evaluating the related risks which include interest on loans and amounts received and paid on derivative instruments these risks arise in connection with transitioning contracts to an alternative rate including any resulting value transfer that may occur and are likely to vary by contract the value of loans securities or derivative instruments tied to libor as well as interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may also be impacted if libor is limited or discontinued for some instruments the method of transitioning to an alternative reference rate may be challenging especially if we cannot agree with the respective counterparty about how to make the transition 

while we expect libor to be available in substantially its current form until at least the end of june 30 2023 it is possible that libor will become unavailable prior to that point this could result for example if sufficient banks decline to make submissions to the libor administrator in that case the risks associated with the transition to an alternative reference rate will be accelerated and magnified 

alternative rates and other market changes related to the replacement of libor including the introduction of financial products and changes in market practices may lead to risk modeling and valuation challenges such as adjusting interest rate accrual calculations and building a term structure for an alternative rate 

the introduction of an alternative rate also may create additional basis risk and increased volatility as alternative rates are phased in and utilized in parallel with libor 

adjustments to systems and mathematical models to properly process and account for alternative rates will be required which may have a material adverse effect on our financing costs and as a result our financial condition operating results and cash flows 

our existing indebtedness contains covenants that limit our operating flexibility and failure to comply with all covenants in our debt agreements could materially and adversely affect us 

our debt agreements including our credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility and term loans and the indentures governing our public traded notes contain various financial and other covenants that we and our operating partnership must comply with including total debt to asset ratios secured debt to total asset ratios adjusted ebitda to fixed charged ratios and minimum ratios of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt which we must maintain 

these covenants may limit our operating flexibility and could prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise growing our business or competing effectively our ability to meet these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control and we may be unable to maintain compliance with these covenants if we fail to meet these requirements we may be unable to obtain waivers from the lenders or indenture trustee as applicable or amend the covenants 

a breach of any of the covenants or other provisions in our debt agreements could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in such debt becoming due and payable either automatically or after an election to accelerate by the required percentage of the holders of the indebtedness or by an agent for the holders of the indebtedness this in turn could cause our other debt including the notes and our revolving credit facility to become due and payable as a result of crossdefault or crossacceleration provisions contained in the agreements governing the other debt and permit certain of our lenders to foreclose on our assets if any that secure this debt in the event that some or all of our debt is accelerated and becomes immediately due and payable we may not have the funds to repay or the ability to refinance our debt 

risks related to qualification and operation as a reit 

dividends payable by reits may be taxed at higher rates 

dividends payable by reits may be taxed at higher rates than dividends of nonreit corporations the maximum us federal income tax rate for qualified dividends paid by domestic nonreit corporations to us stockholders that are individuals trust or estates is generally 20 dividends paid by reits to such stockholders are generally not eligible for that rate but under current tax law such stockholders may deduct up to 20 of ordinary dividends ie dividends not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income received from a reit for taxable years beginning before january 1 2026 although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by reits such tax rate may still be higher than the tax rate applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends this may cause investors to view reit investments as less attractive than investments in nonreit corporations which in turn may adversely affect the value of stock of reits including our stock in addition the relative attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends which could negatively affect the value of our stores 

possible legislative or other actions affecting reits could adversely affect our stockholders 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue service irs and the us department of the treasury changes to the tax laws with or without retroactive application could adversely affect our investors or us in ways we cannot predict new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit the us federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the us federal income tax consequences of an investment in us also the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities or an investment in other entities could change making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit 

our failure to qualify as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock 

we believe we operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit or lose our qualification as a reit at any time we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution for each of the years involved because 

  

• we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to us federal corporate income tax on our taxable income 

• we also could be subject to the us federal alternative minimum income tax for taxable years prior to 2018 and possibly increased state and local taxes and 

• unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following a year during which we were disqualified 

in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits this means that our us individual stockholders would be taxed on our dividends at capital gains rates and our us corporate stockholders would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends subject in each case to applicable limitations under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes and are able to avail ourselves of one or more of the relief provisions under the internal revenue code in order to maintain our reit status we may nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of 50000 or more for each such failure as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our securities 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the internal revenue code is greater in the case of a reit that like us holds its assets through a partnership the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the composition of our assets the sources of our gross income and the owners of our stock our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market value of our assets some of which are not susceptible to precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals our ability to satisfy the income tests depends on the sources and amounts of our gross income which we may not be able to control also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains and we will be subject to us federal corporate income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income without regard to the dividends paid deduction and including net capital gains 

we own and may acquire direct or indirect interests in entities that have elected or will elect to be taxed as reits under the internal revenue code each a “subsidiary reit” a subsidiary reit is subject to the various reit qualification requirements and other limitations described herein that are applicable to us if a subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit then i that subsidiary reit would become subject to us federal income tax ii shares in such subsidiary reit would cease to be qualifying assets for purposes of the asset tests applicable to reits and iii it is possible that we would fail certain of the asset tests applicable to reits in which event we would fail to qualify as a reit unless we could avail ourselves of certain relief provisions 

in addition legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors our ability to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that is intended to allow us to qualify for taxation as a reit we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a 

reit for us federal income tax purposes we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the irs regarding our qualification as a reit 

we will pay some taxes reducing cash available for stockholders 

even though we qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we will be required to pay some us federal state and local taxes on our income and property extra space management inc manages stores for our joint ventures and stores owned by third parties we jointly with certain corporate subsidiaries including extra space management inc elected to treat each such subsidiary as a taxable reit subsidiary “trs” of our company for us federal income tax purposes a trs is subject to us federal corporate income tax and may also be subject to state and local taxes on its taxable income esm reinsurance limited a whollyowned subsidiary of extra space management inc generates income from insurance premiums that are subject to us federal income tax and state insurance premiums tax and pays certain insurance royalties to us in addition we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements among our tenants our trs and us are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties also if we sell property as a dealer ie to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on any gain arising from such sales while we do not intend to sell stores as a dealer the irs could take a contrary position to the extent that we are or any of our trss is required to pay us federal state or local taxes we will have less cash available for distribution to stockholders

 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2021 we owned or had ownership interests in 1268 operating stores of these stores 981 are whollyowned four are in a consolidated joint venture and 283 are in unconsolidated joint ventures in addition we managed 828 stores for third parties bringing the total number of stores which we own andor manage to 2096 these stores are located in 41 states and washington dc the majority of our stores are clustered around large population centers the clustering of assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale our acquisitions have given us an increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in many markets where we had no previous presence 

as of december 31 2021 approximately 1250000 tenants were leasing storage units at the operating stores that we own andor manage primarily on a monthtomonth basis providing the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit existing tenants generally receive rate increases at least annually for which no direct correlation has been drawn to our vacancy trends although leases are shortterm in duration the typical tenant tends to remain at our stores for an extended period of time for stores that were stabilized as of december 31 2021 the average length of stay was approximately 147 months 

the average annual rent per square foot for our existing customers at stabilized stores net of discounts and bad debt was 1803 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 1621 for the year ended december 31 2020 average annual rent per square foot for new leases was 1953 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 1464 for the year ended december 31 2020 the average discounts as a percentage of rental revenues during these periods were 32 and 32 respectively 

our store portfolio is made up of different types of construction and building configurations most often sites are what we consider “hybrid” facilities a mix of both driveup buildings and multifloor buildings we have a number of multifloor buildings with elevator access only and a number of facilities featuring groundfloor access only 

the following table presents additional information regarding net rentable square feet and the number of stores by state

overview 

we are a fully integrated selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust “reit” formed to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop selfstorage properties “stores” we derive substantially all of our revenues from our two segments storage operations and tenant reinsurance primary sources of revenue for our storage operations segment include rents received from tenants under leases at each of our whollyowned stores our operating results depend materially on our ability to lease available selfstorage units to actively manage unit rental rates and on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments consequently management spends a significant portion of their time maximizing cash flows from our diverse portfolio of stores revenue from our tenant reinsurance segment consists of insurance revenues from the reinsurance of risks relating to the loss of goods stored by tenants in our stores 

our stores are generally situated in highly visible locations clustered around large population centers the clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale to maximize the performance of our stores we employ industryleading revenue management systems developed by our management team these systems enable us to analyze set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions we believe our systems and processes allow us to more proactively manage revenues 

we operate in competitive markets often where consumers have multiple stores from which to choose competition has impacted and will continue to impact our store results we experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity we believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the combination of our revenue management team and our industryleading technology systems we consider a store to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization we consider a store to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 of the current year or has been open for three years prior to january 1 of the current year 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those that impact our most critical accounting policies we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances a summary of significant accounting policies is also provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements actual results may differ from these estimates we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies and estimates 

consolidation arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as variable interest entities “vies” an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it is the primary beneficiary of the vie 

under certain circumstances when we enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures a vie may be created the primary factors that require the most judgment in determining whether the joint venture is a vie are whether the decisions that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance were controlled by the equity holders as a group and whether the joint venture has sufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated support 

if the joint venture is determined to be a vie we perform a qualitative analysis including considering which party if any has the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of each vie and whether that party has the obligation to absorb losses of the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could be significant to the vie if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie the assets liabilities and operations of the vie are consolidated within 

our financial statements otherwise our investment is generally accounted for under the equity method our ability to correctly assess the influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of the investment in our consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2021 we had one consolidated vie consisting of four stores as of december 31 2020 we had no consolidated vies 

real estate assets we account for the acquisition of stores including by merger and other acquisitions of real estate in accordance with asc 80510  business combinations we use our judgment to determine if assets acquired meet the definition of a business or if the acquisition should be considered an asset acquisition we must make significant assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired and consideration transferred these fair value estimates are sensitive to price of land per square foot and current replacement cost estimates including adjustments for the age class height square footage condition location and turnkey factor these assumptions and estimates require judgment and therefore others could come to materially different conclusions as to the estimated fair values which could result in differences in depreciation and amortization expense gains and losses on the sale of real estate assets and real estate and intangible asset values 

evaluation of asset impairment long lived assets held for use are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment we review each store at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist we focus on stores where occupancy andor rental income have decreased by a significant amount for these stores we determine whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the store will likely recover the lost occupancy andor revenue in the short term in addition we review stores in the leaseup stage and compare actual operating results to original projections we may not have identified all material facts and circumstances that affect impairment of our stores no material impairments were recorded in the year ended december 31 2021 

derivative instruments and hedging activities we hold a number of derivative instruments which we use to hedge our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows mainly related to our interest rates on variable interest debt we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes we assess our derivatives both at inception and on an ongoing quarterly basis for whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are effective the rules and interpretations relating to the accounting for derivatives are complex failure to apply this guidance correctly may require us to recognize all changes in fair value of the hedged derivative in earnings which may materially impact our results 

income taxes we have elected to be treated as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code in order to maintain our qualification as a reit among other things we are required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets as a reit we are not subject to us federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to our stockholders we plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex for any taxable year that we fail to qualify as a reit and for which applicable statutory relief provisions did not apply we would be subject to us federal corporate income tax on all of our taxable income for at least that year and the ensuing four years we could also be subject to penalties and interest and our net income may be materially different from the amounts reported in our financial statements 

we have elected to treat certain corporate subsidiaries including extra space management inc as a trs in general a trs may perform additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or nonreal estate related business a trs is subject to us federal corporate income tax and may also be subject to state and local income taxes interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense when incurred if tax authorities determine that amounts paid by any of our trss to us are not reasonable compared to similar arrangements among unrelated parties we could be subject to a penalty tax on the excess payments

overview 

results for the year ended december 31 2021 included the operations of 1268 stores 981 whollyowned four in consolidated joint ventures and 283 in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method compared to the results for the year ended december 31 2020 which included the operations of 1197 stores 944 whollyowned six in a consolidated joint venture and 247 in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method material or unusual changes in the results of our operations are discussed below 

revenues 

the following table presents information on revenues earned for the years indicated 

property rental— the increase in property rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 was primarily the result of an increase of 151217 at our stabilized stores related to high occupancy and increased rents to new and existing customers property rental revenue also increased by 40792 associated with acquisitions completed in 2021 and 2020 we acquired 74 stores during the year ended december 31 2021 and we acquired 23 stores during the year ended december 31 2020 property rental revenue also increased by 5193 during the year ended december 31 2021 as a result of increases in occupancy at our leaseup stores these increases were offset by approximately 15460 related to the sale of 16 stores into a new joint venture and 16 stores to a third party during 2021 

tenant reinsurance —the increase in tenant reinsurance revenues was due primarily to an increase in the number of stores operated and the higher average occupancy across the portfolio we operated 2096 stores at december 31 2021 compared to 1921 stores at december 31 2020 

management fees and other income —management fees and other income represent the fees collected for our management of stores owned by third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures and other transaction fee income the increase for the year ended december 31 2021 was primarily due to an increase in the number of stores managed as of december 31 2021 we managed 1115 stores for third parties and joint ventures compared to 977 stores as of december 31 2020 

expenses 

the following table presents information on expenses for the years indicated 

property operations —the increase in property operations expense consists primarily of an increase of 13440 related to acquisitions completed in 2021 and 2020 we acquired 74 stores during the year ended december 31 2021 and acquired 23 stores during the year ended december 31 2020 the increase was partially offset by a decrease in expense of 4755 related to property sales 

tenant reinsurance —tenant reinsurance expense represents the costs that are incurred to provide tenant reinsurance the increase in tenant reinsurance expense for the year ended december 31 2021 was due primarily to the increase in total number of stores operated compared to the prior year and major storm events that occurred causing an increase in claim payouts we operated 2096 stores at december 31 2021 compared to 1921 stores at december 31 2020 

general and administrative— general and administrative expenses primarily include all expenses not directly related to our stores including corporate payroll travel and professional fees these expenses are recognized as incurred during 2021 we experienced higher than average turnover and extended times to fill additionally we experienced wage pressure which led to increases in wages of approximately 10 nationwide these trends will directly increase general  administrative expenses in 2022 no other material trends in specific travel or other expenses were observed 

depreciation and amortization —depreciation and amortization expense increased as a result of the acquisition of new stores we acquired 74 stores during the year ended december 31 2021 and acquired 23 stores during the year ended december 31 2020 

other income and expenses 

the following table presents information on other revenues and expenses for the years indicated 

gain on real estate transactions — during the first quarter of 2021 we sold 16 stores to a newly established unconsolidated joint venture for a total sales price of 168885 resulting in a gain of 63477 additionally we sold 16 stores during the fourth quarter of 2021 to a third party for a total sales price of 204500 resulting in a gain of 73854 

interest expense— the decrease in interest expense during the year ended december 31 2021 was primarily the result of a lower average interest rate when compared to the same period in the prior year information on the total face value of debt and the average interest rate for each quarter during the years ended december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 is set forth in the following table 

noncash interest expense related to amortization of discount on equity component of exchangeable senior notes— represents the amortization of the discounts related to the equity components of the exchangeable senior notes issued by our operating partnership the exchangeable senior notes had an effective interest rate of 40 relative to the carrying amount of the liability the notes were paid in full in november 2020 

interest income— interest income represents amounts earned on cash and cash equivalents deposited with financial institutions interest earned on bridge loans and debt securities and income earned on notes receivable from common and preferred operating partnership unit holders in late 2018 we began to provide bridge financing on completed properties owned by third parties that we manage the total principal balance of bridge loans receivable as of december 31 2021 was 279042 compared to 187368 as of december 31 2020 we also purchased a senior mezzanine note receivable with a principal amount of 103000 in july 2020 the increase in interest income during the year ended december 31 2021 was primarily the result of interest earned on these loans as well as interest earned from our investment in preferred stock of jernigan capital inc jcap in connection with the acquisition of jcap by affiliates of nexpoint advisors lp which was purchased in november 2020 for 300000 

equity in earnings and dividend income from unconsolidated real estate entities— equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures represents the income earned through our ownership interests in unconsolidated real estate ventures in joint ventures we and our joint venture partners generally receive a preferred return on our invested capital to the extent that cash or profits in excess of these preferred returns are generated we receive a higher percentage of the excess cash or profits as applicable dividend income represents dividends from our investment in convertible preferred stock of smartstop which was purchased in october 2019 for 150000 with another 50000 invested in october 2020 the increase in earnings for the year ended december 31 2021 is related in part to the dividend income from the secondary investment of smartstop preferred stock additionally the increases related to the higher income at our joint ventures are due to store performance and the acquisition of 45 stores with new and existing joint venture partners these increases were offset by the sale of our equity interest in 22 stores 

equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures—gain on sale of real estate assets and purchase of joint venture partners interest— in june 2021 we sold our interest in two unconsolidated single store joint ventures to our joint ventures partner we received proceeds of 1888 in cash and recorded a gain of 525 also as of june 2021 the wicnn jv llc and gfn jv llc joint ventures sold all 17 of the stores owned by the joint ventures to a third party subsequent to the sales these joint ventures were dissolved as a result of these transactions we recorded a gain of 5739 

income tax expense— for the year ended december 31 2021  the increase in income tax expense was the result of an increase in income earned by our trs when compared to the same period in the prior year 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2020 to the year ended december 31 2019 

the results of operations for the years ended december 31 2020 compared to december 31 2019 was included in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 on page 19 under part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which was filed with the sec on february 26 2021 

funds from operations 

funds from operations ffo provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary along with net income and cash flows for an understanding of our operating results we believe ffo is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings net earnings assume that the values of real estate assets diminish 

predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses the values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and we believe ffo more accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts inc “nareit” as net income computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” excluding gains or losses on sales of operating stores and impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate assets plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis we believe that to further understand our performance ffo should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with gaap as presented in the consolidated financial statements ffo should not be considered a replacement of net income computed in accordance with gaap 

the computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions 

the following table presents the calculation of ffo for the periods indicated 

samestore results 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2021 to the year ended december 31 2020 

our samestore pool for the periods presented consists of 842 stores that are whollyowned and operated and that were stabilized by the first day of the earliest calendar year presented we consider a store to be stabilized once it has been open for three years or has sustained average square foot occupancy of 80 or more for one calendar year we believe that by providing samestore results from a stabilized pool of stores with accompanying operating metrics including but not limited to occupancy rental revenue growth operating expense growth net operating income growth etc stockholders and potential investors are able to evaluate operating performance without the effects of nonstabilized occupancy levels rent levels expense levels acquisitions or completed developments samestore results should not be used as a basis for future samestore performance or for the performance of our stores as a whole the following table presents operating data for our samestore portfolio 



samestore revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 increased compared to the prior year due to higher average occupancy higher average rates to new and existing customers and higher late fees partially offset by higher discounts expenses were lower for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the prior year primarily due to decreases in payroll and marketing expense partially offset by increases in property taxes credit card processing fees repairs and maintenance expense and insurance expense 

the following table presents a reconciliation of samestore net operating income to net income as presented on our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2020 to the year ended december 31 2019 

the samestore results for the years ended december 31 2020 compared to december 31 2019 was included in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 on page 25 under part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which was filed with the sec on february 26 2021 

cash flows 

cash flows from operating activities increased as expected due to our continued growth in revenues and through the increase in the number of properties we own and operate cash flows used in investing activities relate primarily to our acquisitions and development of new stores sales of stores investments in unconsolidated real estate entities and notes receivable from bridge loans and fluctuate depending on our actions in those areas cash flows from financing activities depend primarily on our debt and equity financing activities a summary of cash flows along with significant components are as follows 



we believe that cash flows generated by operations along with our existing cash and cash equivalents the availability of funds under our existing lines of credit and our access to capital markets will be sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during the next twelve months these cash needs include operating expenses monthly debt service payments recurring capital expenditures acquisitions funding for new notes receivable for bridge loans building redevelopments and expansions distributions to unit holders and dividends to stockholders necessary to maintain our reit qualification 

we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations and we consider projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash these cash flows are principally derived from rents paid by our tenants a significant deterioration in projected cash flows from operations could cause us to increase our reliance on available funds under our existing lines of credit curtail planned capital expenditures or seek other additional sources of financing 

liquidity and capital resources 

financing strategy 

we will continue to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts reviewed from time to time by our board of directors although our board of directors has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur we will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or variable rate in making financing decisions we will consider factors including but not limited to 

  

• the interest rate of the proposed financing 

• the extent to which the financing impacts flexibility in managing our stores 

• prepayment penalties and restrictions on refinancing 

• the purchase price of stores acquired with debt financing 

• longterm objectives with respect to the financing 

• target investment returns 

• the ability of particular stores and our company as a whole to generate cash flow sufficient to cover expected debt service payments 

• overall level of consolidated indebtedness 

• timing of debt maturities 

• provisions that require recourse and crosscollateralization and 

• corporate credit ratios including fixed charge coverage ratio and max securedunsecured indebtedness 

our indebtedness may be recourse nonrecourse crosscollateralized crossdefaulted secured or unsecured in addition we may invest in stores subject to existing loans collateralized by mortgages or similar liens or may refinance stores acquired on a leveraged basis we may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness to refinance investments including the redevelopment of existing stores for general working capital or to purchase additional interests in partnerships or joint ventures or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable 

as of december 31 2021 we had 71126 available in cash and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts during 2021 and 2020 we experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash or cash equivalents however there can be no assurance that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 

as of december 31 2021 we had 5984113 face value of debt resulting in a debt to total enterprise value ratio of 156 as of december 31 2020 we had 5767771 face value of debt resulting in a debt to total enterprise value ratio of 275 as of december 31 2021 the ratio of total fixedrate debt and other instruments to total debt was 753 including 1983145 on which we have interest rate swaps that have been included as fixedrate debt as of december 31 2020 the ratio of total fixedrate debt and other instruments to total debt was 631 including 2091269 on which we have interest rate swaps that have been included as fixedrate debt the weighted average interest rate of total debt at december 31 2021 and 2020 was 26 and 27 respectively 

in january 2021 we received a baa2 rating from moodys investors service and in july 2019 we obtained a bbbstable rating from sp we intend to manage our balance sheet to preserve such ratings certain of our real estate assets are pledged as collateral for our debt we have a total of 752 unencumbered stores as defined by our public bonds our unencumbered asset value is calculated as 13498591 and our total asset value is calculated as 18072262 according to the calculations as defined by our public bonds we are subject to certain restrictive covenants relating to our outstanding debt we were in compliance with all financial covenants at december 31 2021 

we expect to fund our shortterm liquidity requirements including operating expenses recurring capital expenditures dividends to stockholders distributions to holders of operating partnership units and interest on our outstanding indebtedness out of our operating cash flow cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving lines of credit in addition we are pursuing additional sources of financing based on anticipated funding needs 

our liquidity needs consist primarily of operating expenses monthly debt service payments recurring capital expenditures distributions to unit holders and dividends to stockholders necessary to maintain our reit qualification we may from time to time seek to repurchase our outstanding debt shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors in addition we evaluate on an ongoing basis the merits of strategic acquisitions and other relationships which may require us to raise additional funds we may also use 

operating partnership units as currency to fund acquisitions from selfstorage owners who desire taxdeferral in their exiting transactions 

contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2021 the weighted average interest rate for all fixed rate debt was 31 and the weighted average interest rate on all variable rate debt was 13 

for more information on our contractual obligations related to real estate acquisitions refer to our commitments and contingencies footnote in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

seasonality 

the selfstorage business has been subject to seasonal fluctuations a greater portion of revenues and profits is typically realized from may through september historically our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of july while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early march results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our future income cash flows and fair values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary and tax policies domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 5984113 in total face value debt of which approximately 1477679 was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 14777 annually 

interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur further in the event of a change of that magnitude we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure 

derivative instruments 

we use derivative instruments to help manage interest rate risk using designated hedge relationships interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixedrate and variablerate interest payments between two parties based on a contractual underlying notional amount but do not involve the exchange of the underlying notional amounts see our derivatives footnote in our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information about our use of derivative contracts

management 

members of our executive management team have significant experience in all aspects of the selfstorage industry our executive management team and their years of industry experience are as follows joseph d margolis chief executive officer 16 years scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer 20 years samrat sondhi executive vice president and chief marketing officer 18 years gwyn mcneal executive vice president and chief legal officer 15 years matt herrington executive vice president and chief operations officer 13 years noah springer executive vice president and chief strategy and partnership officer 15 years zach dickens executive vice president and chief investment officer 18 years 

our executive management team and board of directors have an ownership position in the company with executive officers and directors owning approximately 2887647 shares or 22 of our outstanding common stock as of february 19 2021 

industry  competition 

stores offer monthtomonth rental of storage space for personal or business use tenants typically rent fully enclosed spaces that vary in size and typically range from 5 feet by 5 feet to 20 feet by 20 feet with an interior height of 8 feet to 12 feet tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units stores generally have onsite managers who supervise and run the daytoday operations providing tenants with assistance as needed 

selfstorage provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions due to life changes or simply because of a need for storage space the mix of residential tenants using a store is determined by a store’s local demographics and often includes people who are experiencing life changes such as downsizing their living space or others who 

are not yet settled into a permanent residence items that tenants place in selfstorage are typically furniture household items and appliances commercial tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods records inventory or storage for seasonal goods 

our research has shown that tenants choose a store based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or business making highdensity hightraffic population centers ideal locations for stores a store’s visibility on the internet price perceived security cleanliness and the general professionalism of the store managers and staff are also contributing factors to a store’s ability to successfully secure rentals although most stores are leased to tenants on a monthtomonth basis tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time 

the selfstorage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations a greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from may through september historically our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of july while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early march 

the selfstorage industry is a mature industry that has seen the average occupancy continue to increase according to the selfstorage almanac the “almanac” in 2014 the national average physical occupancy rate was 891 of net rentable square feet compared to an average physical occupancy rate of 922 in 2020 our average occupancy for whollyowned stores for 2020 was 931 

the industry is also characterized by fragmented ownership according to the almanac as of the end of 2020 the top ten selfstorage companies in the united states operated approximately 214 of the total us stores and the top 50 selfstorage companies operated approximately 274 of the total us stores we believe this fragmentation will contribute to continued consolidation at some level in the future 

we believe that we are well positioned to compete for acquisitions we have encountered competition when we have sought to acquire existing operating stores especially for brokered portfolios competitive bidding practices have been commonplace between both public and private entities and this will likely continue 

we are the second largest selfstorage operator in the united states we are one of five public selfstorage reits along with cubesmart life storage national storage affiliates and public storage 

longterm growth and investment strategies 

our primary business objectives are to maximize cash flow available for distribution to our stockholders and to achieve sustainable longterm growth in cash flow per share in order to maximize longterm stockholder value both at acceptable levels of risk we continue to evaluate a range of growth initiatives and opportunities our primary strategies include the following 

maximize the performance of our stores through strategic efficient and proactive management 

we pursue revenuegenerating and expenseminimizing opportunities in our operations our revenue management team seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our advanced technology systems ability to provide realtime interactive rental rate and discount management our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement more effective online marketing programs which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost 

we continually analyze our portfolio to look for longterm valueenhancing opportunities we proactively redevelop properties to add units or modify existing unit mix to better meet the demand in a given market and to maximize revenue we also redevelop properties to reduce their effective useful age increase visual appeal enhance security and to improve brand consistency across the portfolio 

acquire selfstorage stores 

our acquisitions team continues to pursue the acquisition of multistore portfolios and single stores that we believe can provide stockholder value we have established a reputation as a reliable ethical buyer which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions in addition we believe our status as an upreit enables flexibility when structuring deals we remain a disciplined buyer and only execute acquisitions that we believe will strengthen our portfolio and increase stockholder value 

in addition to the pursuit of stabilized stores from time to time we develop stores from the ground up and provide the construction capital we also purchase stores at the completion of construction from third party developers who build to our specifications these stores purchased at completion of construction a certificate of occupancy store create additional 

long term value for our stockholders we are typically able to acquire these assets at a lower price than a stabilized store and expect greater long term returns on these stores on average however in the short term these acquisitions cause dilution to our earnings during the twotofour year period required to lease up the certificate of occupancy stores we expect that this trend will continue in 2021 as we continue to acquire certificate of occupancy stores 

grow our management business 

our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees as well as expand our geographic footprint data sophistication and scale with little capital investment we believe this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale in addition we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline we pursue strategic relationships with owners whose stores would enhance our portfolio in the event an opportunity arises to acquire such stores 

expand our bridge loan program 

to broaden the opportunities available we have implemented a bridge lending program under which we provide financing to operating properties that we manage we anticipate that this program will help us increase our management business create additional future acquisition opportunities and strengthen our relationships with partners all while providing interest and fee income we generally originate mortgage loans and mezzanine loans with the intent to sell the mortgage loans to third parties while retaining our interests in the mezzanine loans 

invest in other selfstorage businesses selectively 

we have recently made investments in preferred stock of other selfstorage companies these investments benefit us by not only providing dividend income but also have increased our management business creating additional future acquisition opportunities through creating and strengthening relationships with the companies in which we invest we may pursue additional investment opportunities as they become available 

financing of our longterm growth strategies 

acquisition and development financing 

as a reit we are required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income to our stockholders consequently we require access to additional sources of capital to fund our growth we expect to maintain a flexible approach to financing growth we plan to finance future acquisitions through a diverse capital optimization strategy which includes but is not limited to cash generated from operations borrowings under our revolving lines of credit the credit lines secured and unsecured financing equity offerings joint ventures and the sale of stores 

credit lines  we have three credit lines which we primarily use as short term bridge financing until we obtain longerterm financing through either debt or equity as of december 31 2020 our credit lines had available capacity of 12 billion of which 2410 million was undrawn 

secured and unsecured debt  historically we had primarily used traditional secured mortgage loans to finance store acquisitions and development efforts more recently we obtain unsecured bank term loans and issue unsecured private placement bonds we will continue to utilize a combination of secured and unsecured financing for future store acquisitions and development as of december 31 2020 we had 22 billion of secured notes payable and 26 billion of unsecured notes payable outstanding compared to 22 billion of secured notes payable and 27 billion of unsecured notes payable and senior exchangeable notes outstanding as of december 31 2019

we view equity interests in our operating partnership as another source of capital that can provide an attractive tax planning opportunity to sellers of real estate we issue common and preferred operating partnership units to sellers in certain acquisitions common operating partnership units receive distributions equal to the dividends on common stock while preferred operating partnership units receive distributions at various negotiated rates we may issue additional units in the future when circumstances are favorable 

joint ventures  as of december 31 2020 we owned 253 of our stores through joint ventures with third parties our joint venture partners typically provide most of the equity capital required for the acquisition of stores owned in these joint ventures most joint venture agreements include buysell rights as well as rights of first offer in connection with the sale of stores by the joint venture we generally manage the daytoday operations of the stores owned in these joint ventures and have the right to participate in major decisions relating to sales of stores or financings by the applicable joint venture but do not control the joint ventures 

sale of properties  we have not historically sold a high volume of stores as we generally believe we are able to optimize the cash flow from stores through continued operations however we may sell more stores or interests in stores in the future in response to changing economic financial or investment conditions for the year ended december 31 2020 we sold four stores located in florida for 466 million for the year ended december 31 2019 we sold one store located in new york for 113 million for the year ended december 31 2018 we sold one store located in california for 402 million

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our securities involves various risks all investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information contained in this annual report before trading in our securities if any of the events set forth in the following risks actually occur our business operating results prospects and financial condition could be harmed 

our performance is subject to risks associated with real estate investments we are a real estate company that derives our income from the operation of our stores there are a number of factors that may adversely affect the income that our stores generate including the following 

risks related to our stores and operations 

adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating results 

our revenues and net operating income can be negatively impacted by general economic factors that lead to a reduction in demand for rental space in the markets in which we operate 

if we are unable to promptly relet our units or if the rates upon such reletting are significantly lower than expected our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

virtually all of our leases are on a monthtomonth basis any delay in reletting units as vacancies arise would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results in addition lower than expected rental rates upon reletting could adversely affect our revenues and impede our growth 

uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flow 

we maintain comprehensive property and casualty insurance policies including liability fire flood earthquake wind as we deem necessary or as required by our lenders umbrella coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our stores certain types of losses however may be either uninsurable not economically insurable or coverage may be excluded on certain policies such as losses due to earthquakes hurricanes tornadoes riots acts of war terrorism or social engineering should an uninsured loss occur we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a store in addition if any such loss is insured we may be required to pay significant amounts on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to our insurer being obligated to reimburse us for the loss or the amount of the loss may exceed our coverage for the loss as a result our operating results may be adversely affected 

legal disputes settlement and defense costs could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

from time to time we have to make monetary settlements or defend actions or arbitration including class actions to resolve tenant employmentrelated or other claims and disputes settling any such liabilities could negatively impact our operating results and cash available for distribution to stockholders and could also adversely affect our ability to sell lease operate or encumber affected properties 

our tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation which may adversely affect our results 

our tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation the regulatory authorities generally have broad discretion to grant renew and revoke licenses and approvals to promulgate interpret and implement regulations and to evaluate compliance with regulations through periodic examinations audits and investigations of the affairs of insurance 

providers as a result of regulatory or private action in any jurisdiction we may be temporarily or permanently suspended from continuing some or all of our reinsurance activities or otherwise fined or penalized or suffer an adverse judgment which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our stores may adversely affect our results of operations 

under various us federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances which could be substantial such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release or presence of such hazardous substances from time to time we may acquire properties or interests in properties with known adverse environmental conditions for which we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior riskadjusted return 

costs associated with complying with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 may result in unanticipated expenses 

under the ada places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons a number of additional us federal state and local laws may also require modifications to our stores or restrict certain further renovations of the stores with respect to access thereto by disabled persons if one or more of our stores is not in compliance with the ada or other legislation then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the facility into compliance 

there is significant competition among selfstorage operators and from other storage alternatives 

competition in the local markets in which many of our stores are located is significant and has affected our occupancy levels rental rates and operating expenses development of selfstorage facilities has increased in recent years which has intensified competition and we expect it will continue to do so as newly developed facilities are opened development of selfstorage facilities by other operators could continue to increase in the future actions by our competitors may decrease or prevent increases in our occupancy and rental rates while increasing our operating expenses which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria which may impede our growth 

our ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy we may not be successful in identifying suitable stores or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms or at all failure to identify or consummate acquisitions will slow our growth which could in turn adversely affect our stock price 

our ability to acquire stores on favorable terms and successfully integrate and operate them may be constrained by the following significant risks 

• competition from local investors and other real estate investors with significant capital including other publiclytraded reits and institutional investment funds 

• competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price which could reduce our profitability 

• the inability to achieve satisfactory completion of due diligence investigations and other customary closing conditions and 

• we may acquire stores subject to liabilities without any recourse or with only limited recourse with respect to unknown liabilities such as liabilities for cleanup of undisclosed environmental contamination claims by persons dealing with the former owners of the stores and claims for indemnification by general partners directors officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the stores 

we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes including financial transactions and records personally identifiable information and tenant and lease data we purchase some of our information technology from vendors on whom our systems depend we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for 

processing transmission and storage of confidential tenant and other sensitive information although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems it is possible that our safety and security measures will not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning or damage or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyberattacks security breaches including physical or electronic breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar breaches can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information while to date we have not experienced a material security breach this risk has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication of such breaches and attempted breaches from around the world have increased any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation divert significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our property taxes could increase due to reassessment or property tax rate changes 

real property taxes on our properties may increase as our properties are reassessed by taxing authorities or as property tax rates change for example a current california law commonly referred to as proposition 13 generally limits annual real estate tax increases on california properties to 2 of assessed value however under proposition 13 property tax reassessment generally occurs as a result of a change in ownership of a property as specially defined for purposes of those rules because the property taxing authorities may not determine whether there has been a change in ownership or the actual reassessed value of a property for a period of time after a transaction has occurred we may not know the impact of a potential reassessment for a considerable amount of time following a particular transaction therefore the amount of property taxes we are required to pay could increase substantially from the property taxes we currently pay or have paid in the past including on a retroactive basis in addition from time to time voters and lawmakers have announced initiatives to repeal or amend proposition 13 to eliminate its application to commercial and industrial property andor introduce split tax roll legislation such initiatives if successful could increase the assessed value andor tax rates applicable to commercial property in california including our stores 

the covid19 pandemic or other pandemics could adversely affect our results of operations 

during 2020 the united states and other countries around the world have been experiencing a major health pandemic related to covid19 which has created considerable instability and disruption in the us and world economies governmental authorities in impacted regions are taking varied and sometimes dramatic action in an effort to slow the spread of covid19 federal state and local jurisdictions have issued varying forms of states of emergency orders we are working to comply within the framework of local county state and federal laws as they evolve in that regard we have implemented a wide range of practices to protect and support our employees and customers such measures include instituting “work from home” measures at our corporate offices and call center instituting a contactless rental process that allows our onsite employees to continue to rent storage units without physical interaction and providing personal protective equipment to onsite employees providing essential functions so that hygiene and “social distancing” standards can be effectively managed and applied we have transitioned many of our interactions between customers and leasing and support staff to online and telephonic communications due to the covid19 pandemic our customers may be impacted including through unemployment which may impact their ability to pay rent or renew their leases 

our business has been impacted by covid19 in several ways including reductions in new rentals and vacates due to stayat home orders and other restrictions lower achieved rental rates from new customers fewer existing customer rent increases reduced late fee collection and impaired ability to hold auctions resulting in higher accounts receivable and bad debt these impacts from covid19 were especially prevalent during the second quarter of 2020 as restrictions began to lessen during the second half of 2020 we saw some return toward normalcy including higher achieved rates accounts receivable and collections less than 60 days returning to historical norms and auctions being held in most locations as a result of the reductions in vacates we saw record occupancy levels in the latter half of 2020 

although the selfstorage industry has historically been resilient to ordinary market downturns the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the us and world economies generally and on our future results in particular could be significant and will largely depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted this includes new information which may emerge concerning the severity of covid19 the success of actions taken to contain or treat covid19 and reactions by consumers companies governmental entities and capital markets 

risks related to our organization and structure 

conflicts of interest could arise as a result of our relationship with our operating partnership 

conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates and our operating partnership or any partner thereof our directors and officers have duties to our company under applicable maryland law in connection with their management of our company at the same time we through our whollyowned subsidiary have fiduciary duties as a general partner to our operating partnership and to the limited partners under delaware law in connection with the management of our operating partnership our duties through our whollyowned subsidiary as a general partner to our operating partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our company the partnership agreement of our operating partnership does not require us to resolve such conflicts in favor of either our company or the limited partners in our operating partnership unless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement delaware law generally requires a general partner of a delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith fairness and loyalty and which generally prohibit such general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest 

additionally the partnership agreement expressly limits our liability by providing that neither we our direct whollyowned massachusetts business trust subsidiary as the general partner of the operating partnership nor any of our or their trustees directors or officers will be liable or accountable in damages to our operating partnership the limited partners or assignees for errors in judgment mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if we or such trustee director or officer acted in good faith in addition our operating partnership is required to indemnify us our affiliates and each of our respective trustees officers directors employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against any and all losses claims damages liabilities whether joint or several expenses including without limitation attorneys’ fees and other legal fees and expenses judgments fines settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims demands actions suits or proceedings civil criminal administrative or investigative that relate to the operations of the operating partnership provided that our operating partnership will not indemnify for 1 willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law 2 any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement or 3 in the case of a criminal proceeding the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful 

the provisions of delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement 

our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority 

as of december 31 2020 we held interests in 253 operating stores through joint ventures some of these arrangements could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority our reliance on coventurers financial conditions and disputes between us and our coventurers we expect to continue our joint venture strategy by entering into more joint ventures for the purpose of developing new stores and acquiring existing stores in such event we would not be in a position to exercise sole decisionmaking authority regarding the property partnership joint venture or other entity the decisionmaking authority regarding the stores we currently hold through joint ventures is either vested exclusively with our joint venture partners is subject to a majority vote of the joint venture partners or is equally shared by us and the joint venture partners in addition investments in partnerships joint ventures or other entities may under certain circumstances involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or coventurers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions partners or coventurers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions such as a sale because neither we nor the partner or coventurer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or coventurers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers andor directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or coventurers might result in subjecting stores owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our thirdparty partners or coventurers which could harm our financial condition 

certain provisions of maryland law and our organizational documents including the stock ownership limit imposed by our charter may inhibit market activity in our stock and could prevent or delay a change in control transaction 

our charter subject to certain exceptions authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a reit and to limit any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 70 by value 

or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding common stock or 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limit however our board of directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership limit to any proposed transferee whose ownership could jeopardize our qualification as a reit these restrictions on ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the ownership limit may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders different ownership limits apply to the family of kenneth m woolley certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing to spencer f kirk certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and to certain designated investment entities as defined in our charter 

our board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder approval in addition our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares our board of directors could issue additional shares of our common stock or establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise not be in the best interests of our stockholders 

our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited 

maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances in addition our charter eliminates our directors’ and officers’ liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law as a result we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law in addition we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers 

risks related to our debt financings 

disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us 

uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to refinance existing debt maturities on favorable terms or at all which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions and fund development projects a downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell stores or may adversely affect the price we receive for stores that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing 

required payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our stores or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 58 billion of outstanding indebtedness we may incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions and development we may borrow under our credit lines or borrow new funds to finance these future stores additionally we do not anticipate that our internally generated cash flow will be adequate to repay our existing indebtedness upon maturity and therefore we expect to repay our indebtedness through refinancings and equity andor debt offerings further we may need to borrow funds in order to make cash distributions to maintain our qualification as a reit or to make our expected distributions to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income each year determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains and we are subject to us federal corporate income tax to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income each year determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and including net capital gains 

if we are required to utilize our credit lines for purposes other than acquisition activity this will reduce the amount available for acquisitions and could slow our growth therefore our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences including the following 

• our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments 

• we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms including to make acquisitions or to continue to make distributions required to maintain our qualification as a reit 

• we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness 

• because a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates an increase in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense 

• we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our stores possibly on disadvantageous terms 

• after debt service the amount available for cash distributions to our stockholders is reduced 

• we may experience increased vulnerability to economic and industry downturns reducing our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions 

• we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our stores that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases andor enforce our guarantees 

• we may violate restrictive covenants in our loan documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations and 

• our default under any one of our mortgage loans with crossdefault or crosscollateralization provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness or result in the foreclosures of other stores 

increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and make cash distributions to our stockholders 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 58 billion of debt outstanding of which approximately 21 billion or 369 was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps this variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 16 per annum increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase our interest expense which could harm our cash flow and our ability to pay cash distributions 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations 

in certain cases we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements hedging involves risks such as the risk that the counterparty may fail to honor its obligations under an arrangement failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders 

uncertainty relating to the libor calculation process and potential phasing out of libor may affect our financial results 

in july 2017 the financial conduct authority the authority that regulates libor announced it intended to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after june 30 2021 the alternative reference rates committee “arrc” has proposed that the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to libor for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to libor arrc has proposed a paced market transition plan to sofr from libor and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to libor in november 2020 the federal reserve board along with various independent groups announced the potential for certain usd libor tenors to continue to be published until june 2023 this change would allow most legacy usd libor contracts to mature before disruptions occur in the usd libor market without the need to transition those contracts to sofr we are not able to predict when libor may be limited or discontinued or when there will be sufficient liquidity in the sofr market 

we have outstanding debt and hedge contracts indexed to libor due to the extension noted above we currently expect that all of our thenoutstanding contracts indexed to libor will be required to be transitioned to an alternative rate by june 30 2023 however it is possible that libor may be discontinued or our contracts may be transitioned to an alternative rate which may or may not be a sofrbased rate prior to then we are monitoring industry transition plans and evaluating the risks related to our debt and hedge contracts indexed to libor if a published us dollar libor rate is unavailable after 2021 the interest rates on these instruments which are indexed to libor will be determined using alternative methods which may result in interest obligations which are more than or do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made on such debt if us dollar libor was available in its current form further the same costs and risks that may lead to the unavailability of us dollar libor may make one or more of the alternative methods impossible or impracticable to 

determine any of these proposals or consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financing costs and as a result our financial condition operating results and cash flows 

risks related to qualification and operation as a reit 

dividends payable by reits may be taxed at higher rates 

dividends payable by reits may be taxed at higher rates than dividends of nonreit corporations the maximum us federal income tax rate for qualified dividends paid by domestic nonreit corporations to us stockholders that are individuals trust or estates is generally 20 dividends paid by reits to such stockholders are generally not eligible for that rate but under current tax law such stockholders may deduct up to 20 of ordinary dividends ie dividends not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income received from a reit for taxable years beginning before january 1 2026 although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by reits such tax rate may still be higher than the tax rate applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends this may cause investors to view reit investments as less attractive than investments in nonreit corporations which in turn may adversely affect the value of stock of reits including our stock in addition the relative attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends which could negatively affect the value of our stores 

possible legislative or other actions affecting reits could adversely affect our stockholders 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue service irs and the us department of the treasury changes to the tax laws with or without retroactive application could adversely affect our investors or us in ways we cannot predict new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit the us federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the us federal income tax consequences of an investment in us also the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities or an investment in other entities could change making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit 

our failure to qualify as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock 

we believe we operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit or lose our qualification as a reit at any time we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution for each of the years involved because 

  

• we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to us federal corporate income tax on our taxable income 

• we also could be subject to the us federal alternative minimum income tax for taxable years prior to 2018 and possibly increased state and local taxes and 

• unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following a year during which we were disqualified 

in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits this means that our us individual stockholders would be taxed on our dividends at capital gains rates and our us corporate stockholders would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends subject in each case to applicable limitations under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes and are able to avail ourselves of one or more of the relief provisions under the internal revenue code in order to maintain our reit status we may nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of 50000 or more for each such failure as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our securities 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the internal revenue code is greater in the case of a reit that like us holds its assets through a partnership the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the composition of our assets the sources of our gross income and the owners of our stock our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market value of our assets some of which are not susceptible to precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals our ability to satisfy the income tests depends on the sources and amounts of our gross income which we may not be able to control also we must

we own and may acquire direct or indirect interests in entities that have elected or will elect to be taxed as reits under the internal revenue code each a “subsidiary reit” a subsidiary reit is subject to the various reit qualification requirements and other limitations described herein that are applicable to us if a subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit then i that subsidiary reit would become subject to us federal income tax ii shares in such subsidiary reit would cease to be qualifying assets for purposes of the asset tests applicable to reits and iii it is possible that we would fail certain of the asset tests applicable to reits in which event we would fail to qualify as a reit unless we could avail ourselves of certain relief provisions 

in addition legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors our ability to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that is intended to allow us to qualify for taxation as a reit we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the irs regarding our qualification as a reit

 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2020 we owned or had ownership interests in 1197 operating stores of these stores 944 are whollyowned six are in consolidated joint ventures and 247 are in unconsolidated joint ventures in addition we managed 724 stores for third parties bringing the total number of stores which we own andor manage to 1921 these stores are located in 40 states washington dc and puerto rico the majority of our stores are clustered around large population centers the clustering of assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale our acquisitions have given us an increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in many markets where we had no previous presence 

as of december 31 2020 approximately 1135000 tenants were leasing storage units at the operating stores that we own andor manage primarily on a monthtomonth basis providing the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit existing tenants generally receive rate increases at least annually for which no direct correlation has been drawn to our vacancy trends although leases are shortterm in duration the typical tenant tends to remain at our stores for an extended period of time for stores that were stabilized as of december 31 2020 the average length of stay was approximately 154 months 

the average annual rent per square foot for our existing customers at stabilized stores net of discounts and bad debt was 1633 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 1639 for the year ended december 31 2019 average annual rent per square foot for new leases was 1481 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 1488 for the year ended december 31 2019 the average discounts as a percentage of rental revenues during these periods were 31 and 36 respectively 

our store portfolio is made up of different types of construction and building configurations most often sites are what we consider “hybrid” facilities a mix of both driveup buildings and multifloor buildings we have a number of multifloor buildings with elevator access only and a number of facilities featuring groundfloor access only

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report we make statements in this section that are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws for a complete discussion of forwardlooking statements see the section in this form 10k entitled “statements regarding forwardlooking information” certain risk factors may cause actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion for a discussion of such risk factors see the section in this form 10k entitled “risk factors” dollar amounts in thousands except share and per share data unless otherwise stated 

overview 

we are a fully integrated selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust “reit” formed to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop selfstorage properties “stores” we derive substantially all of our revenues from our two segments storage operations and tenant reinsurance primary sources of revenue for our storage operations segment include rents received from tenants under leases at each of our whollyowned stores our operating results depend materially on our ability to lease available selfstorage units to actively manage unit rental rates and on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments consequently management spends a significant portion of their time maximizing cash flows from our diverse portfolio of stores revenue from our tenant reinsurance segment consists of insurance revenues from the reinsurance of risks relating to the loss of goods stored by tenants in our stores 

our stores are generally situated in highly visible locations clustered around large population centers the clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale to maximize the performance of our stores we employ industryleading revenue management systems developed by our management team these systems enable us to analyze set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions we believe our systems and processes allow us to more proactively manage revenues 

we operate in competitive markets often where consumers have multiple stores from which to choose competition has impacted and will continue to impact our store results we experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity we believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the combination of our revenue management team and our industryleading technology systems we consider a store to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization we consider a store to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 of the current year or has been open for three years prior to january 1 of the current year 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those that impact our most critical accounting policies we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances a summary of significant accounting policies is also provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements actual results may differ from these estimates we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies and estimates 

consolidation arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as variable interest entities “vies” an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it is the primary beneficiary of the vie 

under certain circumstances when we enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures a vie may be created the primary factors that require the most judgment in determining whether the joint venture is a vie are whether the decisions that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance were controlled by the equity holders as a group and whether the joint venture has sufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated support 

if the joint venture is determined to be a vie we perform a qualitative analysis including considering which party if any has the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of each vie and whether that party has the obligation to absorb losses of the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could be significant to the vie if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie the assets liabilities and operations of the vie are consolidated within 

our financial statements otherwise our investment is generally accounted for under the equity method our ability to correctly assess the influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of the investment in our consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we had no consolidated vies 

real estate assets we account for the acquisition of stores including by merger and other acquisitions of real estate in accordance with asc 80510  business combinations we use our judgment to determine if assets acquired meet the definition of a business or if the acquisition should be considered an asset acquisition we must make significant assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired and consideration transferred these fair value estimates are sensitive to price of land per square foot and current replacement cost estimates including adjustments for the age class height square footage condition location and turnkey factor these assumptions and estimates require judgment and therefore others could come to materially different conclusions as to the estimated fair values which could result in differences in depreciation and amortization expense gains and losses on the sale of real estate assets and real estate and intangible asset values 

evaluation of asset impairment long lived assets held for use are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment we review each store at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist we focus on stores where occupancy andor rental income have decreased by a significant amount for these stores we determine whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the store will likely recover the lost occupancy andor revenue in the short term in addition we review stores in the leaseup stage and compare actual operating results to original projections we may not have identified all material facts and circumstances that affect impairment of our stores no material impairments were recorded in the year ended december 31 2020 

derivative instruments and hedging activities we hold a number of derivative instruments which we use to hedge our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows mainly related to our interest rates on variable interest debt we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes we assess our derivatives both at inception and on an ongoing quarterly basis for whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are effective the rules and interpretations relating to the accounting for derivatives are complex failure to apply this guidance correctly may require us to recognize all changes in fair value of the hedged derivative in earnings which may materially impact our results 

income taxes we have elected to be treated as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code in order to maintain our qualification as a reit among other things we are required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets as a reit we are not subject to us federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to our stockholders we plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex for any taxable year that we fail to qualify as a reit and for which applicable statutory relief provisions did not apply we would be subject to us federal corporate income tax on all of our taxable income for at least that year and the ensuing four years we could also be subject to penalties and interest and our net income may be materially different from the amounts reported in our financial statements 

we have elected to treat certain corporate subsidiaries including extra space management inc as a trs in general a trs may perform additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or nonreal estate related business a trs is subject to us federal corporate income tax and may also be subject to state and local income taxes interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense when incurred if tax authorities determine that amounts paid by any of our trss to us are not reasonable compared to similar arrangements among unrelated parties we could be subject to a penalty tax on the excess payments

revenues 

the following table presents information on revenues earned for the years indicated 



property rental— the increase in property rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily the result of an increase of 25242 associated with acquisitions completed in 2020 and 2019 we acquired 23 stores during the year ended december 31 2020 and we acquired 21 stores and added 27 leased properties as part of a new net lease agreement during the year ended december 31 2019 property rental revenue also increased by 3755 during the year ended december 31 2020 as a result of increases in occupancy at our leaseup stores which was partially offset by a decrease of 1301 at our stabilized stores 

tenant reinsurance —the increase in tenant reinsurance revenues was due primarily to an increase in the number of stores operated and the higher occupancy at both our lease up and mature sites we operated 1921 stores at december 31 2020 compared to 1817 stores at december 31 2019 

management fees and other income —management fees and other income represent the fee collected for our management of stores owned by third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures and other transaction fee income the increase for the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily due to an increase in the number of stores managed offset by nonrecurring transaction fees earned in 2019 as of december 31 2020 we managed 977 stores for third parties and joint ventures compared to 892 stores as of december 31 2019

tenant reinsurance —tenant reinsurance expense represents the costs that are incurred to provide tenant reinsurance the decrease in tenant reinsurance expense for the year ended december 31 2020 was due primarily to a reduction in the number of claims as well as a decrease in the overall average payout on individual claims when compared to the year ended december 31 2019 

general and administrative— general and administrative expenses primarily include all expenses not directly related to our stores including corporate payroll travel and professional fees these expenses are recognized as incurred during the year ended december 31 2020 we recorded an additional 1823 in compensation expense as a result of modifications to the terms of the stockbased awards related to the retirement of an executive in june 2020 we did not observe any material trends in specific payroll travel or other expenses that contributed significantly to the increase in general and administrative expenses apart from the increase due to the management of additional stores 

depreciation and amortization —depreciation and amortization expense increased as a result of the acquisition of new stores we acquired 23 stores and completed the development of a consolidated joint venture store during the year ended december 31 2020 and acquired 21 operating stores during the year ended december 31 2019 

other income and expenses

interest expense— the decrease in interest expense during the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily the result of a lower average interest rate when compared to the same period in the prior year information on the total face value of debt and the average interest rate for each quarter during the years ended december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 is set forth in the following table 



noncash interest expense related to amortization of discount on equity component of exchangeable senior notes— represents the amortization of the discounts related to the equity components of the exchangeable senior notes issued by our operating partnership the exchangeable senior notes both had an effective interest rate of 40 relative to the carrying amount of the liability as of december 31 2020 the exchangeable senior notes were paid off in full 

interest income— interest income represents amounts earned on cash and cash equivalents deposited with financial institutions interest earned on bridge loans and debt securities and income earned on notes receivable from common and preferred operating partnership unit holders in late 2018 we began to provide bridge financing on completed properties owned by third parties that we manage the total principal balance of bridge loans receivable as of december 31 2020 was 187368 compared to 43586 as of december 31 2019 we also purchased a senior mezzanine note receivable with a principal amount of 103000 in july 2020 the increase in interest income during the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily the result of interest earned on these loans as well as interest earned from our investment in preferred stock of jernigan capital inc jcap in connection with the acquisition of jcap by affiliates of nexpoint advisors lp which was purchased in november 2020 for 300000 

equity in earnings and dividend income from unconsolidated real estate entities— equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures represents the income earned through our ownership interests in unconsolidated real estate ventures in joint ventures we and our joint venture partners generally receive a preferred return on our invested capital to the extent that cash or profits in excess of these preferred returns are generated we receive a higher percentage of the excess cash or profits as applicable dividend income represents dividends from our investment in convertible preferred stock of smartstop which was purchased in october 2019 for 150000 with another 50000 invested in october 2020 the increase in earnings for the year ended december 31 2020 is due primarily to the dividend income related to the smartstop preferred stock

comparison of the year ended december 31 2019 to the year ended december 31 2018 

the results of operations for the years ended december 31 2019 compared to december 31 2018 was included in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 on page 18 under part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which was filed with the sec on february 25 2020 

funds from operations 

funds from operations ffo provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary along with net income and cash flows for an understanding of our operating results we believe ffo is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings net earnings assume that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses the values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and we believe ffo more accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts inc “nareit” as net income computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” excluding gains or losses on sales of operating stores and impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate assets plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis we believe that to further understand our performance ffo should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with gaap as presented in the 

consolidated financial statements ffo should not be considered a replacement of net income computed in accordance with gaap 

the computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions 

the following table presents the calculation of ffo for the periods indicated 



samestore results 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2020 to the year ended december 31 2019 

our samestore pool for the periods presented consists of 859 stores that are whollyowned and operated and that were stabilized by the first day of the earliest calendar year presented we consider a store to be stabilized once it has been open for three years or has sustained average square foot occupancy of 80 or more for one calendar year we believe that by providing samestore results from a stabilized pool of stores with accompanying operating metrics including but not limited to occupancy rental revenue growth operating expense growth net operating income growth etc stockholders and potential investors are able to evaluate operating performance without the effects of nonstabilized occupancy levels rent levels expense levels acquisitions or completed developments samestore results should not be used as a basis for future samestore performance or for the performance of our stores as a whole the following table presents operating data for our samestore portfolio 





samestore revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 were essentially flat due to higher average occupancy partially offset by lower rental rates to existing customers lower late fees and higher bad debt expense related to nonpaying tenants expenses were higher for the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to increases in payroll marketing expenses and property taxes partially offset by reduced utilities expense and repairs and maintenance 

the following table presents a reconciliation of samestore net operating income to net income as presented on our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated 



comparison of the year ended december 31 2019 to the year ended december 31 2018 

the same store results for the years ended december 31 2019 compared to december 31 2018 was included in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 on page 22 under part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which was filed with the sec on february 25 2020 

cash flows 

cash flows from operating activities increased as expected due to our continued growth in revenues and through the increase in the number of properties we own and operate cash flows used in investing activities relate primarily to our acquisitions and development of new stores sales of stores investments in unconsolidated real estate entities and notes receivable from bridge loans and fluctuate depending on our actions in those areas cash flows from financing activities depend primarily on our debt and equity financing activities a summary of cash flows along with significant components are as follows 



we believe that cash flows generated by operations along with our existing cash and cash equivalents the availability of funds under our existing lines of credit and our access to capital markets will be sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during the next twelve months these cash needs include operating expenses monthly debt service payments recurring capital expenditures acquisitions funding for new notes receivable for bridge loans building redevelopments and expansions distributions to unit holders and dividends to stockholders necessary to maintain our reit qualification 

we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2020 and we consider these projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash these cash flows are principally derived from rents paid by our tenants a significant deterioration in projected cash flows from operations could cause us to increase our reliance on available funds under our existing lines of credit curtail planned capital expenditures or seek other additional sources of financing 

liquidity and capital resources 

financing strategy 

we will continue to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts reviewed from time to time by our board of directors although our board of directors has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur we will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or variable rate in making financing decisions we will consider factors including but not limited to 

  

• the interest rate of the proposed financing 

• the extent to which the financing impacts flexibility in managing our stores 

• prepayment penalties and restrictions on refinancing 

• the purchase price of stores acquired with debt financing 

• longterm objectives with respect to the financing 

• target investment returns 

• the ability of particular stores and our company as a whole to generate cash flow sufficient to cover expected debt service payments 

• overall level of consolidated indebtedness 

• timing of debt maturities 

• provisions that require recourse and crosscollateralization and 

• corporate credit ratios including fixed charge coverage ratio and max securedunsecured indebtedness 

our indebtedness may be recourse nonrecourse crosscollateralized crossdefaulted secured or unsecured in addition we may invest in stores subject to existing loans collateralized by mortgages or similar liens or may refinance stores acquired on a leveraged basis we may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness to refinance investments including the redevelopment of existing stores for general working capital or to purchase additional interests in partnerships or joint ventures or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable 

as of december 31 2020 we had 109124 available in cash and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts during 2020 and 2019 we experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash or cash equivalents however there can be no assurance that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 

as of december 31 2020 we had 5767771 face value of debt resulting in a debt to total enterprise value ratio of 275 as of december 31 2019 we had 5076501 face value of debt resulting in a debt total enterprise value ratio of 259 as of december 31 2020 the ratio of total fixedrate debt and other instruments to total debt was 631 including 2091269 on which we have interest rate swaps that have been included as fixedrate debt as of december 31 2019 the ratio of total fixedrate debt and other instruments to total debt was 787 including 2290356 on which we have interest rate swaps that have been included as fixedrate debt the weighted average interest rate of total debt at december 31 2020 and 2019 was 27 and 33 respectively 

in july 2019 we obtained a bbbstable rating from sp and in january 2021 we received a baa2 rating from moodys investors service we intend to manage our balance sheet to preserve such ratings certain of our real estate assets are pledged as collateral for our debt we are subject to certain restrictive covenants relating to our outstanding debt we were in compliance with all financial covenants at december 31 2020 

we expect to fund our shortterm liquidity requirements including operating expenses recurring capital expenditures dividends to stockholders distributions to holders of operating partnership units and interest on our outstanding indebtedness out of our operating cash flow cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving lines of credit in addition we are pursuing additional sources of financing based on anticipated funding needs 

our liquidity needs consist primarily of operating expenses monthly debt service payments recurring capital expenditures distributions to unit holders and dividends to stockholders necessary to maintain our reit qualification we may from time to time seek to repurchase our outstanding debt shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors in addition we evaluate on an ongoing basis the merits of strategic acquisitions and other relationships which may require us to raise additional funds we may also use operating partnership units as currency to fund acquisitions from selfstorage owners who desire taxdeferral in their exiting transactions 

contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2020 the weighted average interest rate for all fixed rate debt was 34 and the weighted average interest rate on all variable rate debt was 16 

for more information on our contractual obligations related to real estate acquisitions refer to our commitments and contingencies footnote in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

seasonality 

the selfstorage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations a greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from may through september historically our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of july while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early march results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our future income cash flows and fair values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary and tax policies domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 5767771 in total face value debt of which approximately 2130551 was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 21306 annually 

interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur further in the event of a change of that magnitude we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure 

derivative instruments 

we use derivative instruments to help manage interest rate risk using designated hedge relationships interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixedrate and variablerate interest payments between two parties based on a contractual underlying notional amount but do not involve the exchange of the underlying notional amounts see our derivatives footnote in our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information about our use of derivative contracts

we were formed to continue the business of extra space storage llc and its subsidiaries which had engaged in the selfstorage business since 1977 these companies were reorganized after the consummation of our ipo and various formation transactions as of december 31 2019 we owned andor operated 1817 stores in 40 states washington dc and puerto rico comprising approximately 140 million square feet of net rentable space in approximately 13 million units 

we operate in two distinct segments 1 selfstorage operations and 2 tenant reinsurance our selfstorage operations activities include rental operations of whollyowned stores tenant reinsurance activities include the reinsurance of risks relating to the loss of goods stored by tenants in our stores for more information and comparative financial and other information on our reportable business segments refer to the segment information footnote in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

substantially all of our business is conducted through extra space storage lp the “operating partnership” our primary assets are general partner and limited partner interests in the operating partnership this structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership reit or upreit we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “internal revenue code” to the extent we continue to qualify as a reit we will not be subject to us federal tax with certain exceptions on our reit taxable income that is distributed to our stockholders 

we file our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and all amendments to those reports with the securities and exchange commission the “sec” you may obtain copies of these documents by visiting the sec’s website at wwwsecgov in addition as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are furnished to the sec we make copies of these documents available to the public free of charge through our website at wwwextraspacecom or by contacting our secretary at our principal offices which are located at 2795 east cottonwood parkway suite 300 salt lake city utah 84121 telephone number 801 3654600 

management 

members of our executive management team have significant experience in all aspects of the selfstorage industry our executive management team and their years of industry experience are as follows joseph d margolis chief executive officer 15 years scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer 19 years samrat sondhi executive vice president and chief operating officer 17 years gwyn mcneal executive vice president and chief legal officer 14 years james overturf executive vice president and chief marketing officer 21 years 

our executive management team and board of directors have an ownership position in the company with executive officers and directors owning approximately 3418462 shares or 26 of our outstanding common stock as of february 19 2020  

industry  competition 

stores offer monthtomonth rental of storage space for personal or business use tenants typically rent fully enclosed spaces that vary in size and typically range from 5 feet by 5 feet to 20 feet by 20 feet with an interior height of 8 feet to 12 feet tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units stores generally have onsite managers who supervise and run the daytoday operations providing tenants with assistance as needed 

selfstorage provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions due to life changes or simply because of a need for storage space the mix of residential tenants using a store is determined by a store’s local demographics and often includes people who are experiencing life changes such as downsizing their living space or others who are not yet settled into a permanent residence items that tenants place in selfstorage are typically furniture household items 

and appliances commercial tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods records inventory or storage for seasonal goods 

our research has shown that tenants choose a store based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or business making highdensity hightraffic population centers ideal locations for stores a store’s visibility on the internet price perceived security cleanliness and the general professionalism of the store managers and staff are also contributing factors to a store’s ability to successfully secure rentals although most stores are leased to tenants on a monthtomonth basis tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time 

the selfstorage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations a greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from may through september historically our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of july while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early march 

since inception in the early 1970’s the selfstorage industry has experienced significant growth the selfstorage industry has also seen increases in occupancy over the past several years according to the selfstorage almanac the “almanac” in 2014 the national average physical occupancy rate was 891 of net rentable square feet compared to an average physical occupancy rate of 910 in 2019 

the industry is also characterized by fragmented ownership according to the almanac as of the end of 2019  the top ten selfstorage companies in the united states operated approximately 206 of the total us stores and the top 50 selfstorage companies operated approximately 267 of the total us stores we believe this fragmentation will contribute to continued consolidation at some level in the future 

we believe that we are well positioned to compete for acquisitions we have encountered competition when we have sought to acquire existing operating stores especially for brokered portfolios competitive bidding practices have been commonplace between both public and private entities and this will likely continue 

we are the second largest selfstorage operator in the united states we are one of five public selfstorage reits along with cubesmart life storage national storage affiliates and public storage 

longterm growth and investment strategies 

our primary business objectives are to maximize cash flow available for distribution to our stockholders and to achieve sustainable longterm growth in cash flow per share in order to maximize longterm stockholder value both at acceptable levels of risk we continue to evaluate a range of growth initiatives and opportunities our primary strategies include the following 

maximize the performance of our stores through strategic efficient and proactive management 

we pursue revenuegenerating and expenseminimizing opportunities in our operations our revenue management team seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our advanced technology systems ability to provide realtime interactive rental rate and discount management our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement more effective online marketing programs which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost 

we continually analyze our portfolio to look for longterm valueenhancing opportunities we proactively redevelop properties to add units or modify existing unit mix to better meet the demand in a given market and to maximize revenue we also redevelop properties to reduce their effective useful age increase visual appeal enhance security and to improve brand consistency across the portfolio 

acquire selfstorage stores 

our acquisitions team continues to pursue the acquisition of multistore portfolios and single stores that we believe can provide stockholder value we have established a reputation as a reliable ethical buyer which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions in addition we believe our status as an upreit enables flexibility when structuring deals we remain a disciplined buyer and only execute acquisitions that we believe will strengthen our portfolio and increase stockholder value 

in addition to the pursuit of stabilized stores from time to time we develop stores from the ground up and provide the construction capital we also purchase stores at the completion of construction from third party developers who build to our specifications these stores purchased at completion of construction a certificate of occupancy store create additional long term value for our stockholders we are typically able to acquire these assets at a lower price than a stabilized store and 

expect greater long term returns on these stores on average however in the short term these acquisitions cause dilution to our earnings during the twotofour year period required to lease up the certificate of occupancy stores we expect that this trend will continue in 2020 as we continue to acquire certificate of occupancy stores 

expand our management business 

our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees as well as expand our geographic footprint data sophistication and scale with little capital investment we believe this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale in addition we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline we pursue strategic relationships with owners whose stores would enhance our portfolio in the event an opportunity arises to acquire such stores to broaden the opportunities available we have recently implemented a bridge lending program under which we provide financing to operating properties that we manage we anticipate that this program will help us increase our management business create additional future acquisition opportunities and strengthen our relationships with partners all while providing interest income the total balance of bridge loans receivable as of december 31 2019 was 436 million 

financing of our longterm growth strategies 

acquisition and development financing 

as a reit we are required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income to our stockholders consequently we require access to additional sources of capital to fund our growth we expect to maintain a flexible approach to financing growth we plan to finance future acquisitions through a diverse capital optimization strategy which includes but is not limited to cash generated from operations borrowings under our revolving lines of credit the credit lines secured and unsecured financing equity offerings joint ventures and the sale of stores 

credit lines  we have two credit lines which we primarily use as short term bridge financing until we obtain longerterm financing through either debt or equity as of december 31 2019  our credit lines had available capacity of 7900 million  of which 6320 million was undrawn 

secured and unsecured debt  historically we had primarily used traditional secured mortgage loans to finance store acquisitions and development efforts more recently we obtain unsecured bank term loans and issue unsecured private placement bonds we will continue to utilize a combination of secured and unsecured financing for future store acquisitions and development as of december 31 2019  we had 22 billion of secured notes payable and 27 billion of unsecured notes payable and senior exchangeable notes outstanding compared to 29 billion of secured notes payable and 19 billion of unsecured notes payable and senior exchangeable notes outstanding as of december 31 2018  

equity  we have an active at the market atm program for selling stock we sell stock under the atm program from time to time to raise capital when we believe conditions are advantageous during the year ended december 31 2019  we issued 1779200 shares of common stock through our atm program and received net proceeds of approximately 1988 million during the year ended december 31 2018  we issued 933789 shares of common stock through our atm program and received net proceeds of approximately 902 million 

we view equity interests in our operating partnership as another source of capital that can provide an attractive tax planning opportunity to sellers of real estate we issue common and preferred operating partnership units to sellers in certain acquisitions common operating partnership units receive distributions equal to the dividends on common stock while preferred operating partnership units receive distributions at various negotiated rates we may issue additional units in the future when circumstances are favorable 

joint venture financing  as of december 31 2019  we owned 246 of our stores through joint ventures with third parties our joint venture partners typically provide most of the equity capital required for the acquisition of stores owned in these joint ventures most joint venture agreements include buysell rights as well as rights of first offer in connection with the sale of stores by the joint venture we generally manage the daytoday operations of the stores owned in these joint ventures and have the right to participate in major decisions relating to sales of stores or financings by the applicable joint venture but do not control the joint ventures 

sale of properties  we have not historically sold a high volume of stores as we generally believe we are able to optimize the cash flow from stores through continued operations however we may sell more stores or interests in stores in the future in response to changing economic financial or investment conditions for the year ended december 31 2019 we sold one store located in new york for 113 million for the year ended december 31 2018  we sold one store located in california for 402 million 

regulation 

generally stores are subject to various laws ordinances and regulations including regulations relating to lien sale rights and procedures and the americans with disabilities act of 1990 changes in any of these laws or regulations as well as changes in laws such as the comprehensive environmental response and compensation liability act which increase the potential liability for environmental conditions or circumstances existing or created by tenants or others on stores or laws affecting development construction operation upkeep safety and taxation may result in significant unanticipated expenditures loss of stores or other impairments to operations which would adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition noncompliance with any of these laws ordinances or regulations could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could require substantial capital expenditures to ensure compliance 

insurance activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state in accordance with the mccarranferguson act and are subject to the grammleachbliley act and the privacy regulations promulgated by the federal trade commission pursuant thereto store management activities may be subject to state real estate brokerage laws and regulations as determined by the particular real estate commission for each state changes in any of the laws governing our conduct could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business or could materially affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

employees 

as of december 31 2019  we had 4048 employees and believe our relationship with our employees is good our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement 




 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our securities involves various risks all investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information contained in this annual report before trading in our securities if any of the events set forth in the following risks actually occur our business operating results prospects and financial condition could be harmed 

our performance is subject to risks associated with real estate investments we are a real estate company that derives our income from the operation of our stores there are a number of factors that may adversely affect the income that our stores generate including the following 

risks related to our stores and operations 

adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating results 

our revenues and net operating income can be negatively impacted by general economic factors that lead to a reduction in demand for rental space in the markets in which we operate 

if we are unable to promptly relet our units or if the rates upon such reletting are significantly lower than expected our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

virtually all of our leases are on a monthtomonth basis any delay in reletting units as vacancies arise would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results in addition lower than expected rental rates upon reletting could adversely affect our revenues and impede our growth 

uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flow 

we maintain comprehensive property and casualty insurance policies including liability fire flood earthquake wind as we deem necessary or as required by our lenders umbrella coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our stores certain types of losses however may be either uninsurable not economically insurable or coverage may be excluded on certain policies such as losses due to earthquakes hurricanes tornadoes riots acts of war terrorism or social engineering should an uninsured loss occur we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a store in addition if any such loss is insured we may be required to pay significant amounts on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to our insurer being obligated to reimburse us for the loss or the amount of the loss may exceed our coverage for the loss as a result our operating results may be adversely affected 

legal disputes settlement and defense costs could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

from time to time we have to make monetary settlements or defend actions or arbitration including class actions to resolve tenant employmentrelated or other claims and disputes settling any such liabilities could negatively impact our operating results and cash available for distribution to stockholders and could also adversely affect our ability to sell lease operate or encumber affected properties 

our tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation which may adversely affect our results 

our tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation the regulatory authorities generally have broad discretion to grant renew and revoke licenses and approvals to promulgate interpret and implement regulations and to evaluate compliance with regulations through periodic examinations audits and investigations of the affairs of insurance providers as a result of regulatory or private action in any jurisdiction we may be temporarily or permanently suspended from continuing some or all of our reinsurance activities or otherwise fined or penalized or suffer an adverse judgment which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our stores may adversely affect our results of operations 

under various us federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances which could be substantial such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release or presence of such hazardous substances from time to time we may acquire properties or interests in properties with known adverse environmental conditions for which we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior riskadjusted return 

costs associated with complying with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 may result in unanticipated expenses 

under the ada places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons a number of additional us federal state and local laws may also require modifications to our stores or restrict certain further renovations of the stores with respect to access thereto by disabled persons if one or more of our stores is not in compliance with the ada or other legislation then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the facility into compliance 

there is significant competition among selfstorage operators and from other storage alternatives 

competition in the local markets in which many of our stores are located is significant and has affected our occupancy levels rental rates and operating expenses development of selfstorage facilities has increased in recent years which has intensified competition and we expect it will continue to do so as newly developed facilities are opened development of selfstorage facilities by other operators could continue to increase in the future actions by our competitors may decrease or prevent increases in our occupancy and rental rates while increasing our operating expenses which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria which may impede our growth 

our ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy we may not be successful in identifying suitable stores or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions 

or investments on satisfactory terms or at all failure to identify or consummate acquisitions will slow our growth which could in turn adversely affect our stock price 

our ability to acquire stores on favorable terms and successfully integrate and operate them may be constrained by the following significant risks 

 we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes including financial transactions and records personally identifiable information and tenant and lease data we purchase some of our information technology from vendors on whom our systems depend we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential tenant and other sensitive information although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems it is possible that our safety and security measures will not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning or damage or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyberattacks security breaches including physical or electronic breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar breaches can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information while to date we have not experienced a material security breach this risk has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication of such breaches and attempted breaches from around the world have increased any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation divert significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our property taxes could increase due to reassessment or property tax rate changes 

real property taxes on our properties may increase as our properties are reassessed by taxing authorities or as property tax rates change for example a current california law commonly referred to as proposition 13 generally limits annual real estate tax increases on california properties to 2 of assessed value however under proposition 13 property tax reassessment generally occurs as a result of a change in ownership of a property as specially defined for purposes of those rules because the property taxing authorities may not determine whether there has been a change in ownership or the actual reassessed value of a property for a period of time after a transaction has occurred we may not know the impact of a potential reassessment for a considerable amount of time following a particular transaction therefore the amount of property taxes we are required to pay could increase substantially from the property taxes we currently pay or have paid in the past including on a retroactive basis in addition from time to time voters and lawmakers have announced initiatives to repeal or amend proposition 13 to eliminate its application to commercial and industrial property andor introduce split tax roll legislation such initiatives if successful could increase the assessed value andor tax rates applicable to commercial property in california including our stores 

risks related to our organization and structure 

conflicts of interest could arise as a result of our relationship with our operating partnership 

conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates and our operating partnership or any partner thereof our directors and officers have duties to our company under applicable maryland law in connection with their management of our company at the same time we through our whollyowned subsidiary have fiduciary duties as a general partner to our operating partnership and to the limited partners under delaware law in connection with the management of our operating partnership our duties through our whollyowned subsidiary as a general partner to our operating partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our company 

the partnership agreement of our operating partnership does not require us to resolve such conflicts in favor of either our company or the limited partners in our operating partnership unless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement delaware law generally requires a general partner of a delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith fairness and loyalty and which generally prohibit such general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest 

additionally the partnership agreement expressly limits our liability by providing that neither we our direct whollyowned massachusetts business trust subsidiary as the general partner of the operating partnership nor any of our or their trustees directors or officers will be liable or accountable in damages to our operating partnership the limited partners or assignees for errors in judgment mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if we or such trustee director or officer acted in good faith in addition our operating partnership is required to indemnify us our affiliates and each of our respective trustees officers directors employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against any and all losses claims damages liabilities whether joint or several expenses including without limitation attorneys’ fees and other legal fees and expenses judgments fines settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims demands actions suits or proceedings civil criminal administrative or investigative that relate to the operations of the operating partnership provided that our operating partnership will not indemnify for 1 willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law 2 any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement or 3 in the case of a criminal proceeding the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful 

the provisions of delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement 

our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority 

as of december 31 2019  we held interests in 246 operating stores through joint ventures some of these arrangements could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority our reliance on coventurers financial conditions and disputes between us and our coventurers we expect to continue our joint venture strategy by entering into more joint ventures for the purpose of developing new stores and acquiring existing stores in such event we would not be in a position to exercise sole decisionmaking authority regarding the property partnership joint venture or other entity the decisionmaking authority regarding the stores we currently hold through joint ventures is either vested exclusively with our joint venture partners is subject to a majority vote of the joint venture partners or is equally shared by us and the joint venture partners in addition investments in partnerships joint ventures or other entities may under certain circumstances involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or coventurers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions partners or coventurers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions such as a sale because neither we nor the partner or coventurer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or coventurers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers andor directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or coventurers might result in subjecting stores owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our thirdparty partners or coventurers which could harm our financial condition 

certain provisions of maryland law and our organizational documents including the stock ownership limit imposed by our charter may inhibit market activity in our stock and could prevent or delay a change in control transaction 

our charter subject to certain exceptions authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a reit and to limit any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding common stock or 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limit however our board of directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership limit to any proposed transferee whose ownership could jeopardize our qualification as a reit these restrictions on ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the ownership limit may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders different ownership limits apply to the family of kenneth m woolley certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing to spencer f kirk certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and to certain designated investment entities as defined in our charter 

our board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder approval in addition our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares our board of directors could issue additional shares of our common stock or establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise not be in the best interests of our stockholders 

our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited 

maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances in addition our charter eliminates our directors’ and officers’ liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law as a result we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law in addition we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers 

risks related to our debt financings 

disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us 

uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to refinance existing debt maturities on favorable terms or at all which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions and fund development projects a downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell stores or may adversely affect the price we receive for stores that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing 

required payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our stores or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations 

as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 51 billion of outstanding indebtedness we may incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions and development we may borrow under our credit lines or borrow new funds to finance these future stores additionally we do not anticipate that our internally generated cash flow will be adequate to repay our existing indebtedness upon maturity and therefore we expect to repay our indebtedness through refinancings and equity andor debt offerings further we may need to borrow funds in order to make cash distributions to maintain our qualification as a reit or to make our expected distributions to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income each year determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains and we are subject to us federal corporate income tax to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income each year determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and including net capital gains 

if we are required to utilize our credit lines for purposes other than acquisition activity this will reduce the amount available for acquisitions and could slow our growth therefore our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences including the following 



 increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and make cash distributions to our stockholders 

as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 51 billion of debt outstanding of which approximately 11 billion  or 213 was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps this variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 31 per annum increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase our interest expense which could harm our cash flow and our ability to pay cash distributions 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations 

in certain cases we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements hedging involves risks such as the risk that the counterparty may fail to honor its obligations under an arrangement failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders 

uncertainty relating to the libor calculation process and potential phasing out of libor after 2021 may affect our financial results 

in july 2017 the financial conduct authority the authority that regulates libor announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 the alternative reference rates committee “arrc” has proposed that the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to libor for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to libor arrc has proposed a paced market transition plan to sofr from libor and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to libor 

we have outstanding debt and hedge contracts indexed to libor we are monitoring industry transition plans and evaluating the risks related to our debt and hedge contracts indexed to libor i f a published us dollar libor rate is unavailable 

after 2021 the interest rates on these instruments which are indexed to libor will be determined using alternative methods which may result in interest obligations which are more than or do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made on such debt if us dollar libor was available in its current form further the same costs and risks that may lead to the unavailability of us dollar libor may make one or more of the alternative methods impossible or impracticable to determine any of these proposals or consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financing costs and as a result our financial condition operating results and cash flows 

risks related to qualification and operation as a reit 

dividends payable by reits may be taxed at higher rates 

dividends payable by reits may be taxed at higher rates than dividends of nonreit corporations the maximum us federal income tax rate for qualified dividends paid by domestic nonreit corporations to us stockholders that are individuals trust or estates is generally 20 dividends paid by reits to such stockholders are generally not eligible for that rate but under the 2017 tax legislation defined below such stockholders may deduct up to 20 of ordinary dividends ie dividends not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income received from a reit for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by reits such tax rate may still be higher than the tax rate applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends this may cause investors to view reit investments as less attractive than investments in nonreit corporations which in turn may adversely affect the value of stock of reits including our stock in addition the relative 

attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends which could negatively affect the value of our stores 

possible legislative or other actions affecting reits could adversely affect our stockholders 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue service irs and the us department of the treasury changes to the tax laws with or without retroactive application could adversely affect our investors or us in ways we cannot predict new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit the us federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the us federal income tax consequences of an investment in us also the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities or an investment in other entities could change making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit 

the federal tax legislation enacted in december 2017 commonly known as the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 tax legislation” has significantly changed the us federal income taxation of us businesses and their owners including reits and their stockholders the legislation remains unclear in many respects and could still be subject to amendments technical corrections interpretations and implementing regulations by the us department of treasury and the irs any of which could lessen or increase the impact of the legislation 

our failure to qualify as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock 

we believe we operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit or lose our qualification as a reit at any time we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution for each of the years involved because 

  

 in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits this means that our us individual stockholders would be taxed on our dividends at capital gains rates and our us corporate stockholders would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends subject in each case to applicable limitations under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes and are able to avail ourselves of one or more of the relief provisions under the internal revenue code in order to maintain our reit status we may nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of 50000 or more for each such failure as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our securities 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the internal revenue code is greater in the case of a reit that like us holds its assets through a partnership the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the composition of our assets the sources of our gross income and the owners of our stock our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market value of our assets some of which are not susceptible to precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals our ability to satisfy the income tests depends on the sources and amounts of our gross income which we may not be able to control also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains and we will be subject to us federal corporate income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income without regard to the dividends paid deduction and including net capital gains 

we own and may acquire direct or indirect interests in entities that have elected or will elect to be taxed as reits under the internal revenue code each a “subsidiary reit” a subsidiary reit is subject to the various reit qualification requirements and other limitations described herein that are applicable to us if a subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a 

reit then i that subsidiary reit would become subject to us federal income tax ii shares in such subsidiary reit would cease to be qualifying assets for purposes of the asset tests applicable to reits and iii it is possible that we would fail certain of the asset tests applicable to reits in which event we would fail to qualify as a reit unless we could avail ourselves of certain relief provisions 

in addition legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors our ability to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that is intended to allow us to qualify for taxation as a reit we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the irs regarding our qualification as a reit 

we will pay some taxes reducing cash available for stockholders 

even though we qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we will be required to pay some us federal state and local taxes on our income and property extra space management inc manages stores for our joint ventures and stores owned by third parties we jointly with extra space management inc elected to treat extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary “trs” of our company for us federal income tax purposes a trs is subject to us federal corporate income tax on its taxable income esm reinsurance limited a whollyowned subsidiary of extra space management inc generates income from insurance premiums that are subject to us federal income tax and state insurance premiums tax and pays certain insurance royalties to us in addition we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements among our tenants our trs and us are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties also if we sell property as a dealer ie to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on any gain arising from such sales while we do not intend to sell stores as a dealer the irs could take a contrary position to the extent that we are or our trs is required to pay us federal state or local taxes we will have less cash available for distribution to stockholders

 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2019  we owned or had ownership interests in 1171 operating stores of these stores 925 are whollyowned five are in consolidated joint ventures and 241 are in unconsolidated joint ventures in addition we managed 646 stores for third parties bringing the total number of stores which we own andor manage to 1817  these stores are located in 40 states washington dc and puerto rico the majority of our stores are clustered around large population centers the clustering of assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale our acquisitions have given us an increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in many markets where we had no previous presence 

as of december 31 2019  approximately 1015000 tenants were leasing storage units at the operating stores that we own andor manage primarily on a monthtomonth basis providing the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit existing tenants generally receive rate increases at least annually for which no direct correlation has been drawn to our vacancy trends although leases are shortterm in duration the typical tenant tends to remain at our stores for an extended period of time for stores that were stabilized as of december 31 2019  the average length of stay was approximately 158 months 

the average annual rent per square foot for our existing customers at stabilized stores net of discounts and bad debt was 1643 for the year ended december 31 2019  compared to 1592 for the year ended december 31 2018  average annual rent per square foot for new leases was 1812 for the year ended december 31 2019  compared to 1757 for the year ended december 31 2018  the average discounts as a percentage of rental revenues during these periods were 35 and 42  respectively 

our store portfolio is made up of different types of construction and building configurations most often sites are what we consider “hybrid” facilities a mix of both driveup buildings and multifloor buildings we have a number of multifloor buildings with elevator access only and a number of facilities featuring groundfloor access only

overview 

we are a fully integrated selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust “reit” formed to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop selfstorage properties “stores” we derive substantially all of our revenues from our two segments storage operations and tenant reinsurance primary sources of revenue for our storage operations 

segment include rents received from tenants under leases at each of our whollyowned stores our operating results depend materially on our ability to lease available selfstorage units to actively manage unit rental rates and on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments consequently management spends a significant portion of their time maximizing cash flows from our diverse portfolio of stores revenue from our tenant reinsurance segment consists of insurance revenues from the reinsurance of risks relating to the loss of goods stored by tenants in our stores 

our stores are generally situated in highly visible locations clustered around large population centers the clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale to maximize the performance of our stores we employ industryleading revenue management systems developed by our management team these systems enable us to analyze set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions we believe our systems and processes allow us to more proactively manage revenues 

we operate in competitive markets often where consumers have multiple stores from which to choose competition has impacted and will continue to impact our store results we experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity we believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the combination of our revenue management team and our industryleading technology systems we consider a store to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization we consider a store to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 of the current year or has been open for three years prior to january 1 of the current year 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those that impact our most critical accounting policies we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances a summary of significant accounting policies is also provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements actual results may differ from these estimates we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies and estimates 

consolidation arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as variable interest entities “vies” an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it is the primary beneficiary of the vie 

under certain circumstances when we enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures a vie may be created the primary factors that require the most judgment in determining whether the joint venture is a vie are whether the decisions that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance were controlled by the equity holders as a group and whether the joint venture has sufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated support 

if the joint venture is determined to be a vie we perform a qualitative analysis including considering which party if any has the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of each vie and whether that party has the obligation to absorb losses of the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could be significant to the vie if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie the assets liabilities and operations of the vie are consolidated within our financial statements otherwise our investment is generally accounted for under the equity method our ability to correctly assess the influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of the investment in our consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2019  we had no consolidated vies as of december 31 2018  our operating partnership had notes payable to one trust that was considered a vie since the operating partnership was not the primary beneficiary of the trust this vie was not consolidated 

real estate assets we account for the acquisition of stores including by merger and other acquisitions of real estate in accordance with asc 80510  business combinations we use our judgment to determine if assets acquired meet the definition of a business or if the acquisition should be considered an asset acquisition subsequent to our january 1 2017 adoption of asu 201701 business combinations topic 805  clarifying the definition of a business we must make significant assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired and consideration transferred these assumptions and estimates require judgment and therefore others could come to 

materially different conclusions as to the estimated fair values which could result in differences in depreciation and amortization expense gains and losses on the sale of real estate assets and real estate and intangible asset values 

evaluation of asset impairment long lived assets held for use are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment we review each store at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist we focus on stores where occupancy andor rental income have decreased by a significant amount for these stores we determine whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the store will likely recover the lost occupancy andor revenue in the short term in addition we review stores in the leaseup stage and compare actual operating results to original projections we may not have identified all material facts and circumstances that affect impairment of our stores no material impairments were recorded in the year ended december 31 2019  

derivative instruments and hedging activities we hold a number of derivative instruments which we use to hedge our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows mainly related to our interest rates on variable interest debt we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes we assess our derivatives both at inception and on an ongoing quarterly basis for whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are effective the rules and interpretations relating to the accounting for derivatives are complex failure to apply this guidance correctly may require us to recognize all changes in fair value of the hedged derivative in earnings which may materially impact our results 

income taxes we have elected to be treated as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code in order to maintain our qualification as a reit among other things we are required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets as a reit we are not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to our stockholders we plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex for any taxable year that we fail to qualify as a reit and for which applicable statutory relief provisions did not apply we would be subject to federal corporate income tax on all of our taxable income for at least that year and the ensuing four years we could also be subject to penalties and interest and our net income may be materially different from the amounts reported in our financial statements 

we have elected to treat one of our corporate subsidiaries extra space management inc as a trs in general our trs may perform additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or nonreal estate related business a trs is subject to federal corporate income tax interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense when incurred if tax authorities determine that amounts paid by our trs to us are not reasonable compared to similar arrangements among unrelated parties we could be subject to a penalty tax on the excess payments

income tax expense— for the year ended december 31 2019  the increase in income tax expense was the result of an increase in income earned by our taxable reit subsidiary when compared to the same period in the prior year and a decrease in solar tax credits when compared to the year ended december 31 2018 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2018 to the year ended december 31 2017 

the results of operations for the years ended december 31 2018 compared to december 31 2017 was included in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2018 on page 18 under part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which was filed with the sec on february 26 2019 

funds from operations 

funds from operations ffo provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary along with net income and cash flows for an understanding of our operating results we believe ffo is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings net earnings assume that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses the values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and we believe ffo more accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts inc “nareit” as net income computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” excluding gains or losses on sales of operating stores and impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate assets plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis we believe that to further understand our performance ffo should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with gaap as presented in the consolidated financial statements ffo should not be considered a replacement of net income computed in accordance with gaap 

the computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions 

the following table presents the calculation of ffo for the periods indicated

our samestore pool for the periods presented consists of 821 stores that are whollyowned and operated and that were stabilized by the first day of the earliest calendar year presented we consider a store to be stabilized once it has been open for three years or has sustained average square foot occupancy of 80 or more for one calendar year we believe that by providing samestore results from a stabilized pool of stores with accompanying operating metrics including but not limited to occupancy rental revenue growth operating expense growth net operating income growth etc stockholders and potential investors are able to evaluate operating performance without the effects of nonstabilized occupancy levels rent levels expense levels acquisitions or completed developments samestore results should not be used as a basis for future samestore performance or for the performance of our stores as a whole the following table presents operating data for our samestore portfolio 



samestore revenues for the year ended december 31 2019 increased due to higher rental rates for both new and existing customers expenses were higher for the year ended december 31 2019  primarily due to increases in marketing expenses and property taxes 

the following table presents a reconciliation of samestore net operating income to net income as presented on our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated 



comparison of the year ended december 31 2018 to the year ended december 31 2017 

the same store results for the years ended december 31 2018 compared to december 31 2017 was included in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2018 on page 25 under part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which was filed with the sec on february 26 2019 

cash flows 

cash flows from operating activities increased as expected from our continued growth in revenues through rates along with the increase in the number of properties we own and operate cash flows used in investing activities relate primarily to our acquisition development sales of stores investments in unconsolidated real estate entities and bridge loans and fluctuate depending on our actions in those areas cash flows from financing activities depend primarily on our debt and equity financing activities a summary of cash flows along with significant components are as follows 



we believe that cash flows generated by operations along with our existing cash and cash equivalents the availability of funds under our existing lines of credit and our access to capital markets will be sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during the next twelve months these cash needs include operating expenses monthly debt service payments recurring capital expenditures acquisitions building redevelopments and expansions distributions to unit holders and dividends to stockholders necessary to maintain our reit qualification 

we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2020 and we consider these projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash these cash flows are principally derived from rents paid by our tenants a significant deterioration in projected cash flows from operations could cause us to increase our reliance on available funds under our existing lines of credit curtail planned capital expenditures or seek other additional sources of financing 

liquidity and capital resources 

financing strategy 

we will continue to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts reviewed from time to time by our board of directors although our board of directors has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur we will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or variable rate in making financing decisions we will consider factors including but not limited to 

  

 our indebtedness may be recourse nonrecourse crosscollateralized crossdefaulted secured or unsecured in addition we may invest in stores subject to existing loans collateralized by mortgages or similar liens or may refinance stores acquired on a leveraged basis we may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness to refinance investments including the redevelopment of existing stores for general working capital or to purchase additional interests in partnerships or joint ventures or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable 

as of december 31 2019  we had 65746 available in cash and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts during 2019 and 2018  we experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash or cash equivalents however there can be no assurance that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 

as of december 31 2019  we had 5076501 face value of debt resulting in a debt to total enterprise value ratio of 259  as of december 31 2018  we had 4854077 face value of debt resulting in a debt total enterprise value ratio of 284 as of december 31 2019  the ratio of total fixedrate debt and other instruments to total debt was 787 including 2290356 on which we have interest rate swaps that have been included as fixedrate debt as of december 31 2018  the ratio of total fixedrate debt and other instruments to total debt was 741 including 2192550 on which we have interest rate swaps that have been included as fixedrate debt the weighted average interest rate of the total of fixed and variablerate debt at december 31 2019 and 2018 was 33 and 35 respectively 

in july 2019 we obtained a bbbstable rating from sp and intend to manage our balance sheet to preserve such rating certain of our real estate assets are pledged as collateral for our debt we are subject to certain restrictive covenants relating to our outstanding debt we were in compliance with all financial covenants at december 31 2019  

we expect to fund our shortterm liquidity requirements including operating expenses recurring capital expenditures dividends to stockholders distributions to holders of operating partnership units and interest on our outstanding indebtedness out of our operating cash flow cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving lines of credit in addition we are pursuing additional sources of financing based on anticipated funding needs 

our liquidity needs consist primarily of operating expenses monthly debt service payments recurring capital expenditures dividends to stockholders and distributions to unit holders necessary to maintain our reit qualification we may from time to time seek to repurchase our outstanding debt shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors in addition we evaluate on an ongoing basis the merits of strategic acquisitions and other relationships which may require us to raise additional funds we may also use operating partnership units as currency to fund acquisitions from selfstorage owners who desire taxdeferral in their exiting transactions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes further except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitments or intent to provide funding to any such entities accordingly we are not materially exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 

contractual obligations 

the following table presents information on future payments due by period as of december 31 2019  



the operating leases above include undiscounted lease payments on leases for 48 of our operating stores as well as leases of our corporate offices and division offices three ground leases include additional contingent rental payments based on the level of revenue achieved at the store 

as of december 31 2019  the weighted average interest rate for all fixed rate loans was 34  and the weighted average interest rate on all variable rate loans was 31  

for more information on our contractual obligations related to real estate acquisitions refer to our commitments and contingencies footnote in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

seasonality 

the selfstorage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations a greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from may through september historically our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of july while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early march results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our future income cash flows and fair values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary and tax policies domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 51 billion in total face value debt of which approximately 11 billion was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 108 million annually 

interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur further in the event of a change of that magnitude we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure 

derivative instruments 

we use derivative instruments to help manage interest rate risk using designated hedge relationships interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixedrate and variablerate interest payments between two parties based on a contractual underlying notional amount but do not involve the exchange of the underlying notional amounts see our derivatives footnote in our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information about our use of derivative contracts

management 

members of our executive management team have significant experience in all aspects of the selfstorage industry our executive management team and their years of industry experience are as follows joseph d margolis chief executive officer 14 years scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer 18 years samrat sondhi executive vice president and chief operating officer 15 years gwyn mcneal executive vice president and chief legal officer 13 years james overturf executive vice president and chief marketing officer 20 years 

our executive management team and board of directors have an ownership position in the company with executive officers and directors owning approximately 4120722  shares or 32  of our outstanding common stock as of february 19 2019  

industry  competition 

stores offer monthtomonth rental of storage space for personal or business use tenants typically rent fully enclosed spaces that vary in size and typically range from 5 feet by 5 feet to 20 feet by 20 feet with an interior height of 8 feet to 12 feet tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units stores generally have onsite managers who supervise and run the daytoday operations providing tenants with assistance as needed 

selfstorage provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions due to life changes or simply because of a need for storage space the mix of residential tenants using a store is determined by a store’s local demographics and often includes people who are experiencing life changes such as downsizing their living space or others who are not yet settled into a permanent residence items that tenants place in selfstorage are typically furniture household items 

and appliances commercial tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods records inventory or storage for seasonal goods 

our research has shown that tenants choose a store based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or business making highdensity hightraffic population centers ideal locations for stores a store’s price perceived security cleanliness and the general professionalism of the store managers and staff are also contributing factors to a store’s ability to successfully secure rentals although most stores are leased to tenants on a monthtomonth basis tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time 

the selfstorage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations a greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from may through september historically our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of july while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early march 

since inception in the early 1970’s the selfstorage industry has experienced significant growth the selfstorage industry has also seen increases in occupancy over the past several years according to the selfstorage almanac the “almanac” in 2013 the national average physical occupancy rate was 878  of net rentable square feet compared to an average physical occupancy rate of 917  in 2018 

the industry is also characterized by fragmented ownership according to the almanac as of the end of 2018  the top ten selfstorage companies in the united states operated approximately 152  of the total us stores and the top 50 selfstorage companies operated approximately 184  of the total us stores we believe this fragmentation will contribute to continued consolidation at some level in the future 

we believe that we are well positioned to compete for acquisitions recently we have encountered competition when we have sought to acquire existing operating stores especially for brokered portfolios competitive bidding practices have been commonplace between both public and private entities and this will likely continue 

we are the second largest selfstorage operator in the united states we are one of five public selfstorage reits along with cubesmart life storage national storage affiliates and public storage 

longterm growth and investment strategies 

our primary business objectives are to maximize cash flow available for distribution to our stockholders and to achieve sustainable longterm growth in cash flow per share in order to maximize longterm stockholder value both at acceptable levels of risk we continue to evaluate a range of growth initiatives and opportunities our primary strategies include the following 

maximize the performance of our stores through strategic efficient and proactive management   

we pursue revenuegenerating and expenseminimizing opportunities in our operations our revenue management team seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our advanced technology systems ability to provide realtime interactive rental rate and discount management our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement more effective online marketing programs which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost 

we continually analyze our portfolio to look for longterm valueenhancing opportunities we proactively redevelop properties to add units or modify existing unit mix to better meet the demand in a given market and to maximize revenue we also redevelop properties to reduce their effective useful age increase visual appeal enhance security and to improve brand consistency across the portfolio 

acquire selfstorage stores   

our acquisitions team continues to pursue the acquisition of multistore portfolios and single stores that we believe can provide stockholder value we have established a reputation as a reliable ethical buyer which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions in addition we believe our status as an upreit enables flexibility when structuring deals we remain a disciplined buyer and only execute acquisitions that we believe will strengthen our portfolio and increase stockholder value 

in addition to the pursuit of stabilized stores we develop stores from the ground up and provide the construction capital we also purchase stores at the completion of construction from third party developers who build to our specifications these stores purchased at completion of construction a certificate of occupancy store create additional long term value for our stockholders we are typically able to acquire these assets at a lower price than a stabilized store and expect greater long term 

returns on these stores on average however in the short term these acquisitions cause dilution to our earnings during the twotofour year period required to lease up the certificate of occupancy stores we expect that this trend will continue in 2019 as we continue to acquire certificate of occupancy stores 

expand our management business 

our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees as well as expand our geographic footprint data sophistication and scale with little capital investment we believe this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale in addition we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline we pursue strategic relationships with owners whose stores would enhance our portfolio in the event an opportunity arises to acquire such stores 

financing of our longterm growth strategies 

acquisition and development financing 

as a reit we are required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income to our stockholders consequently we require access to additional sources of capital to fund our growth we expect to maintain a flexible approach to financing growth we plan to finance future acquisitions through a diverse capital optimization strategy which includes but is not limited to cash generated from operations borrowings under our revolving lines of credit the credit lines secured and unsecured financing equity offerings joint ventures and the sale of stores 

credit lines  we have two credit lines which we primarily use as short term bridge financing until we obtain longerterm financing through either debt or equity as of december 31 2018  our credit lines had available capacity of 7900 million  of which 7090 million  was undrawn 

secured and unsecured debt   historically we had primarily used traditional secured mortgage loans to finance store acquisitions and development efforts more recently we obtain unsecured bank term loans and issue unsecured private placement bonds we will continue to utilize a combination of secured and unsecured financing for future store acquisitions and development as of december 31 2018  we had 29 billion  of secured notes payable and 19  billion of unsecured notes payable outstanding compared to 28 billion  of secured notes payable and 17  billion of unsecured notes payable outstanding as of december 31 2017  

equity  we have an active at the market atm program for selling stock we sell stock under the atm program from time to time to raise capital when we believe conditions are advantageous during the year ended december 31 2018  we issued 933789  shares of common stock through our atm program and received net proceeds of approximately 905  million no shares were issued under the atm program during the year ended december 31 2017  

we view equity interests in our operating partnership as another source of capital that can provide an attractive tax planning opportunity to sellers of real estate we issue common and preferred operating partnership units to sellers in certain acquisitions common operating partnership units receive distributions equal to the dividends on common stock while preferred operating partnership units receive distributions at various negotiated rates we may issue additional units in the future when circumstances are favorable 

joint venture financing  as of december 31 2018  we owned 233  of our stores through joint ventures with third parties our joint venture partners typically provide most of the equity capital required for the acquisition of stores owned in these joint ventures most joint venture agreements include buysell rights as well as rights of first offer in connection with the sale of stores by the joint venture we generally manage the daytoday operations of the stores owned in these joint ventures and have the right to participate in major decisions relating to sales of stores or financings by the applicable joint venture but do not control the joint ventures 

sale of properties  we have not historically sold a high volume of stores as we generally believe we are able to optimize the cash flow from stores through continued operations however we may sell more stores or interests in stores in the future in response to changing economic financial or investment conditions for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  we sold one store to a third party for approximately 402  million and 36 stores to a new joint venture with an existing partner for 2950 million  respectively 

regulation 

generally stores are subject to various laws ordinances and regulations including regulations relating to lien sale rights and procedures and the americans with disabilities act of 1990 changes in any of these laws or regulations as well as changes in laws such as the comprehensive environmental response and compensation liability act which increase the potential liability for environmental conditions or circumstances existing or created by tenants or others on stores or laws affecting development construction operation upkeep safety and taxation may result in significant unanticipated expenditures loss of stores or other impairments to operations which would adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition noncompliance with any of these laws ordinances or regulations could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could require substantial capital expenditures to ensure compliance 

insurance activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state in accordance with the mccarranferguson act and are subject to the grammleachbliley act and the privacy regulations promulgated by the federal trade commission pursuant thereto store management activities may be subject to state real estate brokerage laws and regulations as determined by the particular real estate commission for each state changes in any of the laws governing our conduct could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business or could materially affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

employees 

as of december 31 2018  we had 3624  employees and believe our relationship with our employees is good our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement 




 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our securities involves various risks all investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information contained in this annual report before trading in our securities if any of the events set forth in the following risks actually occur our business operating results prospects and financial condition could be harmed 

our performance is subject to risks associated with real estate investments we are a real estate company that derives our income from the operation of our stores there are a number of factors that may adversely affect the income that our stores generate including the following 

risks related to our stores and operations 

adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating results 

our revenues and net operating income can be negatively impacted by general economic factors that lead to a reduction in demand for rental space in the markets in which we operate 

if we are unable to promptly relet our units or if the rates upon such reletting are significantly lower than expected our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

virtually all of our leases are on a monthtomonth basis any delay in reletting units as vacancies arise would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results in addition lower than expected rental rates upon reletting could adversely affect our revenues and impede our growth 

uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flow 

we maintain comprehensive property and casualty insurance policies including liability fire flood earthquake wind as we deem necessary or as required by our lenders umbrella coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our stores certain types of losses however may be either uninsurable not economically insurable or coverage may be excluded on certain policies such as losses due to earthquakes hurricanes tornadoes riots acts of war terrorism or social engineering should an uninsured loss occur we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a store in addition if any such loss is insured we may be required to pay significant amounts on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to our insurer being obligated to reimburse us for the loss or the amount of the loss may exceed our coverage for the loss as a result our operating results may be adversely affected 

legal disputes settlement and defense costs could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

from time to time we have to make monetary settlements or defend actions or arbitration including class actions to resolve tenant employmentrelated or other claims and disputes settling any such liabilities could negatively impact our operating results and cash available for distribution to stockholders and could also adversely affect our ability to sell lease operate or encumber affected properties 

our tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation which may adversely affect our results 

our tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation the regulatory authorities generally have broad discretion to grant renew and revoke licenses and approvals to promulgate interpret and implement regulations and to evaluate compliance with regulations through periodic examinations audits and investigations of the affairs of insurance providers as a result of regulatory or private action in any jurisdiction we may be temporarily or permanently suspended from continuing some or all of our reinsurance activities or otherwise fined or penalized or suffer an adverse judgment which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our stores may adversely affect our results of operations 

under various us federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances which could be substantial such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release or presence of such hazardous substances from time to time we may acquire properties or interests in properties with known adverse environmental conditions for which we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior riskadjusted return 

costs associated with complying with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 may result in unanticipated expenses 

under the ada places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons a number of additional us federal state and local laws may also require modifications to our stores or restrict certain further renovations of the stores with respect to access thereto by disabled persons if one or more of our stores is not in compliance with the ada or other legislation then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the facility into compliance 

there is significant competition among selfstorage operators and from other storage alternatives 

competition in the local markets in which many of our stores are located is significant and has affected our occupancy levels rental rates and operating expenses development of selfstorage facilities has increased in recent years which has intensified competition and we expect it will continue to do so as newly developed facilities are opened development of selfstorage facilities by other operators could continue to increase in the future actions by our competitors may decrease or prevent increases in our occupancy and rental rates while increasing our operating expenses which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria which may impede our growth 

our ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy we may not be successful in identifying suitable stores or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms or at all failure to identify or consummate acquisitions will slow our growth which could in turn adversely affect our stock price 

our ability to acquire stores on favorable terms and successfully integrate and operate them may be constrained by the following significant risks 



 we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes including financial transactions and records personally identifiable information and tenant and lease data we purchase some of our information technology from vendors on whom our systems depend we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential tenant and other sensitive information although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems it is possible that our safety and security measures will not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning or damage or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyberattacks security breaches including physical or electronic breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar breaches can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information while to date we have not experienced a material security breach this risk has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication of such breaches and attempted breaches from around the world have increased any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation divert significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

risks related to our organization and structure 

conflicts of interest could arise as a result of our relationship with our operating partnership 

conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates and our operating partnership or any partner thereof our directors and officers have duties to our company under applicable maryland law in connection with their management of our company at the same time we through our whollyowned subsidiary have fiduciary duties as a general partner to our operating partnership and to the limited partners under delaware law in connection with the management of our operating partnership our duties through our whollyowned subsidiary as a general partner to our operating partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our company the partnership agreement of our operating partnership does not require us to resolve such conflicts in favor of either our company or the limited partners in our operating partnership unless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement delaware law generally requires a general partner of a delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith fairness and loyalty and which generally prohibit such general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest 

additionally the partnership agreement expressly limits our liability by providing that neither we our direct whollyowned massachusetts business trust subsidiary as the general partner of the operating partnership nor any of our or their trustees directors or officers will be liable or accountable in damages to our operating partnership the limited partners or assignees for errors in judgment mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if we or such trustee director or officer acted in good faith in addition our operating partnership is required to indemnify us our affiliates and each of our respective trustees officers directors employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against any and all losses claims damages liabilities whether joint or several expenses including without limitation attorneys’ fees and other legal fees and expenses judgments fines settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims demands actions suits or proceedings civil criminal administrative or investigative that relate to the operations of the operating partnership provided that our operating partnership will not indemnify for 1 willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law 2 any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement or 3 in the case of a criminal proceeding the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful 

the provisions of delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement 

our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority 

as of december 31 2018  we held interests in 233  operating stores through joint ventures some of these arrangements could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority our reliance on coventurers financial conditions and disputes between us and our coventurers we expect to continue our joint venture strategy by entering into more joint ventures for the purpose of developing new stores and acquiring existing stores in such event we would not be in a position to exercise sole decisionmaking authority regarding the property partnership joint venture or other entity the decisionmaking authority regarding the stores we currently hold through joint ventures is either vested exclusively with our joint venture partners is subject to a majority vote of the joint venture partners or is equally shared by us and the joint venture partners in addition investments in partnerships joint ventures or other entities may under certain circumstances involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or coventurers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions partners or coventurers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions such as a sale because neither we nor the partner or coventurer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or coventurers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers andor directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or coventurers might result in subjecting stores owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our thirdparty partners or coventurers which could harm our financial condition 

certain provisions of maryland law and our organizational documents including the stock ownership limit imposed by our charter may inhibit market activity in our stock and could prevent or delay a change in control transaction 

our charter subject to certain exceptions authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a reit and to limit any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding common stock or 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limit however our board of directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership limit to any proposed transferee whose ownership could jeopardize our qualification as a reit these restrictions on ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the ownership limit may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders different ownership limits apply to the family of kenneth m woolley certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing to spencer f kirk certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and to certain designated investment entities as defined in our charter 

our board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder approval in addition our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares our board of directors could issue additional shares of our common stock or establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise not be in the best interests of our stockholders 

our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited 

maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances in addition our charter eliminates our directors’ and officers’ liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law as a result we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law in addition we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers 

risks related to our debt financings 

disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us 

uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to refinance existing debt maturities on favorable terms or at all which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions and fund development projects a downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell stores or may adversely affect the price we receive for stores that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing 

required payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our stores or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 49 billion  of outstanding indebtedness we may incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions and development we may borrow under our credit lines or borrow new funds to finance these future stores additionally we do not anticipate that our internally generated cash flow will be adequate to repay our existing indebtedness upon maturity and therefore we expect to repay our indebtedness through refinancings and equity andor debt offerings further we may need to borrow funds in order to make cash distributions to maintain our qualification as a reit or to make our expected distributions to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our net taxable income each year excluding net capital gains and we are subject to us federal corporate income tax to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income each year 

if we are required to utilize our credit lines for purposes other than acquisition activity this will reduce the amount available for acquisitions and could slow our growth therefore our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences including the following 

 increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and make cash distributions to our stockholders 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 49 billion  of debt outstanding of which approximately 13 billion  or 259 was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps this variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 39  per annum increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase our interest expense which could harm our cash flow and our ability to pay cash distributions 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations 

in certain cases we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements hedging involves risks such as the risk that the counterparty may fail to honor its obligations under an arrangement failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders 

risks related to qualification and operation as a reit 

dividends payable by reits may be taxed at higher rates 

dividends payable by reits may be taxed at higher rates than dividends of nonreit corporations the maximum us federal income tax rate for qualified dividends paid by domestic nonreit corporations to us stockholders that are individuals trust or estates is generally 20 dividends paid by reits to such stockholders are generally not eligible for that rate but under the 2017 tax legislation defined below such stockholders may deduct up to 20 of ordinary dividends ie dividends not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income from a reit for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by reits such tax rate may still be higher than the tax rate applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends this may cause investors to view reit investments as less attractive than investments in nonreit corporations which in turn may adversely affect the value of stock of reits including our stock in addition the relative attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends which could negatively affect the value of our stores 

possible legislative or other actions affecting reits could adversely affect our stockholders 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue service irs and the us department of the treasury changes to the tax laws with or without retroactive application could adversely affect our investors or us in ways we cannot predict new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit the us federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the us federal income tax consequences of an investment in us also the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities or an investment in other entities could change making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit 

the federal tax legislation enacted in december 2017 commonly known as the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 tax legislation” has significantly changed the us federal income taxation of us businesses and their owners including reits and their stockholders changes made by the 2017 tax legislation that could affect us and our stockholders include 

 

many of these changes that are applicable to us are effective beginning with our 2018 taxable year without any transition periods or grandfathering for existing transactions the legislation was unclear in many respects and could still be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the treasury and irs any of which could lessen or increase the impact of the legislation in addition it is still unclear how these us federal income tax changes could affect state and local taxation which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities while some of the changes made by the tax legislation may adversely affect us in one 

or more reporting periods and prospectively other changes may be beneficial in the future we continue to work with our tax advisors to determine the full impact that the 2017 tax legislation as a whole will have on us 

our failure to qualify as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock 

we believe we operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit or lose our qualification as a reit at any time we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution for each of the years involved because 

  

 in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits this means that our us individual stockholders would be taxed on our dividends at capital gains rates and our us corporate stockholders would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends subject in each case to applicable limitations under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes and are able to avail ourselves of one or more of the relief provisions under the internal revenue code in order to maintain our reit status we may nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of 50000 or more for each such failure as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our securities 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the internal revenue code is greater in the case of a reit that like us holds its assets through a partnership the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the composition of our assets the sources of our gross income and the owners of our stock our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market value of our assets some of which are not susceptible to precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals our ability to satisfy the income tests depends on the sources and amounts of our gross income which we may not be able to control also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our net taxable income excluding capital gains and we will be subject to us federal corporate income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income including capital gains in addition legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors our ability to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that is intended to allow us to qualify for taxation as a reit we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the irs regarding our qualification as a reit 

we will pay some taxes reducing cash available for stockholders 

even though we qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we will be required to pay some us federal state and local taxes on our income and property extra space management inc manages stores for our joint ventures and stores owned by third parties we jointly with extra space management inc elected to treat extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary “trs” of our company for us federal income tax purposes a trs is subject to us federal corporate income tax on its taxable income esm reinsurance limited a whollyowned subsidiary of extra space management inc generates income from insurance premiums that are subject to us federal income tax and state insurance premiums tax and pays certain insurance royalties to us in addition we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements among our tenants our trs and us are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties also if we sell property as a dealer ie to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on any gain arising from such sales while we do not intend to sell stores as a dealer the irs could take a contrary position to the extent that we are or our trs is required to pay us federal state or local taxes we will have less cash available for distribution to stockholders

 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2018  we owned or had ownership interests in 1111  operating stores of these stores 878  are whollyowned four  are in consolidated joint ventures and 229  are in unconsolidated joint ventures in addition we managed an additional 536  stores for third parties bringing the total number of stores which we own andor manage to 1647  these stores are located in 39  states washington dc and puerto rico the majority of our stores are clustered around large population centers the clustering of assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale our acquisitions have given us an increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in many markets where we had no previous presence 

as of december 31 2018  approximately 910000  tenants were leasing storage units at the operating stores that we own andor manage primarily on a monthtomonth basis providing the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit existing tenants generally receive rate increases at least annually for which no direct correlation has been drawn to our vacancy trends although leases are shortterm in duration the typical tenant tends to remain at our stores for an extended period of time for stores that were stabilized as of december 31 2018  the average length of stay was approximately 151  months 

the average annual rent per square foot for our existing customers at stabilized stores net of discounts and bad debt was 1616  for the year ended december 31 2018  compared to 1558  for the year ended december 31 2017  average annual rent per square foot for new leases was 1765  for the year ended december 31 2018  compared to 1658  for the year ended december 31 2017  the average discounts as a percentage of rental revenues during these periods were 41  and 40  respectively 

our store portfolio is made up of different types of construction and building configurations most often sites are what we consider “hybrid” facilities a mix of both driveup buildings and multifloor buildings we have a number of multifloor buildings with elevator access only and a number of facilities featuring groundfloor access only

overview 

we are a fully integrated selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust “reit” formed to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop selfstorage properties “stores” we derive substantially all of our revenues from our two segments storage operations and tenant reinsurance primary sources of revenue for our storage operations segment include rents received from tenants under leases at each of our whollyowned stores our operating results depend materially on our ability to lease available selfstorage units to actively manage unit rental rates and on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments consequently management spends a significant portion of their time maximizing 

cash flows from our diverse portfolio of stores revenue from our tenant reinsurance segment consists of insurance revenues from the reinsurance of risks relating to the loss of goods stored by tenants in our stores 

our stores are generally situated in highly visible locations clustered around large population centers these areas enjoy above average population growth and income levels the clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale to maximize the performance of our stores we employ industryleading revenue management systems developed by our management team these systems enable us to analyze set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions we believe our systems and processes allow us to more proactively manage revenues 

we operate in competitive markets often where consumers have multiple stores from which to choose competition has impacted and will continue to impact our store results we experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity we believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the combination of our revenue management team and our industryleading technology systems we consider a store to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization we consider a store to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 of the current year or has been open for three years prior to january 1 of the current year 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those that impact our most critical accounting policies we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances a summary of significant accounting policies is also provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements actual results may differ from these estimates we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies and estimates 

consolidation  arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as variable interest entities “vies” an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it is the primary beneficiary of the vie 

we have concluded that under certain circumstances when we enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures a vie may be created for each vie created we have performed a qualitative analysis including considering which party if any has the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of each vie and whether that party has the obligation to absorb losses of the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could be significant to the vie if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie the assets liabilities and operations of the vie are consolidated with our financial statements otherwise our investment is generally accounted for under the equity method our ability to correctly assess the influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of the investment in our consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2018  we had no consolidated vies additionally our operating partnership has notes payable to one trust that is considered a vie since the operating partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the trust this vie is not consolidated 

real estate assets   we account for the acquisition of stores including by merger and other acquisitions of real estate in accordance with asc 80510  business combinations   we use our judgment to determine if assets acquired meet the definition of a business or if the acquisition should be considered an asset acquisition subsequent to our january 1 2017 adoption of asu 201701 business combinations topic 805  clarifying the definition of a business   we must make significant assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired and consideration transferred these assumptions and estimates require judgment and therefore others could come to materially different conclusions as to the estimated fair values which could result in differences in depreciation and amortization expense gains and losses on the sale of real estate assets and real estate and intangible asset values 

evaluation of asset impairment  long lived assets held for use are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment we review each store at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist we focus on stores where occupancy andor rental income have decreased by a significant amount for these stores we determine whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the store will 

likely recover the lost occupancy andor revenue in the short term in addition we review stores in the leaseup stage and compare actual operating results to original projections we may not have identified all material facts and circumstances that affect impairment of our stores no material impairments were recorded in the year ended december 31 2018  

derivative instruments and hedging activities  we hold a number of derivative instruments which we use to hedge our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows mainly related to our interest rates on variable interest debt we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes we assess our derivatives both at inception and on an ongoing quarterly basis for whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are effective the rules and interpretations relating to the accounting for derivatives are complex failure to apply this guidance correctly may require us to recognize all changes in fair value of the hedged derivative in earnings which may materially impact our results 

income taxes  we have elected to be treated as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code in order to maintain our qualification as a reit among other things we are required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets as a reit we are not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to our stockholders we plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex for any taxable year that we fail to qualify as a reit and for which applicable statutory relief provisions did not apply we would be subject to federal corporate income tax on all of our taxable income for at least that year and the ensuing four years we could also be subject to penalties and interest and our net income may be materially different from the amounts reported in our financial statements 

we have elected to treat one of our corporate subsidiaries extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary “trs” in general our trs may perform additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or nonreal estate related business a trs is subject to federal corporate income tax interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense when incurred if tax authorities determine that amounts paid by our trs to us are not reasonable compared to similar arrangements among unrelated parties we could be subject to a penalty tax on the excess payments

revenues 

the following table presents information on revenues earned for the years indicated 



property rental— the increase in property rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2018  was primarily the result of an increase of 57827  associated with acquisitions completed in 2018  and 2017  we acquired 34  stores and opened three new development stores during the year ended december 31 2018  and acquired 46  stores during the year ended december 31 2017  property rental revenue also increased by 36797  during the year ended december 31 2018  as a result of increases in rental rates to new and existing customers at our stabilized stores these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 26313  from the sale of 36 stores during the year ended december 31 2017 to a new joint venture with an existing partner we have a 10 ownership interest in the new joint venture we sold one additional store during the year ended december 31 2018  

tenant reinsurance —the increase in tenant reinsurance revenues was due primarily to an increase in stores operated as well as an increase in the average tenant insured value per policy we operated 1647  stores at december 31 2018  compared to 1483  stores at december 31 2017  

management fees and other income —management fees represent the fee collected for our management of stores owned by third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures

equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures—gain on sale of real estate assets and purchase of joint venture partners’ interests—  beginning january 1 2017 the acquisition of our joint venture partners interests in stores are no longer considered business combinations achieved in stages step acquisitions due to the adoption of asu 201701 business combinations topic 805 clarifying the definition of a business  instead these transactions are considered asset acquisitions therefore we had no gain or loss to record related to these transactions during the year ended december 31 2017 in 2016 we had several large transactions with our joint venture partners that did result in gains we acquired 11 stores from 

the ess wcot llc joint venture wcot in a step acquisition we recorded a gain of 4651  as a result of the transaction similarly we acquired 23  stores from our prisa ii joint venture prisa ii in a separate step acquisition and recorded a gain of 6778  on the transaction immediately after the step acquisition we sold our interest in the prisa ii joint venture which still owned 42  properties to our joint venture partners and recognized a gain of 30846 lastly we acquired six stores from our vrs self storage llc joint venture “vrs” in a step acquisition where we again recorded a gain of 26923

funds from operations 

funds from operations ffo provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary along with net income and cash flows for an understanding of our operating results we believe ffo is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings net earnings assume that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses the values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and we believe ffo more accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts inc “nareit” as net income computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” excluding gains or losses on sales of operating stores and impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate assets plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis we believe that to further understand our performance ffo should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with gaap as presented in the consolidated financial statements ffo should not be considered a replacement of net income computed in accordance with gaap 

the computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions 

the following table presents the calculation of ffo for the periods indicated

our samestore pool for the periods presented consists of 783  stores that are whollyowned and operated and that were stabilized by the first day of the earliest calendar year presented we consider a store to be stabilized once it has been open for three years or has sustained average square foot occupancy of 80 or more for one calendar year we believe that by providing samestore results from a stabilized pool of stores with accompanying operating metrics including but not limited to occupancy rental revenue growth operating expense growth net operating income growth etc stockholders and potential investors are able to evaluate operating performance without the effects of nonstabilized occupancy levels rent levels expense levels acquisitions or completed developments samestore results should not be used as a basis for future samestore performance or for the performance of our stores as a whole the following table presents operating data for our samestore portfolio 



samestore revenues for the year ended ended december 31 2018  increased due to gains in occupancy and higher rental rates for both new and existing customers expenses were higher for the year ended december 31 2018  primarily due to increases in property taxes payroll and benefits and marketing

cash flows 

cash flows from operating activities increased as expected from our continued growth in revenues through rates along with the increase in the number of properties we own and operate cash flows used in investing activities relate primarily to our acquisition development and sales of stores and investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures and fluctuate depending on our actions in those areas cash flows from financing activities depend primarily on our debt and equity financing activities a summary of cash flows along with significant components are as follows 



we believe that cash flows generated by operations along with our existing cash and cash equivalents the availability of funds under our existing lines of credit and our access to capital markets will be sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during the next twelve months these cash needs include operating expenses monthly debt service payments recurring capital expenditures acquisitions building redevelopments and expansions distributions to unit holders and dividends to stockholders necessary to maintain our reit qualification 

we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2019 and we consider these projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash these cash flows are principally derived from rents paid by our tenants a significant deterioration in projected cash flows from operations could cause us to increase our reliance on available funds under our existing lines of credit curtail planned capital expenditures or seek other additional sources of financing 

liquidity and capital resources 

financing strategy 

we will continue to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts reviewed from time to time by our board of directors although our board of directors has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur we will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or variable rate in making financing decisions we will consider factors including but not limited to 

  



 our indebtedness may be recourse nonrecourse crosscollateralized crossdefaulted secured or unsecured in addition we may invest in stores subject to existing loans collateralized by mortgages or similar liens or may refinance stores acquired on a leveraged basis we may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness to refinance investments including the redevelopment of existing stores for general working capital or to purchase additional interests in partnerships or joint ventures or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable 

as of december 31 2018  we had 57496  available in cash and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts during 2018  and 2017  we experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash or cash equivalents however there can be no assurance that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 

as of december 31 2018  we had 4854077  face value of debt resulting in a debt to total enterprise value ratio of 284  as of december 31 2017  we had 4601322 face value of debt resulting in a debt total enterprise value ratio of 281 as of december 31 2018  the ratio of total fixedrate debt and other instruments to total debt was 741  including 2192550  on which we have interest rate swaps that have been included as fixedrate debt as of december 31 2017  the ratio of total fixedrate debt and other instruments to total debt was 747 including 2283049 on which we have interest rate swaps that have been included as fixedrate debt the weighted average interest rate of the total of fixed and variablerate debt at december 31 2018  and 2017  was 35  and 33 respectively certain of our real estate assets are pledged as collateral for our debt we are subject to certain restrictive covenants relating to our outstanding debt we were in compliance with all financial covenants at december 31 2018  

we expect to fund our shortterm liquidity requirements including operating expenses recurring capital expenditures dividends to stockholders distributions to holders of operating partnership units and interest on our outstanding indebtedness out of our operating cash flow cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving lines of credit in addition we are pursuing additional sources of financing based on anticipated funding needs 

our liquidity needs consist primarily of operating expenses monthly debt service payments recurring capital expenditures dividends to stockholders and distributions to unit holders necessary to maintain our reit qualification we may from time to time seek to repurchase our outstanding debt shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors in addition we evaluate on an ongoing basis the merits of strategic acquisitions and other relationships which may require us to raise additional funds we may also use operating partnership units as currency to fund acquisitions from selfstorage owners who desire taxdeferral in their exiting transactions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes further except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitments or intent to provide funding to any such entities accordingly we are not materially exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 

contractual obligations 

the following table presents information on future payments due by period as of december 31 2018  



the operating leases above include minimum future lease payments on leases for 23  of our operating stores as well as leases of our corporate offices three  ground leases include additional contingent rental payments based on the level of revenue achieved at the store 

as of december 31 2018  the weighted average interest rate for all fixed rate loans was 34  and the weighted average interest rate on all variable rate loans was 39

seasonality 

the selfstorage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations a greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from may through september historically our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of july while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early march results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our future income cash flows and fair values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary and tax policies domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 49  billion in total face value debt of which approximately 13  billion was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 126  million annually 

interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur further in the event of a change of that magnitude we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure 

derivative instruments 

we use derivative instruments to help manage interest rate risk using designated hedge relationships interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixedrate and variablerate interest payments between two parties based on a contractual underlying notional amount but do not involve the exchange of the underlying notional amounts see our derivatives footnote in our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information about our use of derivative contracts

management 

members of our executive management team have significant experience in all aspects of the selfstorage industry our executive management team and their years of industry experience are as follows joseph d margolis chief executive officer 13 years scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer 17 years samrat sondhi executive vice president and chief operating officer 14 years gwyn mcneal executive vice president and chief legal officer 12 years james overturf executive vice president and chief marketing officer 19 years and kenneth m woolley executive chairman 39 years 

our executive management team and board of directors have an ownership position in the company with executive officers and directors owning approximately 4059669 shares or 32 of our outstanding common stock as of february 21 2018  

industry  competition 

stores offer monthtomonth rental of storage space for personal or business use tenants typically rent fully enclosed spaces that vary in size and typically range from 5 feet by 5 feet to 20 feet by 20 feet with an interior height of 8 feet to 12 feet tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units stores generally have onsite managers who supervise and run the daytoday operations providing tenants with assistance as needed 

selfstorage provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions due to life changes or simply because of a need for storage space the mix of residential tenants using a store is determined by a store’s local demographics and often includes people who are experiencing life changes such as downsizing their living space or others who are not yet settled into a permanent residence items that tenants place in selfstorage are typically furniture household items and appliances commercial tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods records inventory or storage for seasonal goods 

our research has shown that tenants choose a store based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or business making highdensity hightraffic population centers ideal locations for stores a store’s price perceived security cleanliness and the general professionalism of the site managers and staff are also contributing factors to a site’s ability to successfully secure rentals although most stores are leased to tenants on a monthtomonth basis tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time 

the selfstorage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations a greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from may through september historically our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of july while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early march 

since inception in the early 1970’s the selfstorage industry has experienced significant growth the selfstorage industry has also seen increases in occupancy over the past several years according to the selfstorage almanac the “almanac” in 2012 the national average physical occupancy rate was 850  of net rentable square feet compared to an average physical occupancy rate of 928  in 2017 

the industry is also characterized by fragmented ownership according to the almanac as of the end of 2017  the top ten selfstorage companies in the united states operated approximately 158  of the total us stores and the top 50 selfstorage companies operated approximately 192  of the total us stores we believe this fragmentation will contribute to continued consolidation at some level in the future 

recently we have encountered competition when we have sought to acquire existing operating stores especially for brokered portfolios competitive bidding practices have been commonplace between both public and private entities and this will likely continue we believe that we are well positioned to compete for acquisitions 

we are the second largest selfstorage operator in the united states we are one of five public selfstorage reits along with cubesmart national storage affiliates life storage and public storage 

longterm growth and investment strategies 

our primary business objectives are to maximize cash flow available for distribution to our stockholders and to achieve sustainable longterm growth in cash flow per share in order to maximize longterm stockholder value both at acceptable levels of risk we continue to evaluate a range of growth initiatives and opportunities our primary strategies include the following 

maximize the performance of our stores through strategic efficient and proactive management   

we pursue revenuegenerating and expenseminimizing opportunities in our operations our revenue management team seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our advanced technology systems ability to provide realtime interactive rental rate and discount management our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement more effective online marketing programs which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost 

we continually analyze our portfolio to look for longterm valueenhancing opportunities we proactively redevelop properties to add units or modify existing unit mix to better meet the demand in a given market and to maximize revenue we also redevelop properties to reduce their effective useful age increase visual appeal enhance security and to improve brand consistency across the portfolio 

acquire self storage stores   

our acquisitions team continues to pursue the acquisition of multistore portfolios and single stores that we believe can provide stockholder value we have established a reputation as a reliable ethical buyer which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions in addition we believe our status as an upreit enables flexibility when structuring deals we remain a disciplined buyer and only execute acquisitions that we believe will strengthen our portfolio and increase stockholder value 

in addition to the pursuit of stabilized stores we also develop stores from the ground up and provide the construction capital we also purchase stores at the completion of construction from third party developers who build to our specifications these stores purchased at completion of construction a certificate of occupancy store create additional long term value for our stockholders we are typically able to acquire these assets at a lower price than a stabilized store and expect greater long term returns on these stores on average however in the short term these acquisitions cause dilution to our earnings during the twotofour year period required to lease up the certificate of occupancy stores we expect that this trend will continue in 2018 as we continue to acquire certificate of occupancy stores 

expand our management business 

our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees as well as expand our geographic footprint data sophistication and scale with little capital investment we believe this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale in addition we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline we pursue strategic relationships with owners whose stores would enhance our portfolio in the event an opportunity arises to acquire such stores 

financing of our longterm growth strategies 

acquisition and development financing 

as a reit we are required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income to our stockholders consequently we require access to additional sources of capital to fund our growth we expect to maintain a flexible approach to financing growth we plan to finance future acquisitions through a diverse capital optimization strategy which includes but is not limited to cash generated from operations borrowings under our revolving lines of credit the credit lines secured and unsecured financing equity offerings joint ventures and sale of properties 

credit lines  we have two credit lines which we primarily use as short term bridge financing until we obtain longerterm financing through either debt or equity as of december 31 2017  our credit lines had available capacity of 6000 million  of which 5060 million  was undrawn 

secured and unsecured debt   historically we have primarily used traditional secured mortgage loans to finance store acquisitions and development efforts more recently we obtained unsecured bank term loans and issued unsecured private placement bonds we will continue to utilize a combination of secured and unsecured financing for future store acquisitions and development as of december 31 2017  we had 28 billion  of secured notes payable and 17 billion  of unsecured notes payable outstanding compared to 29 billion  secured notes payable and 10 billion  unsecured notes payable outstanding as of december 31 2016  

equity  we have an active at the market atm program for selling stock we sell stock under the atm program from time to time to raise capital when we believe conditions are advantageous during the year ended december 31 2016  we issued 1381300 shares of common stock through our atm program and received proceeds of approximately 1234 million no shares were issued under the atm program during the year ended december 31 2017  

we view equity interests in our operating partnership as a potential source of capital that can also provide attractive tax planning opportunities to sellers of real estate we issue common and preferred operating partnership units to sellers in certain acquisitions common operating partnership units receive distributions equal to the dividends on common stock while preferred operating partnership units receive distributions at various negotiated rates we may issue additional units in the future when circumstances are favorable 

joint venture financing  as of december 31 2017  we owned 215  of our stores through joint ventures with third parties our joint venture partners typically provide most of the equity capital required for the acquisition of stores owned in these joint ventures most joint venture agreements include buysell rights as well as rights of first offer in connection with the sale of stores by the joint venture we generally manage the daytoday operations of the stores owned in these joint ventures and have the right to participate in major decisions relating to sales of stores or financings by the applicable joint venture 

sale of properties  we have not historically sold a high volume of stores as we generally believe we are able to optimize the cash flow from stores through continued operations however we may sell more stores or interests in stores in the future in response to changing economic financial or investment conditions for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016 we sold 36 stores into a joint venture and nine stores to an outside party respectively for approximately 2950 million  and 303 million 

regulation 

generally stores are subject to various laws ordinances and regulations including regulations relating to lien sale rights and procedures and the americans with disabilities act of 1990 changes in any of these laws or regulations as well as changes in laws such as the comprehensive environmental response and compensation liability act which increase the potential liability for environmental conditions or circumstances existing or created by tenants or others on stores or laws affecting development construction operation upkeep safety and taxation may result in significant unanticipated expenditures loss of stores or other impairments to operations which would adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition noncompliance with any of these laws ordinances or regulations could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could require substantial capital expenditures to ensure compliance 

insurance activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state in accordance with the mccarranferguson act and are subject to the grammleachbliley act and the privacy regulations promulgated by the federal trade commission pursuant thereto store management activities may be subject to state real estate brokerage laws and regulations as determined by the particular real estate commission for each state changes in any of the laws governing our conduct could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business or could materially affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

employees 

as of december 31 2017  we had 3380  employees and believe our relationship with our employees is good our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement 




 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our securities involves various risks all investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information contained in this annual report before trading in our securities if any of the events set forth in the following risks actually occur our business operating results prospects and financial condition could be harmed 

our performance is subject to risks associated with real estate investments we are a real estate company that derives our income from the operation of our stores there are a number of factors that may adversely affect the income that our stores generate including the following 

risks related to our stores and operations 

adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating results 

our revenues and net operating income can be negatively impacted by general economic factors that lead to a reduction in demand for rental space in the markets in which we operate 

if we are unable to promptly relet our units or if the rates upon such reletting are significantly lower than expected our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

virtually all of our leases are on a monthtomonth basis any delay in reletting units as vacancies arise would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results in addition lower than expected rental rates upon reletting could adversely affect our revenues and impede our growth 

uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flow 

we maintain comprehensive property and casualty insurance policies including liability fire flood earthquake wind as we deem necessary or as required by our lenders umbrella coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our stores certain types of losses however may be either uninsurable not economically insurable or coverage may be excluded on certain policies such as losses due to earthquakes hurricanes tornadoes riots acts of war terrorism or social engineering should an uninsured loss occur we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a store in addition if any such loss is insured we may be required to pay significant amounts on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to our insurer being obligated to reimburse us for the loss or the amount of the loss may exceed our coverage for the loss as a result our operating results may be adversely affected 

legal disputes settlement and defense costs could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

from time to time we have to make monetary settlements or defend actions or arbitration including class actions to resolve tenant employmentrelated or other claims and disputes settling any such liabilities could negatively impact our operating results and cash available for distribution to stockholders and could also adversely affect our ability to sell lease operate or encumber affected properties 

our tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation which may adversely affect our results 

our tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation the regulatory authorities generally have broad discretion to grant renew and revoke licenses and approvals to promulgate interpret and implement regulations and to evaluate compliance with regulations through periodic examinations audits and investigations of the affairs of insurance providers as a result of regulatory or private action in any jurisdiction we may be temporarily or permanently suspended from continuing some or all of our reinsurance activities or otherwise fined or penalized or suffer an adverse judgment which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our stores may adversely affect our results of operations 

under various us federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances which could be substantial such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release or presence of such hazardous substances from time to time we may acquire properties or interests in properties with known adverse environmental conditions for which we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior riskadjusted return 

costs associated with complying with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 may result in unanticipated expenses 

under the ada places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons a number of additional us federal state and local laws may also require modifications to our stores or restrict certain further renovations of the stores with respect to access thereto by disabled persons if one or more of our stores is not in compliance with the ada or other legislation then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the facility into compliance 

there is significant competition among selfstorage operators and from other storage alternatives 

competition in the local markets in which many of our stores are located is significant and has affected our occupancy levels rental rates and operating expenses development of selfstorage facilities has increased in recent years which has intensified competition and we expect it will continue to do so as newly developed facilities are opened development of selfstorage facilities by other operators could continue to increase in the future actions by our competitors may decrease or prevent increases in our occupancy and rental rates while increasing our operating expenses which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria which may impede our growth 

our ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy we may not be successful in identifying suitable stores or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions 

or investments on satisfactory terms or at all failure to identify or consummate acquisitions will slow our growth which could in turn adversely affect our stock price 

our ability to acquire stores on favorable terms and successfully integrate and operate them may be constrained by the following significant risks 

 we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes including financial transactions and records personally identifiable information and tenant and lease data we purchase some of our information technology from vendors on whom our systems depend we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential tenant and other sensitive information although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems it is possible that our safety and security measures will not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning or damage or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyberattacks security breaches including physical or electronic breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar breaches can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information while to date we have not experienced a security breach this risk has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication of such breaches and attempted breaches from around the world have increased any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation divert significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

risks related to our organization and structure 

conflicts of interest could arise as a result of our relationship with our operating partnership 

conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates and our operating partnership or any partner thereof our directors and officers have duties to our company under applicable maryland law in connection with their management of our company at the same time we through our whollyowned subsidiary have fiduciary duties as a general partner to our operating partnership and to the limited partners under delaware law in connection with the management of our operating partnership our duties through our whollyowned subsidiary as a general partner to our operating partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our company the partnership agreement of our operating partnership does not require us to resolve such conflicts in favor of either our company or the limited partners in our operating partnership unless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement delaware law generally requires a general partner of a delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith fairness and loyalty and which generally prohibit such general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest 

additionally the partnership agreement expressly limits our liability by providing that neither we our direct whollyowned massachusetts business trust subsidiary as the general partner of the operating partnership nor any of our or their trustees directors or officers will be liable or accountable in damages to our operating partnership the limited partners or assignees for errors in judgment mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if we or such trustee director or officer acted in good faith in addition our operating partnership is required to indemnify us our affiliates and each of our respective trustees officers directors employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against any and all losses claims damages liabilities whether joint or several expenses including without limitation attorneys’ fees and other legal fees and expenses judgments fines settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims demands actions suits or 

proceedings civil criminal administrative or investigative that relate to the operations of the operating partnership provided that our operating partnership will not indemnify for 1 willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law 2 any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement or 3 in the case of a criminal proceeding the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful 

the provisions of delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement 

our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority 

as of december 31 2017  we held interests in 215  operating stores through joint ventures some of these arrangements could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority our reliance on coventurers financial conditions and disputes between us and our coventurers we expect to continue our joint venture strategy by entering into more joint ventures for the purpose of developing new stores and acquiring existing stores in such event we would not be in a position to exercise sole decisionmaking authority regarding the property partnership joint venture or other entity the decisionmaking authority regarding the stores we currently hold through joint ventures is either vested exclusively with our joint venture partners is subject to a majority vote of the joint venture partners or is equally shared by us and the joint venture partners in addition investments in partnerships joint ventures or other entities may under certain circumstances involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or coventurers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions partners or coventurers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions such as a sale because neither we nor the partner or coventurer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or coventurers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers andor directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or coventurers might result in subjecting stores owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our thirdparty partners or coventurers which could harm our financial condition 

certain provisions of maryland law and our organizational documents including the stock ownership limit imposed by our charter may inhibit market activity in our stock and could prevent or delay a change in control transaction 

our charter subject to certain exceptions authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a reit and to limit any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding common stock or 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limit however our board of directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership limit to any proposed transferee whose ownership could jeopardize our qualification as a reit these restrictions on ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the ownership limit may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders different ownership limits apply to the family of kenneth m woolley certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing to spencer f kirk certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and to certain designated investment entities as defined in our charter 

our board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder approval in addition our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares our board of directors could issue additional shares of our common stock or establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise not be in the best interests of our stockholders 

our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited 

maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances in addition our charter eliminates our directors’ and officers’ liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law as a result we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law in addition we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers 

risks related to our debt financings 

disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us 

uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to refinance existing debt maturities on favorable terms or at all which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions and fund development projects a downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell stores or may adversely affect the price we receive for stores that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing 

required payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our stores or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations 

as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 46 billion  of outstanding indebtedness we may incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions and development we may borrow under our credit lines or borrow new funds to finance these future stores additionally we do not anticipate that our internally generated cash flow will be adequate to repay our existing indebtedness upon maturity and therefore we expect to repay our indebtedness through refinancings and equity andor debt offerings further we may need to borrow funds in order to make cash distributions to maintain our qualification as a reit or to make our expected distributions to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our net taxable income each year excluding net capital gains and we are subject to us federal corporate income tax to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income each year 

if we are required to utilize our credit lines for purposes other than acquisition activity this will reduce the amount available for acquisitions and could slow our growth therefore our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences including the following 



increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service 

our indebtedness and make cash distributions to our stockholders 

as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 46 billion  of debt outstanding of which approximately 12 billion  or 253 was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps this variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 31  per annum increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase our interest expense which could harm our cash flow and our ability to pay cash distributions 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations 

in certain cases we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements hedging involves risks such as the risk that the counterparty may fail to honor its obligations under an arrangement failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders 

risks related to qualification and operation as a reit 

dividends payable by reits may be taxed at higher rates 

dividends payable by reits may be taxed at higher rates than dividends of nonreit corporations the maximum us federal income tax rate for qualified dividends paid by domestic nonreit corporations to us stockholders that are individuals trust or estates is generally 20 dividends paid by reits to such stockholders are generally not eligible for that rate but under the 2017 tax legislation defined below such stockholders may deduct up to 20 of ordinary dividends from a reit for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by reits such tax rate may still higher than the tax rate applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends this may cause investors to view reit investments as less attractive than investments in nonreit corporations which in turn may adversely affect the value of stock of reits including our stock in addition the relative attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends which could negatively affect the value of our stores 

possible legislative or other actions affecting reits could adversely affect our stockholders 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us department of the treasury changes to the tax laws with or without retroactive application could adversely affect our investors or us in ways we cannot predict new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit the us federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the us federal income tax consequences of an investment in us also the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities or an investment in other entities could change making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit 

recently enacted us tax legislation the “2017 tax legislation” has significantly changed the us federal income taxation of us businesses and their owners including reits and their stockholders changes made by the 2017 tax legislation that could affect us and our stockholders include 

 

many of these changes are effective immediately without any transition periods or grandfathering for existing transactions the legislation is unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the treasury and irs any of which could lessen or increase the impact of the legislation in addition it is unclear how these us federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities while some of the changes made by the tax legislation may adversely affect us in one or more reporting periods and prospectively other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis we are continuing to work with our tax advisors to determine the full impact that the recent federal tax reform legislation which we refer to herein as the 2017 tax legislations as a whole will have on us 

our failure to qualify as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock 

we believe we operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit or lose our qualification as a reit at any time we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution for each of the years involved because 

  

 in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits this means that our us individual stockholders would be taxed on our dividends at capital gains rates and our us corporate stockholders would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends subject in each case to applicable limitations under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes and are able to avail ourselves of one or more of the relief provisions under the internal revenue code in order to maintain our reit status we may nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of 50000 or more for each such failure as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our securities 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the internal revenue code is greater in the case of a reit that like us holds its assets through a partnership the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the composition of our assets the sources of our gross income and the owners of our stock our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market value of our assets some of which are not susceptible to precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals our ability to satisfy the income tests depends on the sources and amounts of our gross income which we may not be able to control also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our net taxable income excluding capital gains and we will be subject to us federal corporate income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income including capital gains in addition legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors our ability to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that is intended to allow us to qualify for taxation as a reit we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the internal revenue service regarding our qualification as a reit 

we will pay some taxes reducing cash available for stockholders 

even though we qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we will be required to pay some us federal state and local taxes on our income and property extra space management inc manages stores for our joint ventures and stores owned by third parties we jointly with extra space management inc elected to treat extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary “trs” of our company for us federal income tax purposes a trs is a fully taxable corporation and may be limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to us esm reinsurance limited a whollyowned subsidiary of extra space management inc generates income from insurance premiums that are subject to us federal income tax and state insurance premiums tax and pays certain insurance royalties to us in addition we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements among our tenants our trs and us are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties also if we sell property as a dealer ie to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on any gain arising from such sales while we do not intend to sell stores as a dealer the irs could take a contrary position to the extent that we are or our trs is required to pay us federal state or local taxes we will have less cash available for distribution to stockholders

as of december 31 2017  we owned or had ownership interests in 1061  operating stores of these stores 846  are whollyowned one  is in a consolidated joint venture and 214  are in joint ventures in addition we managed an additional 422  stores for third parties bringing the total number of stores which we own andor manage to 1483  these stores are located in 39  states washington dc and puerto rico the majority of our stores are clustered around large population centers the clustering of assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale our acquisitions have given us an increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in many markets where we had no previous presence 

as of december 31 2017  approximately 835000  tenants were leasing storage units at the operating stores that we own andor manage primarily on a monthtomonth basis providing the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit existing tenants generally receive rate increases at least annually for which no direct correlation has been drawn to our vacancy trends although leases are shortterm in duration the typical tenant tends to remain at our stores for an extended period of time for stores that were stabilized as of december 31 2017  the average length of stay was approximately 146  months 

the average annual rent per square foot for our existing customers at stabilized stores net of discounts and bad debt was 1598  for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to 1530  for the year ended december 31 2016  average annual rent per square foot for new leases was 1677  for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to 1596  for the year ended december 31 2016  the average discounts as a percentage of rental revenues during these periods were 39  and 36  respectively 

our store portfolio is made up of different types of construction and building configurations most often sites are what we consider “hybrid” facilities a mix of both driveup buildings and multifloor buildings we have a number of multifloor buildings with elevator access only and a number of facilities featuring groundfloor access only

overview 

we are a fully integrated selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust “reit” formed to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop selfstorage properties “stores” we derive substantially all of our revenues from our two segments storage operations and tenant reinsurance primary sources of revenue for our storage operations segment include rents received from tenants under leases at each of our whollyowned stores our operating results depend materially on our ability to lease available selfstorage units to actively manage unit rental rates and on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments consequently management spends a significant portion of their time maximizing cash flows from our diverse portfolio of stores revenue from our tenant reinsurance segment consists of insurance revenues from the reinsurance of risks relating to the loss of goods stored by tenants in the companys stores our segment presentation has changed from the prior year and all applicable information has been reclassified to conform to the current years segment presentation 

our stores are generally situated in highly visible locations clustered around large population centers these areas enjoy above average population growth and income levels the clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale to maximize the performance of our stores we employ industryleading revenue management systems developed by our management team these systems enable us to analyze set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions we believe our systems and processes allow us to more proactively manage revenues 

we operate in competitive markets often where consumers have multiple stores from which to choose competition has impacted and will continue to impact our store results we experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity we believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the combination of our revenue management team and our industryleading technology systems we consider a store to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization we consider a store to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 of the current year or has been open for three years prior to january 1 of the current year 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those that impact our most critical accounting policies we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances a summary of significant accounting policies is also provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements actual results may differ from these estimates we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies and estimates 

consolidation  arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as variable interest entities “vies” an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it is the primary beneficiary of the vie 

we have concluded that under certain circumstances when we enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures a vie may be created for each vie created we have performed a qualitative analysis including considering which party if any has the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of each vie and whether that party has the obligation to absorb losses of the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could be significant to the vie if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie the assets liabilities and operations of the vie are consolidated with our financial statements otherwise our investment is generally accounted for under the equity method our ability to correctly assess the influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of the investment in our consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2017  we had no consolidated vies additionally our operating partnership has notes payable to three trusts that are considered vies since the operating partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts these vies are not consolidated 

real estate assets   we account for the acquisition of stores including by merger and other acquisitions of real estate in accordance with asc 80510  business combinations   we use our judgment to determine if assets acquired meet the definition of a business or if the acquisition should be considered an asset acquisition subsequent to our january 1 2017 adoption of asu 201701 business combinations topic 805  clarifying the definition of a business   we must make significant assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired and consideration transferred these assumptions and estimates require judgment and therefore others could come to materially different conclusions as to the estimated fair values which could result in differences in depreciation and amortization expense gains and losses on the purchase and sale of real estate assets and real estate and intangible asset values 

evaluation of asset impairment  long lived assets held for use are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment we review each store at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist we focus on stores where occupancy andor rental income have decreased by a significant amount for these stores we determine whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the store will likely recover the lost occupancy andor revenue in the short term in addition we review stores in the leaseup stage and compare actual operating results to original projections we may not have identified all material facts and circumstances that affect impairment of our stores no material impairments were recorded in the year ended december 31 2017 

derivative instruments and hedging activities  we hold a number of derivative instruments which we use to hedge our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows mainly related to our interest rates on variable interest debt we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes we assess our derivatives both at inception and on an ongoing quarterly basis for whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are effective any ineffective portion of a derivative financial instruments change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings the rules and interpretations relating to the accounting for derivatives are complex failure to apply this guidance correctly may require us to recognize all changes in fair value of the hedged derivative in earnings which may materially impact our results 

income taxes  we have elected to be treated as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code in order to maintain our qualification as a reit among other things we are required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets as a reit we are not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to our stockholders we plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex for any taxable year that we fail to qualify as a reit and for which applicable statutory relief provisions did not apply we would be subject to federal corporate income tax on all of our 

taxable income for at least that year and the ensuing four years we could also be subject to penalties and interest and our net income may be materially different from the amounts reported in our financial statements 

we have elected to treat one of our corporate subsidiaries extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary “trs” in general our trs may perform additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or nonreal estate related business a trs is subject to federal corporate income tax interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense when incurred if tax authorities determine that amounts paid by our taxable reit subsidiaries to us are not reasonable compared to similar arrangements among unrelated parties we could be subject to a penalty tax on the excess payments

funds from operations 

ffo provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary along with net income and cash flows for an understanding of our operating results we believe ffo is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings net earnings assume that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses the values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and we believe ffo more accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts inc “nareit” as net income computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” excluding gains or losses on sales of operating stores and impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate assets plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis we believe that to further understand our performance ffo should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with gaap as presented in the consolidated financial statements ffo should not be considered a replacement of net income computed in accordance with gaap 

the computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions

liquidity and capital resources 

financing strategy 

we will continue to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts reviewed from time to time by our board of directors although our board of directors has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur we will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or variable rate in making financing decisions we will consider factors including but not limited to 

  



 our indebtedness may be recourse nonrecourse crosscollateralized crossdefaulted secured or unsecured in addition we may invest in stores subject to existing loans collateralized by mortgages or similar liens or may refinance stores acquired on a leveraged basis we may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness to refinance investments including the redevelopment of existing stores for general working capital or to purchase additional interests in partnerships or joint ventures or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable 

as of december 31 2017  we had 55683  available in cash and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts during 2017  and 2016  we experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash or cash equivalents however there can be no assurance that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 

as of december 31 2017  we had 4601322  face value of debt resulting in a debt to total enterprise value ratio of 281  as of december 31 2016  we had 4363697 face value of debt resulting in a debt total enterprise value ratio of 296 as of december 31 2017  the ratio of total fixedrate debt and other instruments to total debt was 747  including 2283049  on which we have interest rate swaps that have been included as fixedrate debt as of december 31 2016  the ratio of total fixedrate debt and other instruments to total debt was 700 including 2198275 on which we have interest rate swaps that have been included as fixedrate debt the weighted average interest rate of the total of fixed and variablerate debt at december 31 2017  and 2016  was 33  and 30 respectively certain of our real estate assets are pledged as collateral for our debt we are subject to certain restrictive covenants relating to our outstanding debt we were in compliance with all financial covenants at december 31 2017  

we expect to fund our shortterm liquidity requirements including operating expenses recurring capital expenditures dividends to stockholders distributions to holders of operating partnership units and interest on our outstanding indebtedness out of our operating cash flow cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving lines of credit in addition we are pursuing additional sources of financing based on anticipated funding needs 

our liquidity needs consist primarily of cash distributions to stockholders store acquisitions principal payments under our borrowings and nonrecurring capital expenditures we may from time to time seek to repurchase our outstanding debt shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors in addition we evaluate on an ongoing basis the merits of strategic acquisitions and other relationships which may require us to raise additional funds we may also use operating partnership units as currency to fund acquisitions from selfstorage owners who desire taxdeferral in their exiting transactions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes further except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitments or intent to provide funding to any such entities accordingly we are not materially exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 

contractual obligations 

the following table presents information on future payments due by period as of december 31 2017  



the operating leases above include minimum future lease payments on leases for 23  of our operating stores as well as leases of our corporate offices three  ground leases include additional contingent rental payments based on the level of revenue achieved at the store 

as of december 31 2017  the weighted average interest rate for all fixed rate loans was 33  and the weighted average interest rate on all variable rate loans was 31  

for more information on our contractual obligations related to real estate acquisitions refer to our commitments and contingencies footnote in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

seasonality 

the selfstorage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations a greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from may through september historically our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of july while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early march results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our future income cash flows and fair values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary and tax policies domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 46  billion in total face value debt of which approximately 12  billion was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 116  million annually 

interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur further in the event of a change of that magnitude we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure 

derivative instruments 

we use derivative instruments to help manage interest rate risk using designated hedge relationships interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixedrate and variablerate interest payments between two parties based on a contractual underlying notional amount but do not involve the exchange of the underlying notional amounts see our derivatives footnote in our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information about our use of derivative contracts

management 

members of our executive management team have significant experience in all aspects of the selfstorage industry having acquired andor developed a significant number of stores since before our ipo our executive management team and their years of industry experience are as follows joseph d margolis chief executive officer 12 years scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer 16 years samrat sondhi executive vice president and chief operating officer 13 years gwyn mcneal executive vice president and chief legal officer 11 years james overturf executive vice president and chief marketing officer 18 years and kenneth m woolley executive chairman 36 years spencer f kirk served as our chief executive officer through december 31 2016 and continues to serve on the companys board of directors joseph d margolis succeeded mr kirk as the companys chief executive officer effective january 1 2017 

our executive management team and board of directors have a significant ownership position in the company with executive officers and directors owning approximately 4665566 shares or 37 of our outstanding common stock as of february 21 2017  

industry  competition 

stores offer monthtomonth storage space rental for personal or business use and are a costeffective and flexible storage alternative tenants rent fully enclosed spaces that can vary in size according to their specific needs and to which they have unlimited exclusive access tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units selfstorage unit sizes typically range from 5 feet by 5 feet to 20 feet by 20 feet with an interior height of 8 feet to 12 feet stores generally have onsite managers who supervise and run the daytoday operations providing tenants with assistance as needed 

selfstorage provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions due to life changes or simply because of a need for storage space the mix of residential tenants using a store is determined by a store’s local demographics and often includes people who are looking to downsize their living space or others who are not yet settled into a permanent residence items that residential tenants place in selfstorage range from cars boats and recreational vehicles to furniture household items and appliances commercial tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods records inventory or storage for seasonal goods 

our research has shown that tenants choose a store based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or business making highdensity hightraffic population centers ideal locations for stores a store’s perceived security and the general professionalism of the site managers and staff are also contributing factors to a site’s ability to successfully secure rentals although most stores are leased to tenants on a monthtomonth basis tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time 

the selfstorage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations a greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from may through september historically our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of july while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early march 

since inception in the early 1970’s the selfstorage industry has experienced significant growth the selfstorage industry has also seen increases in occupancy over the past several years according to the selfstorage almanac the “almanac” in 2008 the national average physical occupancy rate was 803 of net rentable square feet compared to an average physical occupancy rate of 912 in 2016 

recently we have encountered competition when we have sought to acquire stores especially for brokered portfolios competitive bidding practices have been commonplace between both public and private entities and this will likely continue 

the industry is also characterized by fragmented ownership according to the almanac the top ten selfstorage companies in the united states operated approximately 194 of the total us stores and the top 50 selfstorage companies operated approximately 286 of the total us stores as of december 31 2016  we believe this fragmentation will contribute to continued consolidation at some level in the future we also believe that we are well positioned to compete for acquisitions 

we are the second largest selfstorage operator in the united states we are one of five public selfstorage reits along with cubesmart national storage affiliates life storage and public storage 

longterm growth and investment strategies 

our primary business objectives are to maximize cash flow available for distribution to our stockholders and to achieve sustainable longterm growth in cash flow per share in order to maximize longterm stockholder value we continue to evaluate a range of growth initiatives and opportunities including the following 

  



a disciplined buyer and only execute acquisitions that we believe will strengthen our portfolio and increase stockholder value 

 

financing of our longterm growth strategies 

acquisition and development financing 

the following table presents information on our revolving lines of credit the “credit lines” for the periods indicated all of our credit lines are guaranteed by us amounts in thousands 



we expect to maintain a flexible approach in financing new store acquisitions we plan to finance future acquisitions through a combination of cash borrowings under the credit lines traditional secured and unsecured mortgage financing joint ventures and additional debt or equity offerings 

joint venture financing 

as of december 31 2016  we own 180  of our stores through joint ventures with third parties we generally manage the daytoday operations of the underlying stores owned in these joint ventures and have the right to participate in major decisions relating to sales of stores or financings by the applicable joint venture our joint venture partners typically provide most of the equity capital required for the operation of the respective business under the operating agreements for the joint ventures we maintain the right to receive between 40 and 800 of the available cash flow from operations after our joint venture partners and the company have received a predetermined return and between 40 and 750 of the available cash flow from capital transactions after our joint venture partners and the company have received a return of their capital plus such predetermined return most joint venture agreements include buysell rights as well as rights of first offer in connection with the sale of stores by the joint venture 

disposition of stores 

we will continue to review our portfolio for stores or groups of stores that are underperforming or are not strategically located and determine whether to dispose of these stores to fund other growth as of december 31 2016  we had two  parcels of land that were categorized as held for sale 

regulation 

generally stores are subject to various laws ordinances and regulations including regulations relating to lien sale rights and procedures changes in any of these laws or regulations as well as changes in laws such as the comprehensive environmental response and compensation liability act which increase the potential liability for environmental conditions or circumstances existing or created by tenants or others on stores or laws affecting development construction operation upkeep safety and taxation may result in significant unanticipated expenditures loss of stores or other impairments to operations which would adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

under the americans with disabilities act of 1990 the “ada” places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these requirements became effective in 1992 a number of additional us federal state and local laws also exist that may require modifications to the stores or restrict further renovations thereof with respect to access thereto by disabled persons noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature thereby requiring substantial capital expenditures to the extent our stores are not in compliance we are likely to incur additional costs to comply with the ada 

insurance activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state in accordance with the mccarranferguson act and are subject to the grammleachbliley act and the privacy regulations promulgated by the federal trade commission pursuant thereto 

store management activities are often subject to state real estate brokerage laws and regulations as determined by the particular real estate commission for each state 

changes in any of the laws governing our conduct could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business or could materially affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

employees 

as of february 21 2017  we had 3287  employees and believe our relationship with our employees is good our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement 




 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our securities involves various risks all investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information contained in this annual report before trading in our securities if any of the events set forth in the following risks actually occur our business operating results prospects and financial condition could be harmed 

our performance is subject to risks associated with real estate investments we are a real estate company that derives our income from operation of our stores there are a number of factors that may adversely affect the income that our stores generate including the following 

risks related to our stores and operations 

adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating results 

our operating results are dependent upon our ability to maximize occupancy levels and rental rates in our stores adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we operate may lower our occupancy levels and limit our ability to increase rents or require us to offer rental discounts if our stores fail to generate revenues sufficient to meet our cash requirements including operating and other expenses debt service and capital expenditures our net income funds from operations “ffo” cash flow financial condition ability to make cash distributions to stockholders and the trading price of our securities could be adversely affected the following factors among others may adversely affect the operating performance of our stores 

  



 if we are unable to promptly relet our units or if the rates upon such reletting are significantly lower than expected our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

virtually all of our leases are on a monthtomonth basis any delay in reletting units as vacancies arise would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results in addition lower than expected rental rates upon reletting could adversely affect our revenues and impede our growth 

we depend upon our onsite personnel to maximize tenant satisfaction at each of our stores and any difficulties we encounter in hiring training and maintaining skilled field personnel may harm our operating performance 

we had 2723  field personnel as of february 21 2017  in the management and operation of our stores the general professionalism of our store managers and staff are contributing factors to a store’s ability to successfully secure rentals and retain tenants we also rely upon our field personnel to maintain clean and secure stores if we are unable to successfully recruit train and retain qualified field personnel the quality of service we strive to provide at our stores could be adversely affected which could lead to decreased occupancy levels and reduced operating performance 

uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flow 

we maintain comprehensive liability fire flood earthquake wind as deemed necessary or as required by our lenders extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our stores certain types of losses however may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable such as losses due to earthquakes hurricanes tornadoes riots acts of war or terrorism should an uninsured loss occur we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a store in addition if any such loss is insured we may be required to pay significant amounts on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to our insurer being obligated to reimburse us for the loss or the amount of the loss may exceed our coverage for the loss as a result our operating results may be adversely affected 

increases in taxes and regulatory compliance costs may reduce our income 

costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws generally are not passed through to tenants directly and will affect us increases in income property or other taxes generally are not passed through to tenants under leases and may reduce our net income ffo cash flow financial condition ability to pay or refinance our debt obligations ability to make cash distributions to stockholders and the trading price of our securities similarly changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on stores or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which could similarly adversely affect our business and results of operations 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our stores may affect our results of operations 

under various us federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations owners and operators of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigating and remediating certain hazardous substances or other regulated materials on or in such property such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such substances or materials the presence of such substances or materials or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s or operator’s ability to lease sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances or other regulated materials may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials into the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real stores for personal injury associated with asbestoscontaining materials 

certain environmental laws also impose liability without regard to knowledge or fault for removal or remediation of hazardous substances or other regulated materials upon owners and operators of contaminated property even after they no 

longer own or operate the property moreover the past or present owner or operator from which a release emanates could be liable for any personal injuries or property damages that may result from such releases as well as any damages to natural resources that may arise from such releases 

certain environmental laws impose compliance obligations on owners and operators of real property with respect to the management of hazardous materials and other regulated substances for example environmental laws govern the management of asbestoscontaining materials and leadbased paint failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties or other sanctions 

no assurances can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of our stores reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner or operator of our stores did not create any material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our stores there also exists the risk that material environmental conditions liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future finally future laws ordinances or regulations and future interpretations of existing laws ordinances or regulations may impose additional material environmental liability 

costs associated with complying with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 may result in unanticipated expenses 

under the ada places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these requirements became effective in 1992 a number of additional us federal state and local laws may also require modifications to our stores or restrict certain further renovations of the stores with respect to access thereto by disabled persons noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature which could result in substantial capital expenditures we have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our stores to determine our compliance and we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with the ada or other legislation if one or more of our stores is not in compliance with the ada or other legislation then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the facility into compliance if we incur substantial costs to comply with the ada or other legislation our financial condition results of operations cash flow per share trading price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make cash distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected 

our tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation which may adversely affect our results 

our tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation the regulatory authorities generally have broad discretion to grant renew and revoke licenses and approvals to promulgate interpret and implement regulations and to evaluate compliance with regulations through periodic examinations audits and investigations of the affairs of insurance providers as a result of regulatory or private action in any jurisdiction we may be temporarily or permanently suspended from continuing some or all of our reinsurance activities or otherwise fined or penalized or suffer an adverse judgment which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we face competition for the acquisition of stores and other assets which may impede our ability to make future acquisitions or may increase the cost of these acquisitions 

we compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of stores and other assets including national regional and local operators and developers of stores these competitors may drive up the price we pay for stores or other assets we seek to acquire or may succeed in acquiring those stores or assets themselves in addition our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive suitors because they may have greater resources may be willing to pay more or may have a more compatible operating philosophy in addition the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment in stores may increase this competition would result in increased demand for these assets and therefore increased prices paid for them because of an increased interest in singlestore acquisitions among taxmotivated individual purchasers we may pay higher prices if we purchase single stores in comparison with portfolio acquisitions if we pay higher prices for stores or other assets our profitability will be reduced 

we may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria which may impede our growth 

our ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy we may not be successful in identifying suitable stores or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions 

or investments on satisfactory terms or at all failure to identify or consummate acquisitions will slow our growth which could in turn adversely affect our stock price 

our ability to acquire stores on favorable terms and successfully integrate and operate them may be constrained by the following significant risks 

  

 in addition strategic decisions by us such as acquisitions may adversely affect the price of our securities 

we may not be successful in integrating and operating acquired stores 

we have acquired many stores in the past and we expect to continue acquiring stores in the future if we acquire any stores we will be required to integrate them into our existing portfolio the acquired stores may turn out to be less compatible with our growth strategy than originally anticipated may cause disruptions in our operations or may divert management’s attention away from daytoday operations which could impair our operating results as a whole 

our investments in development and redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns which would harm our operating results and reduce the amount of funds available for distributions 

to the extent that we engage in development and redevelopment activities we will be subject to the following risks normally associated with these projects 

  

 in deciding whether to develop or redevelop a particular property we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of the store we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring the property up to the standards established for its intended market position or may be unable to increase occupancy at a newly developed store as quickly as expected or at all any substantial unanticipated delays or expenses could adversely affect the investment returns from these development or redevelopment projects and harm our operating results liquidity and financial condition which could result in a decline in the value of our securities 

we may rely on the investments of our joint venture partners for funding certain of our development and redevelopment projects if our reputation in the selfstorage industry changes or the number of investors considering us an attractive strategic partner is otherwise reduced our ability to develop or redevelop stores could be affected which would limit our growth 

we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes including financial transactions and records personally 

identifiable information and tenant and lease data we purchase some of our information technology from vendors on whom our systems depend we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential tenant and other sensitive information although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems it is possible that our safety and security measures will not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning or damage or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyberattacks security breaches including physical or electronic breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar breaches can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information while to date we have not experienced a security breach this risk has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication of such breaches and attempted breaches from around the world have increased any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation divert significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

risks related to our organization and structure 

our business could be harmed if key personnel with longstanding business relationships in the selfstorage industry terminate their employment with us 

our success depends on the continued services of members of our executive management team who have substantial experience in the selfstorage industry in addition our ability to acquire or develop stores in the future depends on the significant relationships our executive management team has developed with our institutional joint venture partners such as affiliates of prudential financial inc there is no guarantee that any of them will remain employed by us we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers the loss of services of one or more members of our executive management team could harm our business and our prospects 

we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business without stockholder consent which may subject us to different risks 

we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business at any time without the consent of our stockholders which could result in our making investments and engaging in business activities that are different from and possibly riskier than the investments and businesses described in this document a change in our investment strategy or our entry into new lines of business may increase our exposure to other risks or real estate market fluctuations 

if other selfstorage companies convert to an upreit structure or if tax laws change we may no longer have an advantage in competing for potential acquisitions 

because we are structured as an upreit we are a more attractive acquirer of stores to taxmotivated sellers than our competitors that are not structured as upreits however if other selfstorage companies restructure their holdings to become upreits this competitive advantage will disappear in addition new legislation may be enacted or new interpretations of existing legislation may be issued by the internal revenue service “irs” or the us treasury department that could affect the attractiveness of our upreit structure so that it may no longer assist us in competing for acquisitions 

tax indemnification obligations may require the operating partnership to maintain certain debt levels 

we have provided certain tax protections to various third parties in connection with their property contributions to the operating partnership upon acquisition by the company including making available the opportunity to 1 guarantee debt or 2 enter into a special loss allocation and deficit restoration obligation we have agreed to these provisions in order to assist these contributors in preserving their tax position after their contributions these obligations may require us to maintain certain indebtedness levels that we would not otherwise require for our business 

our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority 

as of december 31 2016  we held interests in 180  operating stores through joint ventures some of these arrangements could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority our reliance on coventurers financial conditions and disputes between us and our coventurers we expect to continue our joint venture strategy by entering into more joint ventures for the purpose of developing new stores and acquiring existing stores in such event we would not be in a position to exercise sole decisionmaking authority regarding the property partnership joint venture or other entity the decisionmaking authority regarding the stores we currently hold through joint ventures is either vested exclusively with our joint venture partners is subject to a majority vote of the joint venture partners or equally shared by us and the joint venture partners in addition 

investments in partnerships joint ventures or other entities may under certain circumstances involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or coventurers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions partners or coventurers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions such as a sale because neither we nor the partner or coventurer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or coventurers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers andor directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or coventurers might result in subjecting stores owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our thirdparty partners or coventurers which could harm our financial condition 

conflicts of interest could arise as a result of our relationship with our operating partnership 

conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates and our operating partnership or any partner thereof our directors and officers have duties to our company under applicable maryland law in connection with their management of our company at the same time we through our whollyowned subsidiary have fiduciary duties as a general partner to our operating partnership and to the limited partners under delaware law in connection with the management of our operating partnership our duties through our whollyowned subsidiary as a general partner to our operating partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our company the partnership agreement of our operating partnership does not require us to resolve such conflicts in favor of either our company or the limited partners in our operating partnership unless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement delaware law generally requires a general partner of a delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith fairness and loyalty and which generally prohibit such general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest 

additionally the partnership agreement expressly limits our liability by providing that neither we our direct whollyowned massachusetts business trust subsidiary as the general partner of the operating partnership nor any of our or their trustees directors or officers will be liable or accountable in damages to our operating partnership the limited partners or assignees for errors in judgment mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if we or such trustee director or officer acted in good faith in addition our operating partnership is required to indemnify us our affiliates and each of our respective trustees officers directors employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against any and all losses claims damages liabilities whether joint or several expenses including without limitation attorneys’ fees and other legal fees and expenses judgments fines settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims demands actions suits or proceedings civil criminal administrative or investigative that relate to the operations of the operating partnership provided that our operating partnership will not indemnify for 1 willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law 2 any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement or 3 in the case of a criminal proceeding the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful 

the provisions of delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement 

certain provisions of maryland law and our organizational documents including the stock ownership limit imposed by our charter may inhibit market activity in our stock and could prevent or delay a change in control transaction 

our charter subject to certain exceptions authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a reit and to limit any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding common stock or 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limit however our board of directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership limit to any proposed transferee whose ownership could jeopardize our qualification as a reit these restrictions on ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the ownership limit may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders different ownership limits apply to the family of kenneth m woolley certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing to spencer f kirk certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and to certain designated investment entities as defined in our charter 

our board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder approval in addition our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares our board of directors could issue additional shares of our common stock or establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise not be in the best interests of our stockholders 

our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited 

maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances in addition our charter eliminates our directors’ and officers’ liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law as a result we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law in addition we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers 

to the extent our distributions represent a return of capital for us federal income tax purposes our stockholders could recognize an increased capital gain upon a subsequent sale of common stock 

distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and not treated by us as a dividend will not be taxable to a us stockholder under current us federal income tax law to the extent those distributions do not exceed the stockholder’s adjusted tax basis in his her or its common stock but instead will constitute a return of capital and will reduce such adjusted basis if distributions result in a reduction of a stockholder’s adjusted basis in such holder’s common stock subsequent sales of such holder’s common stock will result in recognition of an increased capital gain or decreased capital loss due to the reduction in such adjusted basis 

risks related to the real estate industry 

our primary business involves the ownership and operation of selfstorage stores 

our current strategy is to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop only selfstorage stores consequently we are subject to risks inherent in investments in a single industry because investments in real estate are inherently illiquid this strategy makes it difficult for us to diversify our investment portfolio and to limit our risk when economic conditions change decreases in market rents negative tax real estate and zoning law changes and changes in environmental protection laws may also increase our costs lower the value of our investments and decrease our income which would adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our stores 

because real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to promptly sell one or more stores in our portfolio in response to changing economic financial and investment conditions is limited the real estate market is affected by many factors such as general economic conditions availability of financing interest rates and other factors including supply and demand that are beyond our control we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any store for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a store 

we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a store can be sold we cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements in acquiring a store we may agree to transfer restrictions that materially restrict us from selling that store for a period of time or impose other restrictions such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that store these transfer restrictions would impede our ability to sell a store even if we deem it necessary or appropriate 

any investments in unimproved real property may take significantly longer to yield incomeproducing returns if at all and may result in additional costs to us to comply with rezoning restrictions or environmental regulations 

we have invested in the past and may invest in the future in unimproved real property unimproved properties generally take longer to yield incomeproducing returns based on the typical time required for development any development of unimproved property may also expose us to the risks and uncertainties associated with rezoning the land for a higher use or development and environmental concerns of governmental entities andor community groups any unsuccessful investments or delays in realizing an incomeproducing return or increased costs to develop unimproved real estate could restrict our ability to earn our targeted rate of return on an investment or adversely affect our ability to pay operating expenses which would harm our financial condition and operating results 

any negative perceptions of the selfstorage industry generally may result in a decline in our stock price 

to the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the selfstorage industry the value of our securities may be negatively impacted which could result in our securities trading below the inherent value of our assets 

risks related to our debt financings 

disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us 

uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to refinance existing debt maturities on favorable terms or at all which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions and fund development projects a downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell stores or may adversely affect the price we receive for stores that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing 

required payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our stores or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations 

as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 44 billion  of outstanding indebtedness we may incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions and development we may borrow under our credit lines or borrow new funds to finance these future stores additionally we do not anticipate that our internally generated cash flow will be adequate to repay our existing indebtedness upon maturity and therefore we expect to repay our indebtedness through refinancings and equity andor debt offerings further we may need to borrow funds in order to make cash distributions to maintain our qualification as a reit or to make our expected distributions 

if we are required to utilize our credit lines for purposes other than acquisition activity this will reduce the amount available for acquisitions and could slow our growth therefore our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences including the following 

  



 

increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and make cash distributions to our stockholders 

as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 44 billion  of debt outstanding of which approximately 13 billion  or 300  was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps this variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 23 per annum increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase our interest expense which could harm our cash flow and our ability to pay cash distributions for example if market rates of interest on this variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 131 million  annually 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations 

in certain cases we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements hedging involves risks such as the risk that the counterparty may fail to honor its obligations under an arrangement failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders 

risks related to qualification and operation as a reit 

to maintain our qualification as a reit we may be forced to borrow funds on a shortterm basis during unfavorable market conditions 

to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our net taxable income each year excluding net capital gains and we are subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income each year in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions made by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years while historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances its own stock assuming we continue to satisfy these distributions requirements with cash we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis or possibly longterm to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these borrowing needs could result from a difference in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for us federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt amortization payments 

dividends payable by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates 

the maximum us federal income tax rate for dividends paid by domestic corporations to individual us stockholders is 20 dividends paid by reits however are generally not eligible for the reduced rates the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause stockholders who are individuals to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits including our securities 

in addition the relative attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends which could negatively affect the value of our stores 

possible legislative or other actions affecting reits could adversely affect our stockholders 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us treasury department changes to tax laws which changes may have retroactive application could adversely affect our stockholders it cannot be predicted whether when in what forms or with what effective dates the tax laws applicable to us or our stockholders will be changed 

the power of our board of directors to revoke our reit election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders 

our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election without the approval of our stockholders if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a reit if we cease to qualify as a reit we would become subject to us federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our net taxable income to our stockholders which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholders 

our failure to qualify as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock 

we believe we operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit or lose our qualification as a reit at any time we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution for each of the years involved because 

  

 in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits this means that our us individual stockholders would be taxed on our dividends at capital gains rates and our us corporate stockholders would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends subject in each case to applicable limitations under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and are able to avail ourselves of one or more of the relief provisions under the internal revenue code in order to maintain our reit status we may nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of 50000 or more for each such failure as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our securities 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the internal revenue code is greater in the case of a reit that like us holds its assets through a partnership the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the composition of our assets the sources of our gross income and the owners of our stock our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market value of our assets some of which are not susceptible to precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our net taxable income excluding capital gains and we will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income including capital gains in addition legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors our ability to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that is intended to allow us to qualify for taxation as a reit we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the internal revenue service regarding our qualification as a reit 

we will pay some taxes 

even though we qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we will be required to pay some us federal state and local taxes on our income and property extra space management inc manages stores for our joint ventures and stores owned by third parties we jointly with extra space management inc elected to treat extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary “trs” of our company for us federal income tax purposes a taxable reit subsidiary is a fully taxable corporation and may be limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to us esm reinsurance limited a whollyowned subsidiary of extra space management inc generates income from insurance premiums that are subject to federal income tax and state insurance premiums tax in addition we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements among our tenants our taxable reit subsidiary and us are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties or if we receive payments for inventory or property held for sale to customers in the 

ordinary course of business also if we sell property as a dealer ie to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on any gain arising from such sales while we do not intend to sell stores as a dealer the irs could take a contrary position to the extent that we are or our taxable reit subsidiary is required to pay us federal state or local taxes we will have less cash available for distribution to stockholders 

complying with reit requirements may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities 

to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the nature and diversification of our assets the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock in order to meet these tests we may be required to forgo attractive business or investment opportunities thus compliance with the reit requirements may adversely affect our ability to operate solely to maximize profits

 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2016  we owned or had ownership interests in 1016  operating stores of these stores 836  are whollyowned and 180  are held in joint ventures in addition we managed an additional 411  stores for third parties bringing the total number of stores which we own andor manage to 1427  these stores are located in 38  states washington dc and puerto rico we receive a management fee generally equal to approximately 60 of cash collected from total revenues to manage the joint venture and third party sites as of december 31 2016  we owned andor managed approximately 107 million  square feet of rentable space configured in approximately 960000  separate storage units approximately 70 of our stores are clustered around large population centers such as atlanta baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas houston las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san franciscooakland these markets contain aboveaverage population and income demographics for stores the clustering of assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale our acquisitions have given us an increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in many markets where we had no previous presence 

we consider a store to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization we consider a store to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 of the current year or has been open for three years prior to the january 1 of the current year 

as of december 31 2016  approximately 850000  tenants were leasing storage units at the 1427  operating stores that we own andor manage primarily on a monthtomonth basis providing the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit existing tenants generally receive rate increases at least annually for which no direct correlation has been drawn to our vacancy trends although leases are shortterm in duration the typical tenant tends to remain at our stores for an extended period of time for stores that were stabilized as of december 31 2016  the average length of stay was approximately 143  months 

the average annual rent per square foot for our existing customers at stabilized stores net of discounts and bad debt was 1588  for the year ended december 31 2016  compared to 1492  for the year ended december 31 2015  average annual rent per square foot for new leases was 1702  for the year ended december 31 2016  compared to 1591  for the year ended december 31 2015  the average discounts as a percentage of rental revenues during these periods were 33  and 32  respectively 

our store portfolio is made up of different types of construction and building configurations depending on the site and the municipality where it is located most often sites are what we consider “hybrid” facilities a mix of both driveup buildings and multifloor buildings we have a number of multifloor buildings with elevator access only and a number of facilities featuring groundfloor access only 

the following table presents additional information regarding the occupancy of our stabilized stores by state as of december 31 2016  and 2015  the information as of december 31 2015  is on a pro forma basis as though all the stores owned at december 31 2016  were under our control as of december 31 2015

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and are subject to various claims and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business because litigation is inherently unpredictable the outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined with any degree of certainty in accordance with applicable accounting guidance management establishes an accrued liability for litigation when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable in such cases there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued the estimated loss if any is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties therefore any estimates of loss disclosed below represents what management believes to be an estimate of loss only for certain matters meeting these criteria and does not represent our maximum loss exposure we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period notwithstanding the fact that we are currently vigorously defending any legal proceedings against us 

we currently have several legal proceedings pending against us that include causes of action alleging wrongful foreclosure violations of various state specific selfstorage statutes and violations of various consumer fraud acts as a result of these litigation matters we have recorded a liability of 56 million  which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report we make statements in this section that are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws for a complete discussion of forwardlooking statements see the section in this form 10k entitled “statements regarding forwardlooking information” certain risk factors may cause actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion for a discussion of such risk factors see the section in this form 10k entitled “risk factors” amounts in thousands except share and per share data 

overview 

we are a fully integrated selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust or reit formed to continue the business commenced in 1977 by extra space storage llc and its subsidiaries to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop professionally managed stores 

at december 31 2016  we owned had ownership interests in or managed 1427  operating stores in 38  states washington dc and puerto rico of these 1427  operating stores we owned 836  we held joint venture interests in 180  stores and our taxable reit subsidiary extra space management inc operated an additional 411  stores that are owned by third parties these operating stores contain approximately 107 million  square feet of rentable space in approximately 960000  units and currently serve a customer base of approximately 850000  tenants 

our stores are generally situated in convenient highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as atlanta baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas houston las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san franciscooakland these areas all enjoy above average population growth and income levels the clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale we consider a store to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization we consider a store to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 of the current year or has been open for three years prior to the january 1 of the current year 

to maximize the performance of our stores we employ industryleading revenue management systems developed by our management team these systems enable us to analyze set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions we believe our systems and processes allow us to more proactively manage revenues 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under leases at each of our whollyowned stores from management fees on the stores we manage for jointventure partners and unaffiliated third parties and from our tenant reinsurance program our management fee is generally equal to approximately 60 of cash collected from total revenues generated by the managed stores we also receive an asset management fee of 05 of the total asset value from one of our joint ventures 

we operate in competitive markets often where consumers have multiple stores from which to choose competition has impacted and will continue to impact our store results we experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity our operating results depend materially on our ability to lease available selfstorage units to actively manage unit rental rates and on the ability of our 

tenants to make required rental payments we believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the combination of our revenue management team and our industryleading technology systems 

we continue to evaluate a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to enable us to maximize stockholder value our strategies to maximize stockholder value include the following 

  



critical accounting policies and estimates 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those that impact our most critical accounting policies we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances a summary of significant accounting policies is also provided in 

the notes to our consolidated financial statements see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements actual results may differ from these estimates we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies 

consolidation  arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as variable interest entities “vies” an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it is the primary beneficiary of the vie 

a vie is created when i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii the entity’s equity holders as a group either a lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance b are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur or c do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur if an entity is deemed to be a vie the enterprise that is deemed to have a variable interest or combination of variable interests that provides the enterprise with a controlling financial interest in the vie is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 

we have concluded that under certain circumstances when we enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures a vie may be created under condition i or iib or iic of the previous paragraph for each vie created we have performed a qualitative analysis including considering which party if any has the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of each vie and whether that party has the obligation to absorb losses of the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could be significant to the vie if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie the assets liabilities and operations of the vie are consolidated with our financial statements as of december 31 2016  we had no consolidated vies additionally our operating partnership has notes payable to three trusts that are vies under condition iia above since the operating partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts these vies are not consolidated 

real estate assets  real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation direct and allowable internal costs associated with the development construction renovation and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized interest property taxes and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized 

expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives depreciation is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements which are generally between 5 and 39 years 

in connection with our acquisition of operating stores the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values which are estimated using significant unobservable inputs the value of the tangible assets consisting of land and buildings is determined as if vacant intangible assets which represent the value of existing tenant relationships are recorded at their fair values based on the avoided cost to replace the current leases we measure the value of tenant relationships based on the rent lost due to the amount of time required to replace existing customers which is based on our historical experience with turnover in our facilities debt assumed as part of an acquisition is recorded at fair value based on current interest rates compared to contractual rates acquisitionrelated transaction costs are expensed as incurred 

stores purchased at the time of certificate of occupancy issuance are considered asset acquisitions as such the purchase price is allocated to the land and buildings acquired based on their fair values any debt assumed as part of the acquisition is recorded at fair value based on current interest rates compared to contractual rates acquisitionrelated transactions costs are capitalized as part of the purchase price 

intangible lease rights include 1 purchase price amounts allocated to leases on three  stores that cannot be classified as ground or building leases these rights are amortized to expense over the term of the leases and 2 intangibles related to ground leases on eight  stores where the ground leases were assumed by us at rates that were different than the current market rates for similar leases the value associated with these assumed leases were recorded as intangibles which will be amortized over the lease terms 

evaluation of asset impairment  long lived assets held for use are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment we review each store at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist we focus on stores where occupancy andor rental income have decreased by a significant amount for these stores we determine whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the store will likely recover the lost occupancy andor revenue in the short term in addition we review stores in the leaseup stage and compare actual operating results to original projections 

when we determine that an event that may indicate impairment has occurred we compare the carrying value of the related longlived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets an impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the assets 

when real estate assets are identified as held for sale we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the fair value of the assets net of selling costs if the estimated fair value net of selling costs of the assets that have been identified as held for sale is less than the net carrying value of the assets we would recognize a loss on the disposal group classified as held for sale the operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are presented as part of normal operations for all periods presented 

investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures  our investments in real estate joint ventures where we have significant influence but not control and joint ventures which are vies in which we are not the primary beneficiary are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

under the equity method our investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures for the purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows we follow the “look through” approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures under this approach distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital eg a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint venture’s sale of assets in which case it is reported as an investing activity 

our management assesses annually whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired and when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment an investment is impaired if management’s estimate of the fair value of the investment using significant unobservable inputs is less than its carrying value to the extent impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment 

derivative instruments and hedging activities  the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk are considered fair value hedges derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges 

for derivatives designated as fair value hedges changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings 

revenue and expense recognition  rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants leases are generally on monthtomonth terms prepaid rents are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the leases promotional discounts are recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period late charges administrative fees merchandise sales and truck rentals are recognized in income when earned management fee revenues are recognized monthly as services are performed and in accordance with the terms of the related management agreements equity in earnings of real estate entities is recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate entities interest income is recognized as earned 

property expenses including utilities property taxes repairs and maintenance and other costs to manage the facilities are recognized as incurred we accrue for property tax expense based upon invoice amounts estimates and historical trends if these estimates are incorrect the timing of expense recognition could be affected 

tenant reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the period of insurance coverage we record an unpaid claims liability at the end of each period based on existing unpaid claims and historical claims payment history the unpaid claims liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost to settle all unpaid claims as of each period end including both reported but unpaid claims and claims that may have been incurred but have not been reported we use a third party claims administrator to adjust all tenant reinsurance claims received the administrator evaluates each claim to determine the ultimate claim loss and includes an estimate for claims that may have been incurred but not reported annually a third party actuary evaluates the adequacy of the unpaid claims liability prior year claim reserves are adjusted as experience develops or new information becomes known the impact of such adjustments is included in the current period operations the unpaid claims liability is not discounted to its present value each tenant chooses the amount of insurance coverage they want through the tenant reinsurance program tenants can purchase policies in amounts of two thousand dollars to ten thousand dollars of insurance coverage in exchange for a monthly fee our exposure per claim is limited by the maximum amount of coverage chosen by each tenant we purchase reinsurance for losses exceeding a set amount on any one event we do not currently have any amounts recoverable under the reinsurance arrangements 

income taxes  we have elected to be treated as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code in order to maintain our qualification as a reit among other things we are required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets as a reit we are not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to our stockholders we plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex if we were to fail to meet these requirements we would be subject to federal income tax we are subject to certain state and local taxes provision for such taxes has been included in income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

we have elected to treat one of our corporate subsidiaries extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary “trs” in general our trs may perform additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or nonreal estate related business a trs is subject to corporate federal income tax deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense when incurred

funds from operations 

ffo provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary along with net income and cash flows for an understanding of our operating results we believe ffo is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings net earnings assume that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses the values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and we believe ffo more accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts inc “nareit” as net income computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” excluding gains or losses on sales of operating stores and impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate assets plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis we believe that to further understand our performance ffo should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with gaap as presented in the consolidated financial statements ffo should not be considered a replacement of net income computed in accordance with gaap 

the computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions 

the following table presents the calculation of ffo for the periods indicated

 our indebtedness may be recourse nonrecourse crosscollateralized crossdefaulted secured or unsecured if the indebtedness is nonrecourse the collateral will be limited to the particular stores to which the indebtedness relates in addition we may invest in stores subject to existing loans collateralized by mortgages or similar liens on our stores or may refinance stores acquired on a leveraged basis we may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness to refinance investments including the redevelopment of existing stores for general working capital or to purchase additional interests in partnerships or joint ventures or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our future income cash flows and fair values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary and tax policies domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 44  billion in total face value debt of which approximately 13  billion was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 131  million annually 

interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur further in the event of a change of that magnitude we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure

we were formed to continue the business of extra space storage llc and its subsidiaries which had engaged in the selfstorage business since 1977 these companies were reorganized after the consummation of our ipo and various formation transactions as of december 31 2015 we held ownership interests in 999 operating stores of these operating stores 746 are whollyowned and 253 are owned in joint venture partnerships an additional 348 operating stores are owned by third parties and operated by us in exchange for a management fee bringing the total number of operating stores which we own andor manage to 1347 these operating stores are located in 36 states washington dc and puerto rico and contain approximately 101 million square feet of net rentable space in approximately 896000 units and currently serve a customer base of approximately 800000 tenants 

we operate in three distinct segments 1 rental operations 2 tenant reinsurance and 3 property management acquisition and development our rental operations activities include rental operations of stores in which we have an ownership interest tenant reinsurance activities include the reinsurance of risks relating to the loss of goods stored by tenants in the company’s stores our property management acquisition and development activities include managing acquiring developing and selling stores

acquisition of smartstop 

on october 1 2015 we completed the previously announced acquisition of smartstop self storage inc “smartstop” a public nontraded reit smartstop stockholders received 1375 per share in cash which represents a total purchase price of approximately 14 billion we paid approximately 13 billion and the remaining consideration came from the sale of certain assets by smartstop immediately prior to the closing as a result of the acquisition we acquired 122 stores and assumed the management of 43 stores previously managed by smartstop 

management 

members of our executive management team have significant experience in all aspects of the selfstorage industry having acquired andor developed a significant number of stores since before our ipo our executive management team and their years of industry experience are as follows spencer f kirk chief executive officer 18 years scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer 15 years samrat sondhi executive vice president and chief operating officer 12 years gwyn mcneal executive vice president and chief legal officer 10 years james overturf executive vice president and chief marketing officer 17 years joseph d margolis executive vice president and chief investment officer 10 years and kenneth m woolley executive chairman 35 years 

our executive management team and board of directors have a significant ownership position in the company with executive officers and directors owning approximately 4923970 shares or 39 of our outstanding common stock as of february 18 2016 

industry  competition 

stores offer monthtomonth storage space rental for personal or business use and are a costeffective and flexible storage alternative tenants rent fully enclosed spaces that can vary in size according to their specific needs and to which they have unlimited exclusive access tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units selfstorage unit sizes typically range from 5 feet by 5 feet to 20 feet by 20 feet with an interior height of 8 feet to 12 feet stores generally have onsite managers who supervise and run the daytoday operations providing tenants with assistance as needed 

selfstorage provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions due to life changes or simply because of a need for storage space the mix of residential tenants using a store is determined by a store’s local demographics and often includes people who are looking to downsize their living space or others who are not yet settled into a permanent residence items that residential tenants place in selfstorage range from cars boats and recreational vehicles to furniture household items and appliances commercial tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods records inventory or storage for seasonal goods 

our research has shown that tenants choose a store based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or business making highdensity hightraffic population centers ideal locations for stores a store’s perceived security and the general professionalism of the site managers and staff are also contributing factors to a 

 

site’s ability to successfully secure rentals although most stores are leased to tenants on a monthtomonth basis tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time 

the selfstorage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations a greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from may through september historically our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of july while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early march 

since inception in the early 1970’s the selfstorage industry has experienced significant growth the selfstorage industry has also seen increases in occupancy over the past several years according to the selfstorage almanac the “almanac” in 2008 the national average physical occupancy rate was 803 of net rentable square feet compared to an average physical occupancy rate of 902 in 2015 

we have encountered competition when we have sought to acquire stores especially for brokered portfolios aggressive bidding practices have been commonplace between both public and private entities and this competition will likely continue 

the industry is also characterized by fragmented ownership according to the almanac the top ten selfstorage companies in the united states owned approximately 174 of the total us stores and the top 50 selfstorage companies owned approximately 219 of the total us stores as of december 31 2015 we believe this fragmentation will contribute to continued consolidation at some level in the future we also believe that we are well positioned to compete for acquisitions given our historical reputation for closing deals 

we are the second largest selfstorage operator in the united states we are one of five public selfstorage reits along with cubesmart national storage affiliates sovran selfstorage inc and public storage inc 

longterm growth and investment strategies 

our primary business objectives are to maximize cash flow available for distribution to our stockholders and to achieve sustainable longterm growth in cash flow per share in order to maximize longterm stockholder value we continue to evaluate a range of growth initiatives and opportunities including the following 

 

  

  

  

financing of our longterm growth strategies 

acquisition and development financing 

the following table presents information on our lines of credit the “credit lines” for the periods indicated all of our credit lines are guaranteed by us and secured by mortgages on certain real estate assets amounts in thousands 

 

  

   we expect to maintain a flexible approach in financing new store acquisitions we plan to finance future acquisitions through a combination of cash borrowings under the credit lines traditional secured and unsecured mortgage financing joint ventures and additional debt or equity offerings 

joint venture financing 

we own 253 of our stores through joint ventures with third parties including affiliates of prudential financial inc in each joint venture we generally manage the daytoday operations of the underlying stores and have the right to participate in major decisions relating to sales of stores or financings by the applicable joint venture our joint venture partners typically provide most of the equity capital required for the operation of the respective business under the operating agreements for the joint ventures we maintain the right to receive between 20 and 967 of the available cash flow from operations after our joint venture partners and the company have received a predetermined return and between 170 and 967 of the available cash flow from capital transactions after our joint venture partners and the company have received a return of their capital plus such predetermined return most joint venture agreements include buysell rights as well as rights of first refusal in connection with the sale of stores by the joint venture 

disposition of stores 

we will continue to review our portfolio for stores or groups of stores that are underperforming or are not strategically located and determine whether to dispose of these stores to fund other growth as of december 31 2015 we had seven stores that were categorized as held for sale 

regulation 

generally stores are subject to various laws ordinances and regulations including regulations relating to lien sale rights and procedures changes in any of these laws or regulations as well as changes in laws such as the comprehensive environmental response and compensation liability act which increase the potential liability for environmental conditions or circumstances existing or created by tenants or others on stores or laws affecting development construction operation upkeep safety and taxation may result in significant 

 

unanticipated expenditures loss of stores or other impairments to operations which would adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

under the americans with disabilities act of 1990 the “ada” places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these requirements became effective in 1992 a number of additional us federal state and local laws also exist that may require modifications to the stores or restrict further renovations thereof with respect to access thereto by disabled persons noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature thereby requiring substantial capital expenditures to the extent our stores are not in compliance we are likely to incur additional costs to comply with the ada 

insurance activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state in accordance with the mccarranferguson act and are subject to the grammleachbliley act and the privacy regulations promulgated by the federal trade commission pursuant thereto 

store management activities are often subject to state real estate brokerage laws and regulations as determined by the particular real estate commission for each state 

changes in any of the laws governing our conduct could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business or could materially affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

employees 

as of february 18 2016 we had 3209 employees and believe our relationship with our employees is good our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement 

 

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend an investment in our securities involves various risks all investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information contained in this annual report before trading in our securities if any of the events set forth in the following risks actually occur our business operating results prospects and financial condition could be harmed 

our performance is subject to risks associated with real estate investments we are a real estate company that derives our income from operation of our stores there are a number of factors that may adversely affect the income that our stores generate including the following 

risks related to our stores and operations 

adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating results 

our operating results are dependent upon our ability to maximize occupancy levels and rental rates in our stores adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we operate may lower our occupancy levels and limit our ability to increase rents or require us to offer rental discounts if our stores fail to generate revenues sufficient to meet our cash requirements including operating and other expenses debt service and capital expenditures our net income funds from operations “ffo” cash flow financial condition ability to make cash distributions to stockholders and the trading price of our securities could be adversely affected the following factors among others may adversely affect the operating performance of our stores 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if we are unable to promptly relet our units or if the rates upon such reletting are significantly lower than expected our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

virtually all of our leases are on a monthtomonth basis any delay in reletting units as vacancies arise would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results in addition lower than expected rental rates upon reletting could adversely affect our revenues and impede our growth 

we depend upon our onsite personnel to maximize tenant satisfaction at each of our stores and any difficulties we encounter in hiring training and maintaining skilled field personnel may harm our operating performance 

we had 2716 field personnel as of february 18 2016 in the management and operation of our stores the general professionalism of our store managers and staff are contributing factors to a store’s ability to successfully secure rentals and retain tenants we also rely upon our field personnel to maintain clean and secure stores if we are unable to successfully recruit train and retain qualified field personnel the quality of service we strive to provide at our stores could be adversely affected which could lead to decreased occupancy levels and reduced operating performance 

uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flow 

we maintain comprehensive liability fire flood earthquake wind as deemed necessary or as required by our lenders extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our stores certain types of losses however may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable such as losses due to earthquakes hurricanes tornadoes riots acts of war or terrorism should an uninsured loss occur we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a store in addition if any such loss is insured we may be required to pay significant amounts on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to our insurer being obligated to reimburse us for the loss or the amount of the loss may exceed our coverage for the loss as a result our operating results may be adversely affected 

increases in taxes and regulatory compliance costs may reduce our income 

costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws generally are not passed through to tenants directly and will affect us increases in income property or other taxes generally are not passed through to tenants under 

 

leases and may reduce our net income ffo cash flow financial condition ability to pay or refinance our debt obligations ability to make cash distributions to stockholders and the trading price of our securities similarly changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on stores or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which could similarly adversely affect our business and results of operations 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our stores may affect our results of operations 

under various us federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations owners and operators of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigating and remediating certain hazardous substances or other regulated materials on or in such property such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such substances or materials the presence of such substances or materials or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s or operator’s ability to lease sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances or other regulated materials may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials into the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real stores for personal injury associated with asbestoscontaining materials 

certain environmental laws also impose liability without regard to knowledge or fault for removal or remediation of hazardous substances or other regulated materials upon owners and operators of contaminated property even after they no longer own or operate the property moreover the past or present owner or operator from which a release emanates could be liable for any personal injuries or property damages that may result from such releases as well as any damages to natural resources that may arise from such releases 

certain environmental laws impose compliance obligations on owners and operators of real property with respect to the management of hazardous materials and other regulated substances for example environmental laws govern the management of asbestoscontaining materials and leadbased paint failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties or other sanctions 

no assurances can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of our stores reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner or operator of our stores did not create any material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our stores there also exists the risk that material environmental conditions liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future finally future laws ordinances or regulations and future interpretations of existing laws ordinances or regulations may impose additional material environmental liability 

costs associated with complying with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 may result in unanticipated expenses 

under the ada places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these requirements became effective in 1992 a number of additional us federal state and local laws may also require modifications to our stores or restrict certain further renovations of the stores with respect to access thereto by disabled persons noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature which could result in substantial capital expenditures we have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our stores to determine our compliance and we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with the ada or other legislation if one or more of our stores is not in compliance with the ada or other legislation then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the facility into compliance if 

 

we incur substantial costs to comply with the ada or other legislation our financial condition results of operations cash flow per share trading price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make cash distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected 

our tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation which may adversely affect our results 

our tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation the regulatory authorities generally have broad discretion to grant renew and revoke licenses and approvals to promulgate interpret and implement regulations and to evaluate compliance with regulations through periodic examinations audits and investigations of the affairs of insurance providers as a result of regulatory or private action in any jurisdiction we may be temporarily or permanently suspended from continuing some or all of our reinsurance activities or otherwise fined or penalized or suffer an adverse judgment which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we face competition for the acquisition of stores and other assets which may impede our ability to make future acquisitions or may increase the cost of these acquisitions 

we compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of stores and other assets including national regional and local operators and developers of stores these competitors may drive up the price we pay for stores or other assets we seek to acquire or may succeed in acquiring those stores or assets themselves in addition our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive suitors because they may have greater resources may be willing to pay more or may have a more compatible operating philosophy in addition the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment in stores may increase this competition would result in increased demand for these assets and therefore increased prices paid for them because of an increased interest in singlestore acquisitions among taxmotivated individual purchasers we may pay higher prices if we purchase single stores in comparison with portfolio acquisitions if we pay higher prices for stores or other assets our profitability will be reduced 

we may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria which may impede our growth 

our ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy we may not be successful in identifying suitable stores or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms or at all failure to identify or consummate acquisitions will slow our growth which could in turn adversely affect our stock price 

our ability to acquire stores on favorable terms and successfully integrate and operate them may be constrained by the following significant risks 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition strategic decisions by us such as acquisitions may adversely affect the price of our securities 

we may not be successful in integrating and operating acquired stores 

we have acquired many stores in the past and we expect to continue acquiring stores in the future if we acquire any stores we will be required to integrate them into our existing portfolio the acquired stores may turn out to be less compatible with our growth strategy than originally anticipated may cause disruptions in our operations or may divert management’s attention away from daytoday operations which could impair our operating results as a whole 

we do not always obtain independent appraisals of our stores and thus the consideration paid for these stores may exceed the value that may be indicated by thirdparty appraisals 

we do not always obtain thirdparty appraisals in connection with our acquisition of stores and the consideration being paid by us in exchange for those stores may exceed the value determined by thirdparty appraisals in such cases the value of the stores was determined by our senior management team 

our investments in development and redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns which would harm our operating results and reduce the amount of funds available for distributions 

to the extent that we engage in development and redevelopment activities we will be subject to the following risks normally associated with these projects 

 

  

  

  

 in deciding whether to develop or redevelop a particular property we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of the store we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring the property up to the standards established for its intended market position or may be unable to increase occupancy at a newly developed store as quickly as expected or at all any substantial unanticipated delays or expenses could adversely affect the investment returns from these development or redevelopment projects and harm our operating results liquidity and financial condition which could result in a decline in the value of our securities 

we may rely on the investments of our joint venture partners for funding certain of our development and redevelopment projects if our reputation in the selfstorage industry changes or the number of investors considering us an attractive strategic partner is otherwise reduced our ability to develop or redevelop stores could be affected which would limit our growth 

we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes including financial 

 

transactions and records personally identifiable information and tenant and lease data we purchase some of our information technology from vendors on whom our systems depend we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential tenant and other sensitive information although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems it is possible that our safety and security measures will not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning or damage or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyberattacks security breaches including physical or electronic breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar breaches can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information while to date we have not experienced a security breach this risk has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication of such breaches and attempted breaches from around the world have increased any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation divert significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

risks related to our organization and structure 

our business could be harmed if key personnel with longstanding business relationships in the selfstorage industry terminate their employment with us 

our success depends on the continued services of members of our executive management team who have substantial experience in the selfstorage industry in addition our ability to acquire or develop stores in the future depends on the significant relationships our executive management team has developed with our institutional joint venture partners such as affiliates of prudential financial inc there is no guarantee that any of them will remain employed by us we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers the loss of services of one or more members of our executive management team could harm our business and our prospects 

we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business without stockholder consent which may subject us to different risks 

we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business at any time without the consent of our stockholders which could result in our making investments and engaging in business activities that are different from and possibly riskier than the investments and businesses described in this document a change in our investment strategy or our entry into new lines of business may increase our exposure to other risks or real estate market fluctuations 

if other selfstorage companies convert to an upreit structure or if tax laws change we may no longer have an advantage in competing for potential acquisitions 

because we are structured as an upreit we are a more attractive acquirer of stores to taxmotivated sellers than our competitors that are not structured as upreits however if other selfstorage companies restructure their holdings to become upreits this competitive advantage will disappear in addition new legislation may be enacted or new interpretations of existing legislation may be issued by the internal revenue service “irs” or the us treasury department that could affect the attractiveness of our upreit structure so that it may no longer assist us in competing for acquisitions 

tax indemnification obligations may require the operating partnership to maintain certain debt levels 

we have provided certain tax protections to various third parties in connection with their property contributions to the operating partnership upon acquisition by the company including making available the opportunity to 1 guarantee debt or 2 enter into a special loss allocation and deficit restoration obligation we have agreed to these provisions in order to assist these contributors in preserving their tax position after their contributions these obligations may require us to maintain certain indebtedness levels that we would not otherwise require for our business 

 

our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority 

as of december 31 2015 we held interests in 253 operating stores through joint ventures some of these arrangements could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority our reliance on coventurers financial conditions and disputes between us and our coventurers we expect to continue our joint venture strategy by entering into more joint ventures for the purpose of developing new stores and acquiring existing stores in such event we would not be in a position to exercise sole decisionmaking authority regarding the property partnership joint venture or other entity the decisionmaking authority regarding the stores we currently hold through joint ventures is either vested exclusively with our joint venture partners is subject to a majority vote of the joint venture partners or equally shared by us and the joint venture partners in addition investments in partnerships joint ventures or other entities may under certain circumstances involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or coventurers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions partners or coventurers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions such as a sale because neither we nor the partner or coventurer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or coventurers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers andor directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or coventurers might result in subjecting stores owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our thirdparty partners or coventurers which could harm our financial condition 

conflicts of interest could arise as a result of our relationship with our operating partnership 

conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates and our operating partnership or any partner thereof our directors and officers have duties to our company under applicable maryland law in connection with their management of our company at the same time we through our whollyowned subsidiary have fiduciary duties as a general partner to our operating partnership and to the limited partners under delaware law in connection with the management of our operating partnership our duties through our whollyowned subsidiary as a general partner to our operating partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our company the partnership agreement of our operating partnership does not require us to resolve such conflicts in favor of either our company or the limited partners in our operating partnership unless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement delaware law generally requires a general partner of a delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith fairness and loyalty and which generally prohibit such general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest 

additionally the partnership agreement expressly limits our liability by providing that neither we our direct whollyowned massachusetts business trust subsidiary as the general partner of the operating partnership nor any of our or their trustees directors or officers will be liable or accountable in damages to our operating partnership the limited partners or assignees for errors in judgment mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if we or such trustee director or officer acted in good faith in addition our operating partnership is required to indemnify us our affiliates and each of our respective trustees officers directors employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against any and all losses claims damages liabilities whether joint or several expenses including without limitation attorneys’ fees and other legal fees and expenses judgments fines settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims demands actions suits or proceedings civil criminal administrative or investigative that relate to the operations of the operating partnership provided that our operating partnership will not indemnify for 1 willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law 2 any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement or 3 in the case of a criminal proceeding the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful 

 

the provisions of delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement 

certain provisions of maryland law and our organizational documents including the stock ownership limit imposed by our charter may inhibit market activity in our stock and could prevent or delay a change in control transaction 

our charter subject to certain exceptions authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a reit and to limit any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding common stock or 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limit however our board of directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership limit to any proposed transferee whose ownership could jeopardize our qualification as a reit these restrictions on ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the ownership limit may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders different ownership limits apply to the family of kenneth m woolley certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing to spencer f kirk certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and to certain designated investment entities as defined in our charter 

our board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder approval in addition our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares our board of directors could issue additional shares of our common stock or establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise not be in the best interests of our stockholders 

our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited 

maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances in addition our charter eliminates our directors’ and officers’ liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law as a result we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law in addition we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers 

to the extent our distributions represent a return of capital for us federal income tax purposes our stockholders could recognize an increased capital gain upon a subsequent sale of common stock 

distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and not treated by us as a dividend will not be taxable to a us stockholder under current us federal income tax law to the extent those 

 

distributions do not exceed the stockholder’s adjusted tax basis in his her or its common stock but instead will constitute a return of capital and will reduce such adjusted basis if distributions result in a reduction of a stockholder’s adjusted basis in such holder’s common stock subsequent sales of such holder’s common stock will result in recognition of an increased capital gain or decreased capital loss due to the reduction in such adjusted basis 

risks related to the real estate industry 

our primary business involves the ownership and operation of stores 

our current strategy is to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop only stores consequently we are subject to risks inherent in investments in a single industry because investments in real estate are inherently illiquid this strategy makes it difficult for us to diversify our investment portfolio and to limit our risk when economic conditions change decreases in market rents negative tax real estate and zoning law changes and changes in environmental protection laws may also increase our costs lower the value of our investments and decrease our income which would adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our stores 

because real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to promptly sell one or more stores in our portfolio in response to changing economic financial and investment conditions is limited the real estate market is affected by many factors such as general economic conditions availability of financing interest rates and other factors including supply and demand that are beyond our control we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any store for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a store 

we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a store can be sold we cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements in acquiring a store we may agree to transfer restrictions that materially restrict us from selling that store for a period of time or impose other restrictions such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that store these transfer restrictions would impede our ability to sell a store even if we deem it necessary or appropriate 

any investments in unimproved real property may take significantly longer to yield incomeproducing returns if at all and may result in additional costs to us to comply with rezoning restrictions or environmental regulations 

we have invested in the past and may invest in the future in unimproved real property unimproved properties generally take longer to yield incomeproducing returns based on the typical time required for development any development of unimproved property may also expose us to the risks and uncertainties associated with rezoning the land for a higher use or development and environmental concerns of governmental entities andor community groups any unsuccessful investments or delays in realizing an incomeproducing return or increased costs to develop unimproved real estate could restrict our ability to earn our targeted rate of return on an investment or adversely affect our ability to pay operating expenses which would harm our financial condition and operating results 

any negative perceptions of the selfstorage industry generally may result in a decline in our stock price 

to the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the selfstorage industry the value of our securities may be negatively impacted which could result in our securities trading below the inherent value of our assets 

 

risks related to our debt financings 

disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us 

uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to refinance existing debt maturities on favorable terms or at all which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions and fund development projects a downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell stores or may adversely affect the price we receive for stores that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing 

required payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our stores or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations 

as of december 31 2015 we had approximately 36 billion of outstanding indebtedness we may incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions and development we may borrow under our credit lines or borrow new funds to finance these future stores additionally we do not anticipate that our internally generated cash flow will be adequate to repay our existing indebtedness upon maturity and therefore we expect to repay our indebtedness through refinancings and equity andor debt offerings further we may need to borrow funds in order to make cash distributions to maintain our qualification as a reit or to make our expected distributions 

if we are required to utilize our credit lines for purposes other than acquisition activity this will reduce the amount available for acquisitions and could slow our growth therefore our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and make cash distributions to our stockholders 

as of december 31 2015 we had approximately 36 billion of debt outstanding of which approximately 11 billion or 314 was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps this variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 21 per annum increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase our interest expense which could harm our cash flow and our ability to pay cash distributions for example if market rates of interest on this variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points excluding variable rate debt with interest rate floors the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 73 million annually 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations 

in certain cases we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements hedging involves risks such as the risk that the counterparty may fail to honor its obligations under an arrangement failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders 

risks related to qualification and operation as a reit 

to maintain our qualification as a reit we may be forced to borrow funds on a shortterm basis during unfavorable market conditions 

to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our net taxable income each year excluding net capital gains and we are subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income each year in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions made by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years while historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances its own stock assuming we continue to satisfy these distributions requirements with cash we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis or possibly longterm to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these borrowing needs could result from a difference in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for us federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt amortization payments 

dividends payable by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates 

the maximum us federal income tax rate for dividends paid by domestic corporations to individual us stockholders is 20 dividends paid by reits however are generally not eligible for the reduced rates the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause stockholders who are individuals to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits including our securities 

in addition the relative attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends which could negatively affect the value of our stores 

possible legislative or other actions affecting reits could adversely affect our stockholders 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us treasury department changes to tax laws which changes may 

 

have retroactive application could adversely affect our stockholders it cannot be predicted whether when in what forms or with what effective dates the tax laws applicable to us or our stockholders will be changed 

the power of our board of directors to revoke our reit election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders 

our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election without the approval of our stockholders if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a reit if we cease to qualify as a reit we would become subject to us federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our net taxable income to our stockholders which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholders 

our failure to qualify as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock 

we believe we operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit or lose our qualification as a reit at any time we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution for each of the years involved because 

 

  

  

 in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits this means that our us individual stockholders would be taxed on our dividends at capital gains rates and our us corporate stockholders would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends subject in each case to applicable limitations under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and are able to avail ourselves of one or more of the relief provisions under the internal revenue code in order to maintain our reit status we may nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of 50000 or more for each such failure as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our securities 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the internal revenue code is greater in the case of a reit that like us holds its assets through a partnership the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the composition of our assets the sources of our gross income and the owners of our stock our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market value of our assets some of which are not susceptible to precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our net taxable income excluding capital gains and we will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income including capital gains in addition legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors our ability to qualify as a reit for us 

 

federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that is intended to allow us to qualify for taxation as a reit we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the internal revenue service regarding our qualification as a reit 

we will pay some taxes 

even though we qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we will be required to pay some us federal state and local taxes on our income and property extra space management inc manages stores for our joint ventures and stores owned by third parties we jointly with extra space management inc elected to treat extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary “trs” of our company for us federal income tax purposes a taxable reit subsidiary is a fully taxable corporation and may be limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to us esm reinsurance limited a whollyowned subsidiary of extra space management inc generates income from insurance premiums that are subject to federal income tax and state insurance premiums tax in addition we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements among our tenants our taxable reit subsidiary and us are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties or if we receive payments for inventory or property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business also if we sell property as a dealer ie to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on any gain arising from such sales while we don’t intend to sell stores as a dealer the irs could take a contrary position to the extent that we are or our taxable reit subsidiary is required to pay us federal state or local taxes we will have less cash available for distribution to stockholders 

complying with reit requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 

to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the nature and diversification of our assets the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock in order to meet these tests we may be required to forego attractive business or investment opportunities thus compliance with the reit requirements may adversely affect our ability to operate solely to maximize profits

 item 2 properties tableend as of december 31 2015 we owned or had ownership interests in 999 operating stores of these stores 746 are whollyowned and 253 are held in joint ventures in addition we managed an additional 348 stores for third parties bringing the total number of stores which we own andor manage to 1347 these stores are located in 36 states washington dc and puerto rico we receive a management fee generally equal to approximately 60 of cash collected from total revenues to manage the joint venture and third party sites as of december 31 2015 we owned andor managed approximately 101 million square feet of rentable space configured in approximately 896000 separate storage units approximately 70 of our stores are clustered around large population centers such as atlanta baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas houston las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san franciscooakland these markets contain aboveaverage population and income demographics for stores the clustering of assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale our acquisitions have given us an increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in many markets where we had no previous presence 

we consider a store to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization we consider a store to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 or has been open for three years 

 

as of december 31 2015 approximately 800000 tenants were leasing storage units at the 1347 operating stores that we own andor manage primarily on a monthtomonth basis providing the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit existing tenants generally receive rate increases at least annually for which no direct correlation has been drawn to our vacancy trends although leases are shortterm in duration the typical tenant tends to remain at our stores for an extended period of time for stores that were stabilized as of december 31 2015 the average length of stay was approximately 137 months 

the average annual rent per square foot for our existing customers at stabilized stores net of discounts and bad debt was 1483 for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 1402 for the year ended december 31 2014 average annual rent per square foot for new leases was 1541 for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 1435 for the year ended december 31 2014 the average discounts as a percentage of rental revenues during these periods were 33 and 38 respectively 

our store portfolio is made up of different types of construction and building configurations depending on the site and the municipality where it is located most often sites are what we consider “hybrid” facilities a mix of both driveup buildings and multifloor buildings we have a number of multifloor buildings with elevator access only and a number of facilities featuring groundfloor access only 

the following table presents additional information regarding the occupancy of our stabilized stores by state as of december 31 2015 and 2014 the information as of december 31 2014 is on a pro forma basis as though all the stores owned at december 31 2015 were under our control as of december 31 2014

overview 

we are a fully integrated selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust or reit formed to continue the business commenced in 1977 by extra space storage llc and its subsidiaries to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop professionally managed stores 

at december 31 2015 we owned had ownership interests in or managed 1347 operating stores in 36 states washington dc and puerto rico of these 1347 operating stores we owned 746 we held joint venture interests in 253 stores and our taxable reit subsidiary extra space management inc operated an additional 348 stores that are owned by third parties these operating stores contain approximately 101 million square feet of rentable space in approximately 896000 units and currently serve a customer base of approximately 800000 tenants 

our stores are generally situated in convenient highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as atlanta baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas houston las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san franciscooakland these areas all enjoy above average population growth and income levels the clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale we consider a store to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization a store is considered to be stabilized once it has achieved an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 or has been open for three years 

to maximize the performance of our stores we employ industryleading revenue management systems developed by our management team these systems enable us to analyze set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions we believe our systems and processes allow us to more proactively manage revenues 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under leases at each of our whollyowned stores from management fees on the stores we manage for jointventure partners and unaffiliated third parties and from our tenant reinsurance program our management fee is generally equal to approximately 60 of cash collected from total revenues generated by the managed stores we also receive an asset management fee of 05 of the total asset value from one of our joint ventures 

we operate in competitive markets often where consumers have multiple stores from which to choose competition has impacted and will continue to impact our store results we experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity our operating results depend materially on our ability to lease available selfstorage units to actively manage unit rental rates and on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments we believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the combination of our revenue management team and our industryleading technology systems 

 

we continue to evaluate a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to enable us to maximize stockholder value our strategies to maximize stockholder value include the following 

 

  

  

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those that impact our most critical accounting policies we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies 

consolidation arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as variable interest entities “vies” an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it is the primary beneficiary of the vie 

a vie is created when i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii the entity’s equity holders as a group either a lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance b are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur or c do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur if an entity is deemed to be a vie the enterprise that is deemed to have a variable interest or combination of variable interests that provides the enterprise with a controlling financial interest in the vie is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 

we have concluded that under certain circumstances when we enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures a vie may be created under condition i ii b or c of the previous paragraph for each vie created we have performed a qualitative analysis including considering which party if any has the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of each vie and whether that party has the 

 

obligation to absorb losses of the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could be significant to the vie if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie the assets liabilities and operations of the vie are consolidated with our financial statements as of december 31 2015 we had no consolidated vies additionally our operating partnership has notes payable to three trusts that are vies under condition iia above since the operating partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts these vies are not consolidated 

real estate assets real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation direct and allowable internal costs associated with the development construction renovation and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized interest property taxes and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized 

expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives depreciation is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements which are generally between 5 and 39 years 

in connection with our acquisition of stores the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values which are estimated using significant unobservable inputs the value of the tangible assets consisting of land and buildings is determined as if vacant intangible assets which represent the value of existing tenant relationships are recorded at their fair values based on the avoided cost to replace the current leases we measure the value of tenant relationships based on the rent lost due to the amount of time required to replace existing customers which is based on our historical experience with turnover in our facilities debt assumed as part of an acquisition is recorded at fair value based on current interest rates compared to contractual rates acquisitionrelated transaction costs are expensed as incurred 

intangible lease rights include 1 purchase price amounts allocated to leases on three stores that cannot be classified as ground or building leases these rights are amortized to expense over the term of the leases and 2 intangibles related to ground leases on six stores where the ground leases were assumed by the company at rates that were different than the current market rates for similar leases the value associated with these assumed leases were recorded as intangibles which will be amortized over the lease terms 

evaluation of asset impairment long lived assets held for use are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment we review each store at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist we focus on stores where occupancy andor rental income have decreased by a significant amount for these stores we determine whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the store will likely recover the lost occupancy andor revenue in the short term in addition we review stores in the leaseup stage and compare actual operating results to original projections 

when we determine that an event that may indicate impairment has occurred we compare the carrying value of the related longlived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets an impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the assets 

when real estate assets are identified as held for sale we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the fair value of the assets net of selling costs if the estimated fair value net of selling costs of the assets that have been identified as held for sale is less than the net carrying value of the assets we would recognize a loss on the disposal group classified as held for sale the operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are presented as part of normal operations for all periods presented 

 

investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures our investments in real estate joint ventures where we have significant influence but not control and joint ventures which are vies in which we are not the primary beneficiary are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

under the equity method our investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures for the purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows we follow the “look through” approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures under this approach distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital eg a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint venture’s sale of assets in which case it is reported as an investing activity 

our management assesses annually whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired and when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment an investment is impaired if management’s estimate of the fair value of the investment using significant unobservable inputs is less than its carrying value to the extent impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment 

derivative instruments and hedging activities the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk are considered fair value hedges derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges 

for derivatives designated as fair value hedges changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings 

revenue and expense recognition rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants leases are generally on monthtomonth terms prepaid rents are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the leases promotional discounts are recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period late charges administrative fees merchandise sales and truck rentals are recognized in income when earned management fee revenues are recognized monthly as services are performed and in accordance with the terms of the related management agreements equity in earnings of real estate entities is recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate entities interest income is recognized as earned 

property expenses including utilities property taxes repairs and maintenance and other costs to manage the facilities are recognized as incurred we accrue for property tax expense based upon invoice amounts estimates and historical trends if these estimates are incorrect the timing of expense recognition could be affected 

tenant reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the period of insurance coverage we record an unpaid claims liability at the end of each period based on existing unpaid claims and historical claims payment history the unpaid claims liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost to settle all unpaid claims as of each period end including both reported but unpaid claims and claims that may have been incurred but have not been reported we use a third party claims administrator to adjust all tenant reinsurance claims received the administrator evaluates each claim to determine the ultimate claim loss and includes an estimate for claims that may have been incurred but not reported annually a third party actuary evaluates the adequacy of the unpaid

funds from operations 

ffo provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary along with net income and cash flows for an understanding of our operating results we believe ffo is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings net earnings assume that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses the values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and we believe ffo more accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts inc “nareit” as net income computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” excluding gains or losses on sales of operating stores and impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate assets plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis we believe that to further understand our performance ffo should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with gaap as presented in the consolidated financial statements 

the computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions 

the following table presents the calculation of ffo for the periods indicated 

 

 samestore results 

we consider our samestore portfolio to consist of only those stores which were whollyowned at the beginning and at the end of the applicable periods presented that had achieved stabilization as of the first day of 

 

such period the following tables present operating data for our samestore portfolio we consider the following samestore presentation to be meaningful in regards to the stores shown below because these results provide information relating to store level operating changes without the effects of acquisitions or completed developments 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2015 to the year ended december 31 2014

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2015 we had 75799 available in cash and cash equivalents we intend to use this cash for acquisitions to repay debt scheduled to mature in 2015 and for general corporate purposes we are required to distribute at least 90 of our net taxable income excluding net capital gains to our stockholders on an annual basis to maintain our qualification as a reit 

our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts during 2015 we experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash or cash equivalents however there can be no assurance that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 

the following table presents information on our lines of credit for the period presented all of our lines of credit are guaranteed by us and secured by mortgages on certain real estate assets 

 

  

   as of december 31 2015 we had 3598254 face value of debt resulting in a debt to total capitalization ratio of 232 as of december 31 2015 the ratio of total fixed rate debt and other instruments to total debt was 686 including 1527386 on which we have interest rate swaps that have been included as fixedrate debt the weighted average interest rate of the total of fixed and variable rate debt at december 31 2015 was 31 certain of our real estate assets are pledged as collateral for our debt we are subject to certain restrictive covenants relating to our outstanding debt we were in compliance with all financial covenants at december 31 2015 

we expect to fund our shortterm liquidity requirements including operating expenses recurring capital expenditures dividends to stockholders distributions to holders of op units and interest on our outstanding indebtedness out of our operating cash flow cash on hand and borrowings under our credit lines in addition we are pursuing additional term loans secured by unencumbered stores 

our liquidity needs consist primarily of cash distributions to stockholders store acquisitions principal payments under our borrowings and nonrecurring capital expenditures we may from time to time seek to repurchase our outstanding debt shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors in addition we evaluate on an ongoing basis the merits of strategic acquisitions and other relationships which may require us to raise additional funds we do not expect that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs and instead expect to fund such needs out of additional borrowings of secured or unsecured indebtedness joint ventures with third parties and from the proceeds of public and private offerings of equity and debt additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all any additional issuance of equity or equitylinked securities may result in dilution to our stockholders in addition any new securities we issue could have rights preferences and 

 

privileges senior to holders of our common stock we may also use op units as currency to fund acquisitions from selfstorage owners who desire taxdeferral in their exiting transactions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes further except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitments or intent to provide funding to any such entities accordingly we are not materially exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 

contractual obligations 

the following table presents information on future payments due by period as of december 31 2015 

 

 the operating leases above include minimum future lease payments on leases for 19 of our operating stores as well as leases of our corporate offices two ground leases include additional contingent rental payments based on the level of revenue achieved at the store 

as of december 31 2015 the weighted average interest rate for all fixed rate loans was 36 and the weighted average interest rate on all variable rate loans was 21 

financing strategy 

we will continue to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts reviewed from time to time by our board of directors although our board of directors has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur we will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or variable rate in making financing decisions we will consider factors including but not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our indebtedness may be recourse nonrecourse or crosscollateralized if the indebtedness is nonrecourse the collateral will be limited to the particular stores to which the indebtedness relates in addition we may invest in stores subject to existing loans collateralized by mortgages or similar liens on our stores or may refinance stores acquired on a leveraged basis we may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness to refinance investments including the redevelopment of existing stores for general working capital or to purchase additional interests in partnerships or joint ventures or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable 

we may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt as well as shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

seasonality 

the selfstorage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations a greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from may through september historically our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of july while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early march results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk 

market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our future income cash flows and fair values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary and tax policies domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2015 we had approximately 36 billion in total face value debt of which approximately 11 billion was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt excluding variable rate debt with interest rate floors would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 73 million annually 

interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur further in the event of a change of that magnitude we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure

management 

members of our executive management team have significant experience in all aspects of the selfstorage industry having acquired andor developed a significant number of stores since before our ipo our executive management team and their years of industry experience are as follows spencer f kirk chief executive officer 17 years scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer 14 years samrat sondhi executive vice president of operations 11 years gwyn mcneal executive vice president and chief legal officer 9 years james overturf executive vice president and chief marketing officer 16 years charles l allen executive vice president and chief investment officer 17 years and kenneth m woolley executive chairman 34 years 

our executive management team and board of directors have a significant ownership position in the company with executive officers and directors owning approximately 5297354 shares or 46 of our outstanding common stock as of february 18 2015 

industry  competition 

selfstorage stores offer monthtomonth storage space rental for personal or business use and are a costeffective and flexible storage alternative tenants rent fully enclosed spaces that can vary in size according to their specific needs and to which they have unlimited exclusive access tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units selfstorage unit sizes typically range from 5 feet by 5 feet to 20 feet by 20 feet with an interior height of 8 feet to 12 feet stores generally have onsite managers who supervise and run the daytoday operations providing tenants with assistance as needed 

selfstorage provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions due to life changes or simply because of a need for storage space the mix of residential tenants using a store is determined by a store’s local demographics and often includes people who are looking to downsize their living space or others who are not yet settled into a permanent residence items that residential tenants place in selfstorage range from cars boats and recreational vehicles to furniture household items and appliances commercial tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods records inventory or storage for seasonal goods 

our research has shown that tenants choose a store based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or business making highdensity hightraffic population centers ideal locations for stores a selfstorage store’s perceived security and the general professionalism of the site managers and staff are also contributing factors to a site’s ability to successfully secure rentals although most stores are leased to tenants on a monthtomonth basis tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time 

the selfstorage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations a greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from may through september historically our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of july while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early march 

since inception in the early 1970’s the selfstorage industry has experienced significant growth according to the selfstorage almanac the “almanac” in 2008 there were only 41100 stores in the united states with an average physical occupancy rate of 830 of net rentable square feet compared to 51475 stores in 2014 with an average physical occupancy rate of 891 of net rentable square feet 

we have encountered competition when we have sought to acquire stores especially for brokered portfolios aggressive bidding practices have been commonplace between both public and private entities and this competition will likely continue 

the industry is also characterized by fragmented ownership according to the almanac the top ten selfstorage companies in the united states owned approximately 131 of the total us selfstorage stores and the top 50 selfstorage companies owned approximately 171 of the total us selfstorage stores as of 

 

december 31 2014 we believe this fragmentation will contribute to continued consolidation at some level in the future we also believe that we are well positioned to compete for acquisitions given our historical reputation for closing deals 

we are the second largest selfstorage operator in the united states we are one of four public selfstorage reits along with public storage inc cubesmart and sovran selfstorage inc 

longterm growth and investment strategies 

our primary business objectives are to maximize cash flow available for distribution to our stockholders and to achieve sustainable longterm growth in cash flow per share in order to maximize longterm stockholder value we continue to evaluate a range of growth initiatives and opportunities including the following 

 

  

  

 financing of our longterm growth strategies 

acquisition and development financing 

the following table presents information on our lines of credit the “credit lines” for the periods indicated all of our credit lines are guaranteed by us and secured by mortgages on certain real estate assets 

 

  

     

we expect to maintain a flexible approach in financing new selfstorage store acquisitions we plan to finance future acquisitions through a combination of cash borrowings under the credit lines traditional secured mortgage financing joint ventures and additional equity offerings 

joint venture financing 

we own 271 of our stores through joint ventures with third parties including affiliates of prudential financial inc in each joint venture we generally manage the daytoday operations of the underlying stores and have the right to participate in major decisions relating to sales of stores or financings by the applicable joint venture our joint venture partners typically provide most of the equity capital required for the operation of the respective business under the operating agreements for the joint ventures we maintain the right to receive between 20 and 990 of the available cash flow from operations after our joint venture partners and the company have received a predetermined return and between 170 and 990 of the available cash flow from capital transactions after our joint venture partners and the company have received a return of their capital plus such predetermined return most joint venture agreements include buysell rights as well as rights of first refusal in connection with the sale of stores by the joint venture 

disposition of selfstorage stores 

we will continue to review our portfolio for stores or groups of stores that are underperforming or are not strategically located and determine whether to dispose of these stores to fund other growth 

regulation 

generally stores are subject to various laws ordinances and regulations including regulations relating to lien sale rights and procedures changes in any of these laws or regulations as well as changes in laws such as the comprehensive environmental response and compensation liability act which increase the potential liability for environmental conditions or circumstances existing or created by tenants or others on stores or laws affecting development construction operation upkeep safety and taxation may result in significant unanticipated expenditures loss of selfstorage stores or other impairments to operations which would adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

under the americans with disabilities act of 1990 the “ada” places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these requirements became effective in 1992 a number of additional us federal state and local laws also exist that may require modifications to the stores or restrict further renovations thereof with respect to access thereto by disabled persons noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature thereby requiring substantial capital expenditures to the extent our stores are not in compliance we are likely to incur additional costs to comply with the ada 

insurance activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state in accordance with the mccarranferguson act and are subject to the grammleachbliley act and the privacy regulations promulgated by the federal trade commission pursuant thereto 

store management activities are often subject to state real estate brokerage laws and regulations as determined by the particular real estate commission for each state 

changes in any of the laws governing our conduct could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business or could materially affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

employees 

as of february 18 2015 we had 2643 employees and believe our relationship with our employees is good our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement

 item 1a risk factors tableend an investment in our securities involves various risks all investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information contained in this annual report before trading in our securities if any of the events set forth in the following risks actually occur our business operating results prospects and financial condition could be harmed 

our performance is subject to risks associated with real estate investments we are a real estate company that derives our income from operation of our stores there are a number of factors that may adversely affect the income that our stores generate including the following 

risks related to our stores and operations 

adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating results 

our operating results are dependent upon our ability to maximize occupancy levels and rental rates in our stores adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we operate may lower our occupancy levels and limit our ability to increase rents or require us to offer rental discounts if our stores fail to generate revenues sufficient to meet our cash requirements including operating and other expenses debt service and capital expenditures our net income funds from operations “ffo” cash flow financial condition ability to make cash distributions to stockholders and the trading price of our securities could be adversely affected the following factors among others may adversely affect the operating performance of our stores 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

if we are unable to promptly relet our units or if the rates upon such reletting are significantly lower than expected our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

virtually all of our leases are on a monthtomonth basis any delay in reletting units as vacancies arise would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results in addition lower than expected rental rates upon reletting could adversely affect our revenues and impede our growth 

we depend upon our onsite personnel to maximize tenant satisfaction at each of our stores and any difficulties we encounter in hiring training and maintaining skilled field personnel may harm our operating performance 

we had 2228 field personnel as of february 18 2015 in the management and operation of our stores the general professionalism of our site managers and staff are contributing factors to a site’s ability to successfully secure rentals and retain tenants we also rely upon our field personnel to maintain clean and secure stores if we are unable to successfully recruit train and retain qualified field personnel the quality of service we strive to provide at our stores could be adversely affected which could lead to decreased occupancy levels and reduced operating performance 

uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flow 

we maintain comprehensive liability fire flood earthquake wind as deemed necessary or as required by our lenders extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our stores certain types of losses however may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable such as losses due to earthquakes hurricanes tornadoes riots acts of war or terrorism should an uninsured loss occur we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a store in addition if any such loss is insured we may be required to pay significant amounts on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to our insurer being obligated to reimburse us for the loss or the amount of the loss may exceed our coverage for the loss as a result our operating results may be adversely affected 

increases in taxes and regulatory compliance costs may reduce our income 

costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws generally are not passed through to tenants directly and will affect us increases in income property or other taxes generally are not passed through to tenants under leases and may reduce our net income ffo cash flow financial condition ability to pay or refinance our debt obligations ability to make cash distributions to stockholders and the trading price of our securities similarly changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on stores or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which could similarly adversely affect our business and results of operations 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our stores may affect our results of operations 

under various us federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations owners and operators of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigating and remediating certain hazardous substances or other regulated materials on or in such property such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such substances or materials the presence of such substances or materials or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s or operator’s ability to lease sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances or other regulated materials may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials into the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real stores for personal injury associated with asbestoscontaining materials 

 

certain environmental laws also impose liability without regard to knowledge or fault for removal or remediation of hazardous substances or other regulated materials upon owners and operators of contaminated property even after they no longer own or operate the property moreover the past or present owner or operator from which a release emanates could be liable for any personal injuries or property damages that may result from such releases as well as any damages to natural resources that may arise from such releases 

certain environmental laws impose compliance obligations on owners and operators of real property with respect to the management of hazardous materials and other regulated substances for example environmental laws govern the management of asbestoscontaining materials and leadbased paint failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties or other sanctions 

no assurances can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of our stores reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner or operator of our stores did not create any material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our stores there also exists the risk that material environmental conditions liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future finally future laws ordinances or regulations and future interpretations of existing laws ordinances or regulations may impose additional material environmental liability 

costs associated with complying with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 may result in unanticipated expenses 

under the ada places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these requirements became effective in 1992 a number of additional us federal state and local laws may also require modifications to our stores or restrict certain further renovations of the stores with respect to access thereto by disabled persons noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature which could result in substantial capital expenditures we have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our stores to determine our compliance and we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with the ada or other legislation if one or more of our stores is not in compliance with the ada or other legislation then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the facility into compliance if we incur substantial costs to comply with the ada or other legislation our financial condition results of operations cash flow per share trading price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make cash distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected 

our tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation which may adversely affect our results 

our tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation the regulatory authorities generally have broad discretion to grant renew and revoke licenses and approvals to promulgate interpret and implement regulations and to evaluate compliance with regulations through periodic examinations audits and investigations of the affairs of insurance providers as a result of regulatory or private action in any jurisdiction we may be temporarily or permanently suspended from continuing some or all of our reinsurance activities or otherwise fined or penalized or suffer an adverse judgment which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we face competition for the acquisition of stores and other assets which may impede our ability to make future acquisitions or may increase the cost of these acquisitions 

we compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of stores and other assets including national regional and local operators and developers of stores these competitors may drive up the price we pay for stores or other assets we seek to acquire or may succeed in acquiring those stores or 

 

assets themselves in addition our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive suitors because they may have greater resources may be willing to pay more or may have a more compatible operating philosophy in addition the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment in stores may increase this competition would result in increased demand for these assets and therefore increased prices paid for them because of an increased interest in singlestore acquisitions among taxmotivated individual purchasers we may pay higher prices if we purchase single stores in comparison with portfolio acquisitions if we pay higher prices for stores or other assets our profitability will be reduced 

we may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria which may impede our growth 

our ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy we may not be successful in identifying suitable stores or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms or at all failure to identify or consummate acquisitions will slow our growth which could in turn adversely affect our stock price 

our ability to acquire stores on favorable terms and successfully integrate and operate them may be constrained by the following significant risks 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition strategic decisions by us such as acquisitions may adversely affect the price of our securities 

we may not be successful in integrating and operating acquired selfstorage stores 

we expect to make future acquisitions of selfstorage stores if we acquire any stores we will be required to integrate them into our existing portfolio the acquired stores may turn out to be less compatible with our growth strategy than originally anticipated may cause disruptions in our operations or may divert management’s attention away from daytoday operations which could impair our operating results as a whole 

we do not always obtain independent appraisals of our stores and thus the consideration paid for these stores may exceed the value that may be indicated by thirdparty appraisals 

we do not always obtain thirdparty appraisals in connection with our acquisition of stores and the consideration being paid by us in exchange for those stores may exceed the value determined by thirdparty appraisals in such cases the value of the stores was determined by our senior management team 

 

our investments in development and redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns which would harm our operating results and reduce the amount of funds available for distributions 

to the extent that we engage in development and redevelopment activities we will be subject to the following risks normally associated with these projects 

 

  

  

  

 in deciding whether to develop or redevelop a particular property we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of the store we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring the property up to the standards established for its intended market position or may be unable to increase occupancy at a newly developed store as quickly as expected or at all any substantial unanticipated delays or expenses could adversely affect the investment returns from these development or redevelopment projects and harm our operating results liquidity and financial condition which could result in a decline in the value of our securities 

we may rely on the investments of our joint venture partners for funding certain of our development and redevelopment projects if our reputation in the selfstorage industry changes or the number of investors considering us an attractive strategic partner is otherwise reduced our ability to develop or redevelop stores could be affected which would limit our growth 

we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes including financial transactions and records personally identifiable information and tenant and lease data we purchase some of our information technology from vendors on whom our systems depend we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential tenant and other sensitive information although we have taken commercially reasonable efforts to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems it is possible that our safety and security measures will not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning or damage or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyberattacks security breaches including physical or electronic breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar breaches can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information while to date we have not experienced a security breach this risk has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication of such breaches and attempted breaches from around the world have increased any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation divert significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

risks related to our organization and structure 

our business could be harmed if key personnel with longstanding business relationships in the selfstorage industry terminate their employment with us 

our success depends on the continued services of members of our executive management team who have substantial experience in the selfstorage industry in addition our ability to acquire or develop stores in the 

 

future depends on the significant relationships our executive management team has developed with our institutional joint venture partners such as affiliates of prudential financial inc there is no guarantee that any of them will remain employed by us we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers the loss of services of one or more members of our executive management team could harm our business and our prospects 

we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business without stockholder consent which may subject us to different risks 

we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business at any time without the consent of our stockholders which could result in our making investments and engaging in business activities that are different from and possibly riskier than the investments and businesses described in this document a change in our investment strategy or our entry into new lines of business may increase our exposure to other risks or real estate market fluctuations 

if other selfstorage companies convert to an upreit structure or if tax laws change we may no longer have an advantage in competing for potential acquisitions 

because we are structured as an upreit we are a more attractive acquirer of stores to taxmotivated sellers than our competitors that are not structured as upreits however if other selfstorage companies restructure their holdings to become upreits this competitive advantage will disappear in addition new legislation may be enacted or new interpretations of existing legislation may be issued by the internal revenue service “irs” or the us treasury department that could affect the attractiveness of our upreit structure so that it may no longer assist us in competing for acquisitions 

tax indemnification obligations may require the operating partnership to maintain certain debt levels 

we have provided certain tax protections to various third parties in connection with their property contributions to the operating partnership upon acquisition by the company including making available the opportunity to 1 guarantee debt or 2 enter into a special loss allocation and deficit restoration obligation we have agreed to these provisions in order to assist these contributors in preserving their tax position after their contributions these obligations may require us to maintain certain indebtedness levels that we would not otherwise require for our business 

our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority 

as of december 31 2014 we held interests in 271 operating selfstorage stores through joint ventures some of these arrangements could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority our reliance on coventurers financial conditions and disputes between us and our coventurers we expect to continue our joint venture strategy by entering into more joint ventures for the purpose of developing new stores and acquiring existing stores in such event we would not be in a position to exercise sole decisionmaking authority regarding the property partnership joint venture or other entity the decisionmaking authority regarding the stores we currently hold through joint ventures is either vested exclusively with our joint venture partners is subject to a majority vote of the joint venture partners or equally shared by us and the joint venture partners in addition investments in partnerships joint ventures or other entities may under certain circumstances involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or coventurers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions partners or coventurers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions such as a sale because neither we nor the partner or coventurer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or coventurers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our 

 

officers andor directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or coventurers might result in subjecting stores owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our thirdparty partners or coventurers which could harm our financial condition 

conflicts of interest could arise as a result of our relationship with our operating partnership 

conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates and our operating partnership or any partner thereof our directors and officers have duties to our company under applicable maryland law in connection with their management of our company at the same time we through our whollyowned subsidiary have fiduciary duties as a general partner to our operating partnership and to the limited partners under delaware law in connection with the management of our operating partnership our duties through our whollyowned subsidiary as a general partner to our operating partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our company the partnership agreement of our operating partnership does not require us to resolve such conflicts in favor of either our company or the limited partners in our operating partnership unless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement delaware law generally requires a general partner of a delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith fairness and loyalty and which generally prohibit such general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest 

additionally the partnership agreement expressly limits our liability by providing that neither we our direct whollyowned massachusetts business trust subsidiary as the general partner of the operating partnership nor any of our or their trustees directors or officers will be liable or accountable in damages to our operating partnership the limited partners or assignees for errors in judgment mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if we or such trustee director or officer acted in good faith in addition our operating partnership is required to indemnify us our affiliates and each of our respective trustees officers directors employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against any and all losses claims damages liabilities whether joint or several expenses including without limitation attorneys’ fees and other legal fees and expenses judgments fines settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims demands actions suits or proceedings civil criminal administrative or investigative that relate to the operations of the operating partnership provided that our operating partnership will not indemnify for 1 willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law 2 any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement or 3 in the case of a criminal proceeding the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful 

the provisions of delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement 

certain provisions of maryland law and our organizational documents including the stock ownership limit imposed by our charter may inhibit market activity in our stock and could prevent or delay a change in control transaction 

our charter subject to certain exceptions authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a reit and to limit any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding common stock or 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limit however our board of directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership limit to any proposed transferee whose ownership could jeopardize our qualification as a reit these restrictions on ownership will not apply if 

 

our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the ownership limit may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders different ownership limits apply to the family of kenneth m woolley certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing to spencer f kirk certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and to certain designated investment entities as defined in our charter 

our board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder approval in addition our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares our board of directors could issue additional shares of our common stock or establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise not be in the best interests of our stockholders 

our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited 

maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances in addition our charter eliminates our directors’ and officers’ liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law as a result we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law in addition we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers 

to the extent our distributions represent a return of capital for us federal income tax purposes our stockholders could recognize an increased capital gain upon a subsequent sale of common stock 

distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and not treated by us as a dividend will not be taxable to a us stockholder under current us federal income tax law to the extent those distributions do not exceed the stockholder’s adjusted tax basis in his her or its common stock but instead will constitute a return of capital and will reduce such adjusted basis if distributions result in a reduction of a stockholder’s adjusted basis in such holder’s common stock subsequent sales of such holder’s common stock will result in recognition of an increased capital gain or decreased capital loss due to the reduction in such adjusted basis 

risks related to the real estate industry 

our primary business involves the ownership and operation of selfstorage stores 

our current strategy is to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop only selfstorage stores consequently we are subject to risks inherent in investments in a single industry because investments in real estate are inherently illiquid this strategy makes it difficult for us to diversify our investment portfolio and to limit our risk when economic conditions change decreases in market rents negative tax real estate and zoning 

 

law changes and changes in environmental protection laws may also increase our costs lower the value of our investments and decrease our income which would adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our stores 

because real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to promptly sell one or more stores in our portfolio in response to changing economic financial and investment conditions is limited the real estate market is affected by many factors such as general economic conditions availability of financing interest rates and other factors including supply and demand that are beyond our control we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any store for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a store 

we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a store can be sold we cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements in acquiring a store we may agree to transfer restrictions that materially restrict us from selling that store for a period of time or impose other restrictions such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that store these transfer restrictions would impede our ability to sell a store even if we deem it necessary or appropriate 

any investments in unimproved real property may take significantly longer to yield incomeproducing returns if at all and may result in additional costs to us to comply with rezoning restrictions or environmental regulations 

we have invested in the past and may invest in the future in unimproved real property unimproved properties generally take longer to yield incomeproducing returns based on the typical time required for development any development of unimproved property may also expose us to the risks and uncertainties associated with rezoning the land for a higher use or development and environmental concerns of governmental entities andor community groups any unsuccessful investments or delays in realizing an incomeproducing return or increased costs to develop unimproved real estate could restrict our ability to earn our targeted rate of return on an investment or adversely affect our ability to pay operating expenses which would harm our financial condition and operating results 

any negative perceptions of the selfstorage industry generally may result in a decline in our stock price 

to the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the selfstorage industry the value of our securities may be negatively impacted which could result in our securities trading below the inherent value of our assets 

risks related to our debt financings 

disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us 

uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to refinance existing debt maturities on favorable terms or at all which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions and fund development projects a downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell stores or may adversely affect the price we receive for stores that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing 

 

required payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our stores or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations 

as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 24 billion of outstanding indebtedness we may incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions and development we may borrow under our credit lines or borrow new funds to finance these future stores additionally we do not anticipate that our internally generated cash flow will be adequate to repay our existing indebtedness upon maturity and therefore we expect to repay our indebtedness through refinancings and equity andor debt offerings further we may need to borrow funds in order to make cash distributions to maintain our qualification as a reit or to make our expected distributions 

if we are required to utilize our credit lines for purposes other than acquisition activity this will reduce the amount available for acquisitions and could slow our growth therefore our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and make cash distributions to our stockholders 

as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 24 billion of debt outstanding of which approximately 846 million or 355 was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps this variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 20 per annum increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase our interest expense which could harm our cash flow and our ability to pay cash distributions for example if market rates of interest on this variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points excluding variable rate debt with interest rate floors the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 81 million annually 

 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations 

in certain cases we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements hedging involves risks such as the risk that the counterparty may fail to honor its obligations under an arrangement failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders 

risks related to qualification and operation as a reit 

to maintain our qualification as a reit we may be forced to borrow funds on a shortterm basis during unfavorable market conditions 

to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our net taxable income each year excluding net capital gains and we are subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income each year in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions made by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years while historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances its own stock assuming we continue to satisfy these distributions requirements with cash we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis or possibly longterm to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these borrowing needs could result from a difference in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for us federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt amortization payments 

dividends payable by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates 

the maximum us federal income tax rate for dividends paid by domestic corporations to individual us stockholders is 20 dividends paid by reits however are generally not eligible for the reduced rates the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause stockholders who are individuals to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits including our securities 

in addition the relative attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends which could negatively affect the value of our stores 

possible legislative or other actions affecting reits could adversely affect our stockholders 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us treasury department changes to tax laws which changes may have retroactive application could adversely affect our stockholders it cannot be predicted whether when in what forms or with what effective dates the tax laws applicable to us or our stockholders will be changed 

the power of our board of directors to revoke our reit election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders 

our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election without the approval of our stockholders if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a reit if we cease to qualify as a reit we would become subject to us federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our net taxable income to our stockholders which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholders 

 

our failure to qualify as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock 

we believe we operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit or lose our qualification as a reit at any time we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution for each of the years involved because 

 

  

  

 in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits this means that our us individual stockholders would be taxed on our dividends at capital gains rates and our us corporate stockholders would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends subject in each case to applicable limitations under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and are able to avail ourselves of one or more of the relief provisions under the internal revenue code in order to maintain our reit status we may nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of 50000 or more for each such failure as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our securities 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the internal revenue code is greater in the case of a reit that like us holds its assets through a partnership the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the composition of our assets the sources of our gross income and the owners of our stock our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market value of our assets some of which are not susceptible to precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our net taxable income excluding capital gains and we will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income including capital gains in addition legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors our ability to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that is intended to allow us to qualify for taxation as a reit we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the internal revenue service regarding our qualification as a reit 

we will pay some taxes 

even though we qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we will be required to pay some us federal state and local taxes on our income and property extra space management inc manages stores for our joint ventures and stores owned by third parties we jointly with extra space management inc elected to treat extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary “trs” of our company for us federal income tax purposes a taxable reit subsidiary is a fully taxable corporation and may be limited in its ability to 

 

deduct interest payments made to us esm reinsurance limited a whollyowned subsidiary of extra space management inc generates income from insurance premiums that are subject to federal income tax and state insurance premiums tax in addition we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements among our tenants our taxable reit subsidiary and us are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties or if we receive payments for inventory or property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business also if we sell property as a dealer ie to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on any gain arising from such sales while we don’t intend to sell stores as a dealer the irs could take a contrary position to the extent that we are or our taxable reit subsidiary is required to pay us federal state or local taxes we will have less cash available for distribution to stockholders 

complying with reit requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 

to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the nature and diversification of our assets the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock in order to meet these tests we may be required to forego attractive business or investment opportunities thus compliance with the reit requirements may adversely affect our ability to operate solely to maximize profits

 item 2 properties tableend as of december 31 2014 we owned or had ownership interests in 828 operating selfstorage stores of these stores 557 are whollyowned and 271 are held in joint ventures in addition we managed an additional 260 stores for third parties bringing the total number of stores which we own andor manage to 1088 these stores are located in 35 states washington dc and puerto rico we receive a management fee generally equal to approximately 60 of cash collected from total revenues to manage the joint venture and third party sites as of december 31 2014 we owned andor managed approximately 804 million square feet of rentable space configured in approximately 725000 separate storage units approximately 70 of our stores are clustered around large population centers such as atlanta baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas houston las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san franciscooakland these markets contain aboveaverage population and income demographics for stores the clustering of assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale our acquisitions have given us an increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in many markets where we had no previous presence 

we consider a store to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization we consider a store to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 or has been open for three years 

as of december 31 2014 approximately 650000 tenants were leasing storage units at the 1088 operating stores that we own andor manage primarily on a monthtomonth basis providing the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit existing tenants generally receive rate increases at least annually for which no direct correlation has been drawn to our vacancy trends although leases are shortterm in duration the typical tenant tends to remain at our stores for an extended period of time for stores that were stabilized as of december 31 2014 the average length of stay was approximately 129 months 

the average annual rent per square foot for our existing customers at stabilized stores net of discounts and bad debt was 1441 for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 1381 for the year ended 

 

december 31 2013 average annual rent per square foot for new leases was 1453 for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 1418 for the year ended december 31 2013 the average discounts as a percentage of rental revenues during these periods were 38 and 44 respectively 

our store portfolio is made up of different types of construction and building configurations depending on the site and the municipality where it is located most often sites are what we consider “hybrid” facilities a mix of both driveup buildings and multifloor buildings we have a number of multifloor buildings with elevator access only and a number of facilities featuring groundfloor access only 

the following table presents additional information regarding the occupancy of our stabilized stores by state as of december 31 2014 and 2013 the information as of december 31 2013 is on a pro forma basis as though all the stores owned at december 31 2014 were under our control as of december 31 2013

overview 

we are a fully integrated selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust or reit formed to continue the business commenced in 1977 by extra space storage llc and its subsidiaries to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop professionally managed selfstorage stores 

at december 31 2014 we owned had ownership interests in or managed 1088 operating stores in 35 states washington dc and puerto rico of these 1088 operating stores we owned 557 we held joint venture interests in 271 stores and our taxable reit subsidiary extra space management inc operated an additional 260 stores that are owned by third parties these operating stores contain approximately 804 million square feet of rentable space in approximately 725000 units and currently serve a customer base of approximately 650000 tenants 

our stores are generally situated in convenient highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as atlanta baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas houston las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san franciscooakland these areas all enjoy above average population growth and income levels the clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale we consider a store to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization a store is considered to be stabilized once it has achieved an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 or has been open for three years 

to maximize the performance of our stores we employ industryleading revenue management systems developed by our management team these systems enable us to analyze set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions we believe our systems and processes allow us to more proactively manage revenues 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under leases at each of our whollyowned stores from management fees on the stores we manage for jointventure partners and unaffiliated third parties and from our tenant reinsurance program our management fee is generally equal to approximately 60 of cash collected from total revenues generated by the managed stores we also receive an asset management fee of 05 of the total asset value from one of our joint ventures 

we operate in competitive markets often where consumers have multiple stores from which to choose competition has impacted and will continue to impact our store results we experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity our operating results depend materially on our ability to lease available selfstorage units to actively manage unit rental rates and on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments we believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the combination of our revenue management team and our industryleading technology systems 

 

we continue to evaluate a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to enable us to maximize stockholder value our strategies to maximize stockholder value include the following 

 

  

  

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those that impact our most critical accounting policies we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies 

consolidation arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as variable interest entities “vies” an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it is the primary beneficiary of the vie 

a vie is created when i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii the entity’s equity holders as a group either a lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance b are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur or c do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur if an entity is deemed to be a vie the enterprise that is deemed to have a variable interest or combination of variable interests that provides the enterprise with a controlling financial interest in the vie is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 

we have concluded that under certain circumstances when we 1 enter into option agreements for the purchase of land or facilities from an entity and pay a nonrefundable deposit or 2 enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures a vie may be created under condition i ii b or c of the previous paragraph for each vie created we have performed a qualitative analysis including considering which party if any has the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of each vie and whether that 

 

party has the obligation to absorb losses of the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could be significant to the vie if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie the assets liabilities and operations of the vie are consolidated with our financial statements as of december 31 2014 we had no consolidated vies additionally our operating partnership has notes payable to three trusts that are vies under condition iia above since the operating partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts these vies are not consolidated 

real estate assets real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation direct and allowable internal costs associated with the development construction renovation and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized interest property taxes and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized 

expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives depreciation is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements which are generally between 5 and 39 years 

in connection with our acquisition of stores the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values which are estimated using significant unobservable inputs the value of the tangible assets consisting of land and buildings is determined as if vacant intangible assets which represent the value of existing tenant relationships are recorded at their fair values based on the avoided cost to replace the current leases we measure the value of tenant relationships based on the rent lost due to the amount of time required to replace existing customers which is based on our historical experience with turnover in our facilities debt assumed as part of an acquisition is recorded at fair value based on current interest rates compared to contractual rates acquisitionrelated transaction costs are expensed as incurred 

intangible lease rights include 1 purchase price amounts allocated to leases on three stores that cannot be classified as ground or building leases these rights are amortized to expense over the term of the leases and 2 intangibles related to ground leases on five stores where the ground leases were assumed by the company at rates that were different than the current market rates for similar leases the value associated with these assumed leases were recorded as intangibles which will be amortized over the lease terms 

evaluation of asset impairment long lived assets held for use are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment we review each store at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist we focus on stores where occupancy andor rental income have decreased by a significant amount for these stores we determine whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the store will likely recover the lost occupancy andor revenue in the short term in addition we review stores in the leaseup stage and compare actual operating results to original projections 

when we determine that an event that may indicate impairment has occurred we compare the carrying value of the related longlived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets an impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the assets 

when real estate assets are identified as held for sale we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the fair value of the assets net of selling costs if the estimated fair values net of selling costs of the assets that have been identified for sale are less than the net carrying value of the assets then a valuation allowance is established the operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are generally presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

 

investments in real estate ventures our investments in real estate joint ventures where we have significant influence but not control and joint ventures which are vies in which we are not the primary beneficiary are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

under the equity method our investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures for the purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows we follow the “look through” approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures under this approach distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital eg a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint venture’s sale of assets in which case it is reported as an investing activity 

our management assesses annually whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired and when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment an investment is impaired if management’s estimate of the fair value of the investment using significant unobservable inputs is less than its carrying value to the extent impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment 

derivative instruments and hedging activities the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk are considered fair value hedges derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges 

for derivatives designated as fair value hedges changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings 

revenue and expense recognition rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants leases are generally on monthtomonth terms prepaid rents are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the leases promotional discounts are recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period late charges administrative fees merchandise sales and truck rentals are recognized in income when earned management fee revenues are recognized monthly as services are performed and in accordance with the terms of the related management agreements equity in earnings of real estate entities is recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate entities interest income is recognized as earned 

property expenses including utilities property taxes repairs and maintenance and other costs to manage the facilities are recognized as incurred we accrue for property tax expense based upon invoice amounts estimates and historical trends if these estimates are incorrect the timing of expense recognition could be affected 

tenant reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the period of insurance coverage we record an unpaid claims liability at the end of each period based on existing unpaid claims and historical claims payment history the unpaid claims liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost to settle all unpaid claims as of each period end including both reported but unpaid claims and claims that may have been incurred but have not been reported we use a third party claims administrator to adjust all tenant reinsurance claims received the administrator evaluates each claim to determine the ultimate claim loss and includes an estimate for claims that may have been incurred but not reported annually a third party actuary evaluates the adequacy of the unpaid 

 

claims liability prior year claim reserves are adjusted as experience develops or new information becomes known the impact of such adjustments is included in the current period operations the unpaid claims liability is not discounted to its present value each tenant chooses the amount of insurance coverage they want through the tenant reinsurance program tenants can purchase policies in amounts of two thousand dollars to ten thousand dollars of insurance coverage in exchange for a monthly fee our exposure per claim is limited by the maximum amount of coverage chosen by each tenant we purchase reinsurance for losses exceeding a set amount on any one event we do not currently have any amounts recoverable under the reinsurance arrangements 

income taxes we have elected to be treated as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code in order to maintain our qualification as a reit among other things we are required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets as a reit we are not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to our stockholders we plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex if we were to fail to meet these requirements we would be subject to federal income tax we are subject to certain state and local taxes provision for such taxes has been included in income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

we have elected to treat one of our corporate subsidiaries extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary “trs” in general our trs may perform additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or nonreal estate related business a trs is subject to corporate federal income tax deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense when incurred

funds from operations 

ffo provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary along with net income and cash flows for an understanding of our operating results we believe ffo is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings net earnings assume that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses the values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and we believe ffo more accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts inc “nareit” as net income computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” excluding gains or losses on sales of operating stores and impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate assets plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis we believe that to further understand our performance ffo should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with gaap as presented in the consolidated financial statements 

 

the computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions 

the following table presents the calculation of ffo for the periods indicated 

 

 samestore results 

we consider our samestore portfolio to consist of only those stores which were whollyowned at the beginning and at the end of the applicable periods presented that had achieved stabilization as of the first day of such period the following tables present operating data for our samestore portfolio we consider the following samestore presentation to be meaningful in regards to the stores shown below because these results provide information relating to store level operating changes without the effects of acquisitions or completed developments

the increases in samestore rental and tenant reinsurance revenues for the three months and year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the same periods ended december 31 2013 were due primarily to an increase in occupancy a decrease in discounts to new customers and an average increase of 40 to 50 in incoming rates to new tenants expenses were higher for the year ended december 31 2014 due to increases in office expense property taxes and repairs and maintenance these expenses were partially offset by a decrease in property insurance in the three months and year ended december 31 2014

our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts during 2014 we experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash or cash equivalents however there can be no assurance that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets

our liquidity needs consist primarily of cash distributions to stockholders store acquisitions principal payments under our borrowings and nonrecurring capital expenditures we may from time to time seek to repurchase our outstanding debt shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors in addition we evaluate on an ongoing basis the merits of strategic acquisitions and other relationships which may require us to raise additional funds we do not expect that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs and instead expect to fund such needs out of additional borrowings of secured or unsecured indebtedness joint ventures with third parties and from the proceeds of public and private offerings of equity and debt additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all any additional issuance of equity or equitylinked securities may result in dilution to our stockholders in addition any new securities we issue could have rights preferences and privileges senior to holders of our common stock we may also use op units as currency to fund acquisitions from selfstorage owners who desire taxdeferral in their exiting transactions

financing strategy

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk 

market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our future income cash flows and fair values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary and tax policies domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 2379657 in total face value debt of which approximately 845764 was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt excluding variable rate debt with interest rate floors would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 8081 annually 

interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur further in the event of a change of that magnitude we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure

industry  competition 

selfstorage facilities refers to properties that offer monthtomonth storage space rental for personal or business use selfstorage offers a costeffective and flexible storage alternative tenants rent fully enclosed spaces that can vary in size according to their specific needs and to which they have unlimited exclusive access tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units selfstorage unit sizes typically range from 5 feet by 5 feet to 20 feet by 20 feet with an interior height of 8 feet to 12 feet properties generally have onsite managers who supervise and run the daytoday operations providing tenants with assistance as needed 

selfstorage provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions due to life changes or simply because of a need for storage space the mix of residential tenants using a selfstorage property is determined by a propertys local demographics and often includes people who are looking to downsize their living space or others who are not yet settled into a permanent residence items that residential tenants place in selfstorage properties range from cars boats and recreational vehicles to furniture household items and appliances commercial tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods records inventory or storage for seasonal goods 

our research has shown that tenants choose a selfstorage property based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or business making highdensity hightraffic population centers ideal locations for selfstorage properties a propertys perceived security and the general professionalism of the site managers and staff are also contributing factors to a sites ability to successfully secure rentals although most selfstorage properties are leased to tenants on a monthtomonth basis tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time 

the selfstorage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations a greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from may through september historically our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of july while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early march 

since inception in the early 1970s the selfstorage industry has experienced significant growth according to the selfstorage almanac the almanac in 2003 there were only 37011 selfstorage properties in the united states with an average physical occupancy rate of 861 of net rentable square feet compared to 48151 selfstorage properties in 2013 with an average physical occupancy rate of 878 of net rentable square feet 

we have encountered competition when we have sought to acquire properties especially for brokered portfolios aggressive bidding practices have been commonplace between both public and private entities and this competition will likely continue 

the industry is also characterized by fragmented ownership according to the almanac the top ten selfstorage companies in the united states owned approximately 122 of total us selfstorage properties and the top 50 selfstorage companies owned approximately 159 of the total us properties as of december 31 2013 we believe this fragmentation will contribute to continued consolidation at some level in the future we also believe that we are well positioned to compete for acquisitions given our historical reputation for closing deals 

we are the second largest selfstorage operator in the united states we are one of four public selfstorage reits along with public storage inc cubesmart and sovran selfstorage inc 

longterm growth and investment strategies 

our primary business objectives are to maximize cash flow available for distribution to our stockholders and to achieve sustainable longterm growth in cash flow per share in order to maximize longterm stockholder value we continue to evaluate a range of growth initiatives and opportunities including the following 

• maximize the performance of properties through strategic efficient and proactive management we pursue revenuegenerating and expenseminimizing opportunities in our operations our revenue management team seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our technology systems ability to provide realtime interactive rental rate and discount management our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement more effective online marketing programs which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost • acquire selfstorage properties our acquisitions team continues to pursue the acquisition of multiproperty portfolios and single properties that we believe can provide stockholder value we have established a reputation as a reliable ethical buyer which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions in addition we believe our status as an upreit enables flexibility when structuring deals we continue to bid on available acquisitions and are seeing increasing prices however we remain a disciplined buyer and look for acquisitions that will strengthen our portfolio and increase stockholder value • expand our management business our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and expand our geographic footprint we believe this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale in addition we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline we pursue strategic relationships with owners whose properties would enhance our portfolio in the event an opportunity arises to acquire such properties 5

we will continue to review our portfolio for properties or groups of properties that are not strategically located and determine whether to dispose of these properties to fund other growth 

regulation 

generally selfstorage properties are subject to various laws ordinances and regulations including regulations relating to lien sale rights and procedures changes in any of these laws or regulations as well as changes in laws such as the comprehensive environmental response and compensation liability act which increase the potential liability for environmental conditions or circumstances 

existing or created by tenants or others on properties or laws affecting development construction operation upkeep safety and taxation may result in significant unanticipated expenditures loss of selfstorage sites or other impairments to operations which would adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

under the americans with disabilities act of 1990 the ada places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these requirements became effective in 1992 a number of additional us federal state and local laws also exist that may require modifications to the properties or restrict further renovations thereof with respect to access thereto by disabled persons noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature thereby requiring substantial capital expenditures to the extent our properties are not in compliance we are likely to incur additional costs to comply with the ada 

insurance activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state in accordance with the mccarranferguson act and are subject to the grammleachbliley act and the privacy regulations promulgated by the federal trade commission pursuant thereto

employees 

as of february 14 2014 we had 2584 employees and believe our relationship with our employees is good our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement 




 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our securities involves various risks all investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information contained in this annual report before trading in our securities if any of the events set forth in the following risks actually occur our business operating results prospects and financial condition could be harmed 

our performance is subject to risks associated with real estate investments we are a real estate company that derives our income from operation of our properties there are a number of factors that may adversely affect the income that our properties generate including the following 

risks related to our properties and operations 

adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating results 

our operating results are dependent upon our ability to maximize occupancy levels and rental rates in our selfstorage properties adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we operate may lower our occupancy levels and limit our ability to increase rents or require us to offer rental discounts if our properties fail to generate revenues sufficient to meet our cash requirements including operating and other expenses debt service and capital expenditures our net income funds from operations ffo cash flow financial condition ability to make cash distributions to 

stockholders and the trading price of our securities could be adversely affected the following factors among others may adversely affect the operating performance of our properties 

• the national economic climate and the local or regional economic climate in the markets in which we operate which may be adversely impacted by among other factors industry slowdowns relocation of businesses and changing demographics • periods of economic slowdown or recession rising interest rates or declining demand for selfstorage or the public perception that any of these events may occur could result in a general decline in rental rates or an increase in tenant defaults • a decline of the current economic environment • local or regional real estate market conditions such as competing properties the oversupply of selfstorage or a reduction in demand for selfstorage in a particular area • perceptions by prospective users of our selfstorage properties of the safety convenience and attractiveness of our properties and the neighborhoods in which they are located • increased operating costs including the need for capital improvements insurance premiums real estate taxes and utilities • the impact of environmental protection laws • changes in tax real estate and zoning laws and • earthquakes hurricanes and other natural disasters terrorist acts civil disturbances or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses if we are unable to promptly relet our units or if the rates upon such reletting are significantly lower than expected our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

virtually all of our leases are on a monthtomonth basis any delay in reletting units as vacancies arise would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results in addition lower than expected rental rates upon reletting could adversely affect our revenues and impede our growth 

we depend upon our onsite personnel to maximize tenant satisfaction at each of our properties and any difficulties we encounter in hiring training and maintaining skilled field personnel may harm our operating performance 

we had 2241 field personnel as of february 14 2014 in the management and operation of our properties the general professionalism of our site managers and staff are contributing factors to a sites ability to successfully secure rentals and retain tenants we also rely upon our field personnel to maintain clean and secure selfstorage properties if we are unable to successfully recruit train and retain qualified field personnel the quality of service we strive to provide at our properties could be adversely affected which could lead to decreased occupancy levels and reduced operating performance 

uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flow 

we maintain comprehensive liability fire flood earthquake wind as deemed necessary or as required by our lenders extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our properties certain types of losses however may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable such as losses due to earthquakes hurricanes tornadoes riots acts of war or terrorism should an uninsured loss occur we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a property in addition if any such loss is insured we may be required to pay significant amounts on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to our insurer being obligated to reimburse us for the loss or the amount 

of the loss may exceed our coverage for the loss as a result our operating results may be adversely affected 

increases in taxes and regulatory compliance costs may reduce our income 

costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws generally are not passed through to tenants directly and will affect us increases in income property or other taxes generally are not passed through to tenants under leases and may reduce our net income ffo cash flow financial condition ability to pay or refinance our debt obligations ability to make cash distributions to stockholders and the trading price of our securities similarly changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which could similarly adversely affect our business and results of operations 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our properties may affect our results of operations 

under various us federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations owners and operators of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigating and remediating certain hazardous substances or other regulated materials on or in such property such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such substances or materials the presence of such substances or materials or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owners or operators ability to lease sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances or other regulated materials may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials into the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with asbestoscontaining materials 

certain environmental laws also impose liability without regard to knowledge or fault for removal or remediation of hazardous substances or other regulated materials upon owners and operators of contaminated property even after they no longer own or operate the property moreover the past or present owner or operator from which a release emanates could be liable for any personal injuries or property damages that may result from such releases as well as any damages to natural resources that may arise from such releases 

certain environmental laws impose compliance obligations on owners and operators of real property with respect to the management of hazardous materials and other regulated substances for example environmental laws govern the management of asbestoscontaining materials and leadbased paint failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties or other sanctions 

no assurances can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner or operator of our properties did not create any material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our properties there also exists the risk that material environmental conditions liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future finally future laws ordinances or regulations and future interpretations of existing laws ordinances or regulations may impose additional material environmental liability 

costs associated with complying with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 may result in unanticipated expenses 

under the ada places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these requirements became effective in 1992 a number of additional us federal state and local laws may also require modifications to our properties or restrict certain further renovations of the properties with respect to access thereto by disabled persons noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature which could result in substantial capital expenditures we have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine our compliance and we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with the ada or other legislation if one or more of our properties is not in compliance with the ada or other legislation then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the facility into compliance if we incur substantial costs to comply with the ada or other legislation our financial condition results of operations cash flow per share trading price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make cash distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected 

our tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation which may adversely affect our results 

our tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation the regulatory authorities generally have broad discretion to grant renew and revoke licenses and approvals to promulgate interpret and implement regulations and to evaluate compliance with regulations through periodic examinations audits and investigations of the affairs of insurance providers as a result of regulatory or private action in any jurisdiction we may be temporarily or permanently suspended from continuing some or all of our reinsurance activities or otherwise fined or penalized or suffer an adverse judgment which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we face competition for the acquisition of selfstorage properties and other assets which may impede our ability to make future acquisitions or may increase the cost of these acquisitions 

we compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of selfstorage properties and other assets including national regional and local operators and developers of selfstorage properties these competitors may drive up the price we pay for selfstorage properties or other assets we seek to acquire or may succeed in acquiring those properties or assets themselves in addition our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive suitors because they may have greater resources may be willing to pay more or may have a more compatible operating philosophy in addition the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment properties may increase this competition would result in increased demand for these assets and therefore increased prices paid for them because of an increased interest in single property acquisitions among taxmotivated individual purchasers we may pay higher prices if we purchase single properties in comparison with portfolio acquisitions if we pay higher prices for selfstorage properties or other assets our profitability will be reduced 

we may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria which may impede our growth 

our ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy we may not be successful in identifying suitable properties or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions or investments on 

satisfactory terms or at all failure to identify or consummate acquisitions will slow our growth which could in turn adversely affect our stock price 

our ability to acquire properties on favorable terms and successfully integrate and operate them may be constrained by the following significant risks 

• competition from local investors and other real estate investors with significant capital including other publiclytraded reits and institutional investment funds • competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price which could reduce our profitability • the inability to achieve satisfactory completion of due diligence investigations and other customary closing conditions • failure to finance an acquisition on favorable terms or at all • we may spend more than the time and amounts budgeted to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties and • we may acquire properties subject to liabilities without any recourse or with only limited recourse with respect to unknown liabilities such as liabilities for cleanup of undisclosed environmental contamination claims by persons dealing with the former owners of the properties and claims for indemnification by general partners directors officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties in addition strategic decisions by us such as acquisitions may adversely affect the price of our securities 

we may not be successful in integrating and operating acquired properties 

we expect to make future acquisitions of selfstorage properties if we acquire any selfstorage properties we will be required to integrate them into our existing portfolio the acquired properties may turn out to be less compatible with our growth strategy than originally anticipated may cause disruptions in our operations or may divert managements attention away from daytoday operations which could impair our operating results as a whole 

we do not always obtain independent appraisals of our properties and thus the consideration paid for these properties may exceed the value that may be indicated by thirdparty appraisals 

we do not always obtain thirdparty appraisals in connection with our acquisition of properties and the consideration being paid by us in exchange for those properties may exceed the value determined by thirdparty appraisals in such cases the value of the properties was determined by our senior management team 

our investments in development and redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns which would harm our operating results and reduce the amount of funds available for distributions 

to the extent that we engage in development and redevelopment activities we will be subject to the following risks normally associated with these projects 

• we may be unable to obtain financing for these projects on favorable terms or at all • we may not complete development or redevelopment projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts • we may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning land use building occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations and 11 

• occupancy rates and rents at newly developed or redeveloped properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors including market and economic conditions and may result in our investment not being profitable in deciding whether to develop or redevelop a particular property we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring the property up to the standards established for its intended market position or may be unable to increase occupancy at a newly developed property as quickly as expected or at all any substantial unanticipated delays or expenses could adversely affect the investment returns from these development or redevelopment projects and harm our operating results liquidity and financial condition which could result in a decline in the value of our securities 

we may rely on the investments of our joint venture partners for funding certain of our development and redevelopment projects if our reputation in the selfstorage industry changes or the number of investors considering us an attractive strategic partner is otherwise reduced our ability to develop or redevelop properties could be affected which would limit our growth 

risks related to our organization and structure 

our business could be harmed if key personnel with longstanding business relationships in the selfstorage industry terminate their employment with us 

our success depends on the continued services of members of our executive management team who have substantial experience in the selfstorage industry in addition our ability to acquire or develop properties in the future depends on the significant relationships our executive management team has developed with our institutional joint venture partners such as affiliates of prudential financial inc there is no guarantee that any of them will remain employed by us we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers the loss of services of one or more members of our executive management team could harm our business and our prospects 

we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business without stockholder consent which may subject us to different risks 

we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business at any time without the consent of our stockholders which could result in our making investments and engaging in business activities that are different from and possibly riskier than the investments and businesses described in this document a change in our investment strategy or our entry into new lines of business may increase our exposure to other risks or real estate market fluctuations 

if other selfstorage companies convert to an upreit structure or if tax laws change we may no longer have an advantage in competing for potential acquisitions 

because we are structured as an upreit we are a more attractive acquirer of properties to taxmotivated sellers than our competitors that are not structured as upreits however if other selfstorage companies restructure their holdings to become upreits this competitive advantage will disappear in addition new legislation may be enacted or new interpretations of existing legislation may be issued by the internal revenue service irs or the us treasury department that could affect the attractiveness of our upreit structure so that it may no longer assist us in competing for acquisitions 

tax indemnification obligations may require the operating partnership to maintain certain debt levels 

we have provided certain tax protections to various third parties in connection with their property contributions to the operating partnership upon acquisition by the company including making 

available the opportunity to 1 guarantee debt or 2 enter into a special loss allocation and deficit restoration obligation we have agreed to these provisions in order to assist these contributors in preserving their tax position after their contributions these obligations may require us to maintain certain indebtedness levels that we would not otherwise require for our business 

our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority 

as of december 31 2013 we held interests in 273 operating properties through joint ventures some of these arrangements could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority our reliance on coventurers financial conditions and disputes between us and our coventurers we expect to continue our joint venture strategy by entering into more joint ventures for the purpose of developing new selfstorage properties and acquiring existing properties in such event we would not be in a position to exercise sole decisionmaking authority regarding the property partnership joint venture or other entity the decisionmaking authority regarding the properties we currently hold through joint ventures is either vested exclusively with our joint venture partners is subject to a majority vote of the joint venture partners or equally shared by us and the joint venture partners in addition investments in partnerships joint ventures or other entities may under certain circumstances involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or coventurers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions partners or coventurers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions such as a sale because neither we nor the partner or coventurer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or coventurers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers andor directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or coventurers might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our thirdparty partners or coventurers which could harm our financial condition 

conflicts of interest could arise as a result of our relationship with our operating partnership 

conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates and our operating partnership or any partner thereof our directors and officers have duties to our company under applicable maryland law in connection with their management of our company at the same time we through our whollyowned subsidiary have fiduciary duties as a general partner to our operating partnership and to the limited partners under delaware law in connection with the management of our operating partnership our duties through our whollyowned subsidiary as a general partner to our operating partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our company the partnership agreement of our operating partnership does not require us to resolve such conflicts in favor of either our company or the limited partners in our operating partnership unless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement delaware law generally requires a general partner of a delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith fairness and loyalty and which generally prohibit such general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest 

additionally the partnership agreement expressly limits our liability by providing that neither we our direct whollyowned massachusetts business trust subsidiary as the general partner of the operating partnership nor any of our or their trustees directors or officers will be liable or accountable in damages to our operating partnership the limited partners or assignees for errors in judgment mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if we or such trustee director or officer 

acted in good faith in addition our operating partnership is required to indemnify us our affiliates and each of our respective trustees officers directors employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against any and all losses claims damages liabilities whether joint or several expenses including without limitation attorneys fees and other legal fees and expenses judgments fines settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims demands actions suits or proceedings civil criminal administrative or investigative that relate to the operations of the operating partnership provided that our operating partnership will not indemnify for 1 willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law 2 any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement or 3 in the case of a criminal proceeding the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful 

the provisions of delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement 

certain provisions of maryland law and our organizational documents including the stock ownership limit imposed by our charter may inhibit market activity in our stock and could prevent or delay a change in control transaction 

our charter subject to certain exceptions authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a reit and to limit any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding common stock or 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limit however our board of directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership limit to any proposed transferee whose ownership could jeopardize our qualification as a reit these restrictions on ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the ownership limit may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders different ownership limits apply to the family of kenneth m woolley certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing to spencer f kirk certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and to certain designated investment entities as defined in our charter 

our board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder approval in addition our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares our board of directors could issue additional shares of our common stock or establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise not be in the best interests of our stockholders 

our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited 

maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances in addition our charter eliminates our directors and officers liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law as a result we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law in addition we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers 

to the extent our distributions represent a return of capital for us federal income tax purposes our stockholders could recognize an increased capital gain upon a subsequent sale of common stock 

distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and not treated by us as a dividend will not be taxable to a us stockholder under current us federal income tax law to the extent those distributions do not exceed the stockholders adjusted tax basis in his her or its common stock but instead will constitute a return of capital and will reduce such adjusted basis if distributions result in a reduction of a stockholders adjusted basis in such holders common stock subsequent sales of such holders common stock will result in recognition of an increased capital gain or decreased capital loss due to the reduction in such adjusted basis 

risks related to the real estate industry 

our primary business involves the ownership and operation of selfstorage properties 

our current strategy is to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop only selfstorage properties consequently we are subject to risks inherent in investments in a single industry because investments in real estate are inherently illiquid this strategy makes it difficult for us to diversify our investment portfolio and to limit our risk when economic conditions change decreases in market rents negative tax real estate and zoning law changes and changes in environmental protection laws may also increase our costs lower the value of our investments and decrease our income which would adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties 

because real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in our portfolio in response to changing economic financial and investment conditions is limited the real estate market is affected by many factors such as general economic conditions availability of financing interest rates and other factors including supply and demand that are beyond our control we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property 

we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold we cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements in acquiring a property we may agree to transfer restrictions that materially restrict us from selling that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions such 

as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property these transfer restrictions would impede our ability to sell a property even if we deem it necessary or appropriate 

any investments in unimproved real property may take significantly longer to yield incomeproducing returns if at all and may result in additional costs to us to comply with rezoning restrictions or environmental regulations 

we have invested in the past and may invest in the future in unimproved real property unimproved properties generally take longer to yield incomeproducing returns based on the typical time required for development any development of unimproved property may also expose us to the risks and uncertainties associated with rezoning the land for a higher use or development and environmental concerns of governmental entities andor community groups any unsuccessful investments or delays in realizing an incomeproducing return or increased costs to develop unimproved real estate could restrict our ability to earn our targeted rate of return on an investment or adversely affect our ability to pay operating expenses which would harm our financial condition and operating results 

any negative perceptions of the selfstorage industry generally may result in a decline in our stock price 

to the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the selfstorage industry the value of our securities may be negatively impacted which could result in our securities trading below the inherent value of our assets 

risks related to our debt financings 

disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us 

uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to refinance existing debt maturities on favorable terms or at all which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions and fund development projects a downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing 

required payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our properties or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations 

as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 20 billion of outstanding indebtedness we may incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions and development we may borrow under our credit lines or borrow new funds to finance these future properties additionally we do not anticipate that our internally generated cash flow will be adequate to repay our existing indebtedness upon maturity and therefore we expect to repay our indebtedness through refinancings and equity andor debt offerings further we may need to borrow funds in order to make cash distributions to maintain our qualification as a reit or to make our expected distributions 

if we are required to utilize our credit lines for purposes other than acquisition activity this will reduce the amount available for acquisitions and could slow our growth therefore our level of debt 

and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences including the following 

• our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments • we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms including to make acquisitions or to continue to make distributions required to maintain our qualification as a reit • we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness • because a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates an increase in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense • we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties possibly on disadvantageous terms • after debt service the amount available for cash distributions to our stockholders is reduced • our debt level could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt • we may experience increased vulnerability to economic and industry downturns reducing our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions • we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases • we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgages may enforce our guarantees • we may violate restrictive covenants in our loan documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations and • our default under any one of our mortgage loans with crossdefault or crosscollateralization provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness or result in the foreclosures of other properties we could become highly leveraged in the future because our organizational documents contain no limitation on the amount of debt we may incur 

our organizational documents contain no limitations on the amount of indebtedness that we or our operating partnership may incur we could alter the balance between our total outstanding indebtedness and the value of our portfolio at any time if we become more highly leveraged the resulting increase in debt service could adversely affect our ability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness and to pay our anticipated cash distributions andor to continue to make cash distributions to maintain our reit qualification and could harm our financial condition 

increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and make cash distributions to our stockholders 

as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 1958 million of debt outstanding of which approximately 3393 million or 173 was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps this variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 21 per annum increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase our interest expense which could harm our cash flow and our ability to pay cash distributions for example if market rates of interest on this variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points excluding variable rate debt with 

interest rate floors the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 30 million annually 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations 

in certain cases we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements hedging involves risks such as the risk that the counterparty may fail to honor its obligations under an arrangement failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders 

risks related to qualification and operation as a reit 

to maintain our qualification as a reit we may be forced to borrow funds on a shortterm basis during unfavorable market conditions 

to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our net taxable income each year excluding net capital gains and we are subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income each year in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions made by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years while historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances its own stock assuming we continue to satisfy these distributions requirements with cash we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis or possibly longterm to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these borrowing needs could result from a difference in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for us federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt amortization payments 

dividends payable by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates 

the maximum us federal income tax rate for dividends paid by domestic corporations to individual us stockholders is 20 dividends paid by reits however are generally not eligible for the reduced rates the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause stockholders who are individuals to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits including our securities 

in addition the relative attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends which could negatively affect the value of our properties 

possible legislative or other actions affecting reits could adversely affect our stockholders 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us treasury department changes to tax laws which changes may have retroactive application could adversely affect our stockholders it cannot be predicted whether when in what forms or with what effective dates the tax laws applicable to us or our stockholders will be changed 

the power of our board of directors to revoke our reit election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders 

our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election without the approval of our stockholders if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a reit if we cease to qualify as a reit we would become subject to us federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our net taxable income to our stockholders which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholders 

our failure to qualify as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock 

we believe we operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit or lose our qualification as a reit at any time we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution for each of the years involved because 

• we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates • we also could be subject to the us federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes and • unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following a year during which we were disqualified in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits this means that our us individual stockholders would be taxed on our dividends at capital gains rates and our us corporate stockholders would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends subject in each case to applicable limitations under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and are able to avail ourselves of one or more of the relief provisions under the internal revenue code in order to maintain our reit status we may nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of 50000 or more for each such failure as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our securities 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the internal revenue code is greater in the case of a reit that like us holds its assets through a partnership the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the composition of our assets the sources of our gross income and the owners of our stock our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market value of our assets some of which are not susceptible to precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our net taxable income excluding capital gains and we will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income including capital gains in addition legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors our ability to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in 

a reit relative to other investments although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that is intended to allow us to qualify for taxation as a reit we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the internal revenue service regarding our qualification as a reit 

we will pay some taxes 

even though we qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we will be required to pay some us federal state and local taxes on our income and property extra space management inc manages selfstorage properties for our joint ventures and properties owned by third parties we jointly with extra space management inc elected to treat extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary trs of our company for us federal income tax purposes a taxable reit subsidiary is a fully taxable corporation and may be limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to us esm reinsurance limited a whollyowned subsidiary of extra space management inc generates income from insurance premiums that are subject to federal income tax and state insurance premiums tax in addition we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements among our tenants our taxable reit subsidiary and us are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties or if we receive payments for inventory or property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business also if we sell property as a dealer ie to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on any gain arising from such sales while we dont intend to sell properties as a dealer the irs could take a contrary position to the extent that we are or our taxable reit subsidiary is required to pay us federal state or local taxes we will have less cash available for distribution to stockholders 

complying with reit requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 

to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the nature and diversification of our assets the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock in order to meet these tests we may be required to forego attractive business or investment opportunities thus compliance with the reit requirements may adversely affect our ability to operate solely to maximize profits

 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2013 we owned or had ownership interests in 779 operating selfstorage properties of these properties 506 are whollyowned and 273 are held in joint ventures in addition we managed an additional 250 properties for third parties bringing the total number of properties which we own andor manage to 1029 these properties are located in 35 states washington dc and puerto rico we receive a management fee generally equal to approximately 6 of cash collected from total revenues to manage the joint venture and third party sites as of december 31 2013 we owned andor managed approximately 757 million square feet of rentable space configured in approximately 680000 separate storage units approximately 70 of our properties are clustered around large population centers such as atlanta baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas houston las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san franciscooakland these markets contain aboveaverage population and income demographics for selfstorage properties the clustering of assets around these population centers enables us to 

reduce our operating costs through economies of scale our acquisitions have given us an increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in many markets where we had no previous presence 

we consider a property to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization we consider a property to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 or has been open for three years 

as of december 31 2013 approximately 600000 tenants were leasing storage units at the 1029 operating properties that we own andor manage primarily on a monthtomonth basis providing the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit existing tenants generally receive rate increases at least annually for which no direct correlation has been drawn to our vacancy trends although leases are shortterm in duration the typical tenant tends to remain at our properties for an extended period of time for properties that were stabilized as of december 31 2013 the average length of stay was approximately 12 months 

the average annual rent per square foot for our existing customers at stabilized properties net of discounts and bad debt was 1396 for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 1338 for the year ended december 31 2012 average annual rent per square foot for new leases was 1418 for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 1381 for the same period ended december 31 2012 the average discounts as a percentage of rental revenues during these periods were 44 and 51 respectively 

our property portfolio is made up of different types of construction and building configurations depending on the site and the municipality where it is located most often sites are what we consider hybrid facilities a mix of both driveup buildings and multifloor buildings we have a number of multifloor buildings with elevator access only and a number of facilities featuring groundfloor access only 

the following table presents additional information regarding the occupancy of our stabilized properties by state as of december 31 2013 and 2012 the information as of december 31 2012 is on a pro forma basis as though all the properties owned at december 31 2013 were under our control as of december 31 2012

overview 

we are a fully integrated selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust or reit formed to continue the business commenced in 1977 by extra space storage llc and its subsidiaries to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop professionally managed selfstorage facilities 

at december 31 2013 we owned had ownership interests in or managed 1029 operating properties in 35 states washington dc and puerto rico of these 1029 operating properties we owned 506 we held joint venture interests in 273 properties and our taxable reit subsidiary extra space management inc operated an additional 250 properties that are owned by third parties these operating properties contain approximately 757 million square feet of rentable space in approximately 680000 units and currently serve a customer base of approximately 600000 tenants 

our properties are generally situated in convenient highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as atlanta baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas houston las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san franciscooakland these areas all enjoy above average population growth and income levels the clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale we consider a property to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization a property is considered to be stabilized once it has achieved an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 or has been open for three years 

to maximize the performance of our properties we employ industryleading revenue management systems developed by our management team these systems enable us to analyze set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions we believe our systems and processes allow us to more proactively manage revenues 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under leases at each of our whollyowned selfstorage properties from management fees on the properties we manage for jointventure partners and unaffiliated third parties and from our tenant reinsurance program our management fee is generally equal to approximately 6 of cash collected from total revenues generated by the managed properties we also receive an asset management fee of 05 of the total asset value from one of our joint ventures 

we operate in competitive markets often where consumers have multiple selfstorage properties from which to choose competition has impacted and will continue to impact our property results we experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity our operating results depend materially on our ability to lease available selfstorage units to actively manage unit rental rates and on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments we believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the combination of our revenue management team and our industryleading technology systems 

we continue to evaluate a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to enable us to maximize stockholder value our strategies to maximize stockholder value include the following 

• maximize the performance of properties through strategic efficient and proactive management we pursue revenuegenerating and expenseminimizing opportunities in our operations our revenue management team seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our technology systems ability to provide realtime interactive rental rate and discount management our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement more effective online marketing programs which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost • acquire selfstorage properties our acquisitions team continues to pursue the acquisition of multiproperty portfolios and single properties that we believe can provide stockholder value we have established a reputation as a reliable ethical buyer which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions in addition we believe our status as an upreit enables flexibility when structuring deals we continue to see available acquisitions on which to bid and are seeing increasing prices however we remain a disciplined buyer and look for acquisitions that will strengthen our portfolio and increase stockholder value • expand our management business our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and expand our geographic footprint we believe this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale in addition we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline we pursue strategic relationships with owners whose properties would enhance our portfolio in the event an opportunity arises to acquire such properties critical accounting policies and estimates 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those that impact our most critical accounting policies we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies 

consolidation arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as variable interest entities vies an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it is the primary beneficiary of the vie 

a vie is created when i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii the entitys equity holders as a group either a lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance b are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur or c do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur if an entity is deemed to be a vie the enterprise that is deemed to have a variable interest or combination of variable interests that provides the enterprise with a controlling financial interest in the vie is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 

we have concluded that under certain circumstances when we 1 enter into option agreements for the purchase of land or facilities from an entity and pay a nonrefundable deposit or 2 enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures a vie may be created under condition i ii b or 

c of the previous paragraph for each vie created we have performed a qualitative analysis including considering which party if any has the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of each vie and whether that party has the obligation to absorb losses of the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could be significant to the vie if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie the assets liabilities and operations of the vie are consolidated with our financial statements as of december 31 2013 we had no consolidated vies additionally our operating partnership has notes payable to three trusts that are vies under condition iia above since the operating partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts these vies are not consolidated 

real estate assets real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation direct and allowable internal costs associated with the development construction renovation and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized interest property taxes and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized 

expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives depreciation is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements which are generally between 5 and 39 years 

in connection with our acquisition of properties the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values which are estimated using significant unobservable inputs the value of the tangible assets consisting of land and buildings is determined as if vacant intangible assets which represent the value of existing tenant relationships are recorded at their fair values based on the avoided cost to replace the current leases we measure the value of tenant relationships based on the rent lost due to the amount of time required to replace existing customers which is based on our historical experience with turnover in our facilities debt assumed as part of an acquisition is recorded at fair value based on current interest rates compared to contractual rates acquisitionrelated transaction costs are expensed as incurred 

intangible lease rights include 1 purchase price amounts allocated to leases on three properties that cannot be classified as ground or building leases these rights are amortized to expense over the term of the leases and 2 intangibles related to ground leases on five properties where the ground leases were assumed by the company at rates that were different than the current market rates for similar leases the value associated with these assumed leases were recorded as intangibles which will be amortized over the lease terms 

evaluation of asset impairment long lived assets held for use are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment we review each storage facility at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist we focus on facilities where occupancy andor rental income have decreased by a significant amount for these facilities we determine whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the facility will likely recover the lost occupancy andor revenue in the short term in addition we review facilities in the leaseup stage and compare actual operating results to original projections 

when we determine that an event that may indicate impairment has occurred we compare the carrying value of the related longlived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets an impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the assets 

when real estate assets are identified as held for sale we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the fair value of the assets net of selling costs if the estimated fair values net of selling costs of the assets that have been identified for sale are less than the net carrying value of the assets then a 

valuation allowance is established the operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are generally presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

investments in real estate ventures our investments in real estate joint ventures where we have significant influence but not control and joint ventures which are vies in which we are not the primary beneficiary are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

under the equity method our investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures for the purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows we follow the look through approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures under this approach distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital eg a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint ventures sale of assets in which case it is reported as an investing activity 

our management assesses annually whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired and when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment an investment is impaired if managements estimate of the fair value of the investment using significant unobservable inputs is less than its carrying value to the extent impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment 

derivative instruments and hedging activities the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk are considered fair value hedges derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges 

for derivatives designated as fair value hedges changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings 

revenue and expense recognition rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants leases are generally on monthtomonth terms prepaid rents are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the leases promotional discounts are recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period late charges administrative fees merchandise sales and truck rentals are recognized in income when earned management fee revenues are recognized monthly as services are performed and in accordance with the terms of the related management agreements equity in earnings of real estate entities is recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate entities interest income is recognized as earned 

tenant reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the period of insurance coverage we record an unpaid claims liability at the end of each period based on existing unpaid claims and historical claims payment history the unpaid claims liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost to settle all unpaid claims as of each period end including both reported but unpaid claims and claims that may have been incurred but have not been reported we use a third party claims administrator to adjust all tenant reinsurance claims received the administrator evaluates each claim to determine the 

ultimate claim loss and includes an estimate for claims that may have been incurred but not reported annually a third party actuary evaluates the adequacy of the unpaid claims liability prior year claim reserves are adjusted as experience develops or new information becomes known the impact of such adjustments is included in the current period operations the unpaid claims liability is not discounted to its present value each tenant chooses the amount of insurance coverage they want through the tenant reinsurance program tenants can purchase policies in amounts of two thousand dollars to ten thousand dollars of insurance coverage in exchange for a monthly fee our exposure per claim is limited by the maximum amount of coverage chosen by each tenant we purchase reinsurance for losses exceeding a set amount on any one event we do not currently have any amounts recoverable under the reinsurance arrangements 

property expenses including utilities property taxes repairs and maintenance and other costs to manage the facilities are recognized as incurred we accrue for property tax expense based upon invoice amounts estimates and historical trends if these estimates are incorrect the timing of expense recognition could be affected 

income taxes we have elected to be treated as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code in order to maintain our qualification as a reit among other things we are required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets as a reit we are not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to our stockholders we plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex if we were to fail to meet these requirements we would be subject to federal income tax we are subject to certain state and local taxes provision for such taxes has been included in income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

we have elected to treat one of our corporate subsidiaries extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary trs in general our trs may perform additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or nonreal estate related business a trs is subject to corporate federal income tax deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense when incurred

funds from operations 

ffo provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary along with net income and cash flows for an understanding of our operating results we believe ffo is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings net earnings assume that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses the values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and we believe ffo more accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts inc nareit as net income computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap excluding gains or losses on sales of operating properties and impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate assets plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis we believe that to further understand our performance ffo should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with gaap as presented in the consolidated financial statements 

the computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions

financing strategy 

we will continue to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts reviewed from time to time by our board of directors although our board of directors has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur we will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be 

either fixed or variable rate in making financing decisions we will consider factors including but not limited to 

• the interest rate of the proposed financing • the extent to which the financing impacts flexibility in managing our properties • prepayment penalties and restrictions on refinancing • the purchase price of properties acquired with debt financing • longterm objectives with respect to the financing • target investment returns • the ability of particular properties and our company as a whole to generate cash flow sufficient to cover expected debt service payments • overall level of consolidated indebtedness • timing of debt and lease maturities • provisions that require recourse and crosscollateralization • corporate credit ratios including debt service coverage debt to total capitalization and debt to undepreciated assets and • the overall ratio of fixed and variable rate debt our indebtedness may be recourse nonrecourse or crosscollateralized if the indebtedness is nonrecourse the collateral will be limited to the particular properties to which the indebtedness relates in addition we may invest in properties subject to existing loans collateralized by mortgages or similar liens on our properties or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis we may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness to refinance investments including the redevelopment of existing properties for general working capital or to purchase additional interests in partnerships or joint ventures or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable 

we may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt as well as shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our future income cash flows and fair values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary and tax policies domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 1958186 in total face value debt of which approximately 339302 was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt excluding variable rate debt with interest rate floors would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 3000 annually 

interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur further in the event of a change of that magnitude we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure

management 

members of our executive management team have significant experience in all aspects of the selfstorage industry having acquired andor developed a significant number of properties since before our ipo our executive management team and their years of industry experience are as follows spencer f kirk chief executive officer 15 years scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer 12 years karl haas executive vice president and chief operating officer 25 years charles l allen executive vice president and chief legal officer 15 years and kenneth m woolley executive chairman and chief investment officer 32 years 

our executive management team and board of directors have a significant ownership position in the company with executive officers and directors owning approximately 6119889 shares or 55 of our outstanding common stock as of february 15 2013 

industry  competition 

selfstorage facilities refers to properties that offer monthtomonth storage space rental for personal or business use selfstorage offers a costeffective and flexible storage alternative tenants rent fully enclosed spaces that can vary in size according to their specific needs and to which they have unlimited exclusive access tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units selfstorage unit sizes typically range from 5 feet by 5 feet to 20 feet by 20 feet with an interior height of 8 feet to 12 feet properties generally have onsite managers who supervise and run the daytoday operations providing tenants with assistance as needed 

selfstorage provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions due to life changes or simply because of a need for storage space the mix of residential tenants using a selfstorage property is determined by a propertys local demographics and often includes people who are looking to downsize their living space or others who are not yet settled into a permanent residence items that residential tenants place in selfstorage properties range from cars boats and recreational vehicles to furniture household items and appliances commercial tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods records inventory or storage for seasonal goods 

our research has shown that tenants choose a selfstorage property based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or business making highdensity hightraffic population centers ideal locations for selfstorage properties a propertys perceived security and the general professionalism of the site managers and staff are also contributing factors to a sites ability to successfully secure rentals although most selfstorage properties are leased to tenants on a monthtomonth basis tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time 

there are seasonal fluctuations in occupancy rates for selfstorage properties based on our experience generally there is increased leasing activity at selfstorage properties during the spring and summer months the highest level of occupancy is typically at the end of july while the lowest level of occupancy is seen in late february and early march 

since inception in the early 1970s the selfstorage industry has experienced significant growth according to the selfstorage almanac the almanac in 2002 there were only 35176 selfstorage properties in the united states with an average physical occupancy rate of 854 of net rentable square feet compared to 50859 selfstorage properties in 2012 with an average physical occupancy rate of 797 of net rentable square feet 

we have encountered competition when we have sought to acquire properties especially for brokered portfolios aggressive bidding practices have been commonplace between both public and private entities and this competition will likely continue 

the industry is also characterized by fragmented ownership according to the almanac the top ten selfstorage companies in the united states owned approximately 114 of total us selfstorage properties and the top 50 selfstorage companies owned approximately 151 of the total us properties as of december 31 2012 we believe this fragmentation will contribute to continued consolidation at some level in the future we also believe that we are well positioned to compete for acquisitions given our historical reputation for closing deals 

we are the second largest selfstorage operator in the united states we are one of four public selfstorage reits along with public storage inc sovran selfstorage inc and cubesmart 

longterm growth and investment strategies 

our primary business objectives are to maximize cash flow available for distribution to our stockholders and to achieve sustainable longterm growth in cash flow per share in order to maximize longterm stockholder value we continue to evaluate a range of growth initiatives and opportunities including the following 

• maximize the performance of properties through strategic efficient and proactive management we pursue revenuegenerating and expenseminimizing opportunities in our operations our revenue management team seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our technology systems ability to provide realtime interactive rental rate and discount management our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement national regional and local marketing programs which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost • acquire selfstorage properties from strategic partners and third parties our acquisitions team continues to pursue the acquisition of single properties and multiproperty portfolios that we believe can provide stockholder value we have established a reputation as a reliable ethical buyer which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions in addition we believe our status as an upreit enables flexibility when structuring deals we continue to see available acquisitions on which to bid and are seeing increasing prices however we remain a disciplined buyer and look for acquisitions that will strengthen our portfolio and increase stockholder value • expand our management business our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and expand our geographic footprint this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale in addition we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline we pursue strategic relationships with owners whose properties would enhance our portfolio in the event an opportunity arises to acquire such properties 5 

financing of our longterm growth strategies 

• acquisition and development financing   the following table presents information on our lines of credit the credit lines for the periods indicated amounts in thousands 



1 one year extension available 2 one twoyear extension available 3 two oneyear extensions available 4 guaranteed by the company 5 secured by mortgages on certain real estate assets 

we expect to maintain a flexible approach in financing new property acquisitions we plan to finance future acquisitions through a combination of cash borrowings under the credit lines traditional secured mortgage financing joint ventures and additional equity offerings 

• joint venture financing   we own 280 of our stabilized properties and one of our leaseup properties through joint ventures with third parties including affiliates of prudential financial inc in each joint venture we generally manage the daytoday operations of the underlying properties and have the right to participate in major decisions relating to sales of properties or financings by the applicable joint venture our joint venture partners typically provide most of the equity capital required for the operation of the respective business under the operating agreements for the joint ventures we maintain the right to receive between 20 and 583 of the available cash flow from operations after our joint venture partners and the company have received a predetermined return and between 170 and 650 of the available cash flow from capital transactions after our joint venture partners and the company have received a return of their capital plus such predetermined return most joint venture agreements include buysell rights as well as rights of first refusal in connection with the sale of properties by the joint venture 

• disposition of properties   we will continue to review our portfolio for properties or groups of properties that are not strategically located and determine whether to dispose of these properties to fund other growth 

regulation 

generally selfstorage properties are subject to various laws ordinances and regulations including regulations relating to lien sale rights and procedures changes in any of these laws or regulations as well as changes in laws such as the comprehensive environmental response and compensation 

liability act which increase the potential liability for environmental conditions or circumstances existing or created by tenants or others on properties or laws affecting development construction operation upkeep safety and taxation may result in significant unanticipated expenditures loss of selfstorage sites or other impairments to operations which would adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

under the americans with disabilities act of 1990 the ada places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these requirements became effective in 1992 a number of additional us federal state and local laws also exist that may require modifications to the properties or restrict further renovations thereof with respect to access thereto by disabled persons noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature thereby requiring substantial capital expenditures to the extent our properties are not in compliance we are likely to incur additional costs to comply with the ada 

insurance activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state in accordance with the mccarranferguson act and are subject to the grammleachbliley act and the privacy regulations promulgated by the federal trade commission pursuant thereto 

property management activities are often subject to state real estate brokerage laws and regulations as determined by the particular real estate commission for each state 

changes in any of the laws governing our conduct could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business or could materially affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

employees 

as of february 15 2013 we had 2283 employees and believe our relationship with our employees is good our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement 




 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our securities involves various risks all investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information contained in this annual report before trading in our securities if any of the events set forth in the following risks actually occur our business operating results prospects and financial condition could be harmed 

our performance is subject to risks associated with real estate investments we are a real estate company that derives our income from operation of our properties there are a number of factors that may adversely affect the income that our properties generate including the following 

risks related to our properties and operations 

adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating results 

our operating results are dependent upon our ability to maximize occupancy levels and rental rates in our selfstorage properties adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we operate may lower our occupancy levels and limit our ability to increase rents or require us to offer rental discounts if our properties fail to generate revenues sufficient to meet our cash requirements including operating and other expenses debt service and capital expenditures our net income funds from operations ffo cash flow financial condition ability to make cash distributions to 

stockholders and the trading price of our securities could be adversely affected the following factors among others may adversely affect the operating performance of our properties 

• the national economic climate and the local or regional economic climate in the markets in which we operate which may be adversely impacted by among other factors industry slowdowns relocation of businesses and changing demographics • periods of economic slowdown or recession rising interest rates or declining demand for selfstorage or the public perception that any of these events may occur could result in a general decline in rental rates or an increase in tenant defaults • a decline or worsening of the current economic environment • local or regional real estate market conditions such as competing properties the oversupply of selfstorage or a reduction in demand for selfstorage in a particular area • perceptions by prospective users of our selfstorage properties of the safety convenience and attractiveness of our properties and the neighborhoods in which they are located • increased operating costs including the need for capital improvements insurance premiums real estate taxes and utilities • the impact of environmental protection laws • earthquakes hurricanes and other natural disasters terrorist acts civil disturbances or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses and • changes in tax real estate and zoning laws if we are unable to promptly relet our units or if the rates upon such reletting are significantly lower than expected our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

virtually all of our leases are on a monthtomonth basis any delay in reletting units as vacancies arise would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results in addition lower than expected rental rates upon reletting could adversely affect our revenues and impede our growth 

we depend upon our onsite personnel to maximize tenant satisfaction at each of our properties and any difficulties we encounter in hiring training and maintaining skilled field personnel may harm our operating performance 

we had 1925 field personnel as of february 15 2013 in the management and operation of our properties the general professionalism of our site managers and staff are contributing factors to a sites ability to successfully secure rentals and retain tenants we also rely upon our field personnel to maintain clean and secure selfstorage properties if we are unable to successfully recruit train and retain qualified field personnel the quality of service we strive to provide at our properties could be adversely affected which could lead to decreased occupancy levels and reduced operating performance 

uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flow 

we maintain comprehensive liability fire flood earthquake wind as deemed necessary or as required by our lenders extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our properties certain types of losses however may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable such as losses due to earthquakes hurricanes tornadoes riots acts of war or terrorism should an uninsured loss occur we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a property in addition if any such loss is insured we may be required to pay significant amounts on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to our insurer being obligated to reimburse us for the loss or the amount of the loss may exceed our coverage for the loss as a result our operating results may be adversely affected 

increases in taxes and regulatory compliance costs may reduce our income 

costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws generally are not passed through to tenants directly and will affect us increases in income property or other taxes generally are not passed through to tenants under leases and may reduce our net income ffo cash flow financial condition ability to pay or refinance our debt obligations ability to make cash distributions to stockholders and the trading price of our securities similarly changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which could similarly adversely affect our business and results of operations 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our properties may affect our results of operations 

under various us federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations owners and operators of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigating and remediating certain hazardous substances or other regulated materials on or in such property such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such substances or materials the presence of such substances or materials or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owners or operators ability to lease sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances or other regulated materials may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials into the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with asbestoscontaining materials 

certain environmental laws also impose liability without regard to knowledge or fault for removal or remediation of hazardous substances or other regulated materials upon owners and operators of contaminated property even after they no longer own or operate the property moreover the past or present owner or operator from which a release emanates could be liable for any personal injuries or property damages that may result from such releases as well as any damages to natural resources that may arise from such releases 

certain environmental laws impose compliance obligations on owners and operators of real property with respect to the management of hazardous materials and other regulated substances for example environmental laws govern the management of asbestoscontaining materials and leadbased paint failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties or other sanctions 

no assurances can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner or operator of our properties did not create any material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our properties there also exists the risk that material environmental conditions liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future finally future laws ordinances or regulations and future interpretations of existing laws ordinances or regulations may impose additional material environmental liability 

costs associated with complying with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 may result in unanticipated expenses 

under the ada places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these requirements became effective in 1992 a number of additional us federal state and local laws may also require modifications to our properties or restrict certain further renovations of the properties with respect to access thereto by disabled persons noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of 

damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature which could result in substantial capital expenditures we have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine our compliance and we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with the ada or other legislation if one or more of our properties is not in compliance with the ada or other legislation then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the facility into compliance if we incur substantial costs to comply with the ada or other legislation our financial condition results of operations cash flow per share trading price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make cash distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected 

our tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation which may adversely affect our results 

our tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation the regulatory authorities generally have broad discretion to grant renew and revoke licenses and approvals to promulgate interpret and implement regulations and to evaluate compliance with regulations through periodic examinations audits and investigations of the affairs of insurance providers as a result of regulatory or private action in any jurisdiction we may be temporarily or permanently suspended from continuing some or all of our reinsurance activities or otherwise fined or penalized or suffer an adverse judgment which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we face competition for the acquisition of selfstorage properties and other assets which may impede our ability to make future acquisitions or may increase the cost of these acquisitions 

we compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of selfstorage properties and other assets including national regional and local operators and developers of selfstorage properties these competitors may drive up the price we pay for selfstorage properties or other assets we seek to acquire or may succeed in acquiring those properties or assets themselves in addition our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive suitors because they may have greater resources may be willing to pay more or may have a more compatible operating philosophy in addition the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment properties may increase this competition would result in increased demand for these assets and therefore increased prices paid for them because of an increased interest in single property acquisitions among taxmotivated individual purchasers we may pay higher prices if we purchase single properties in comparison with portfolio acquisitions if we pay higher prices for selfstorage properties or other assets our profitability will be reduced 

we may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria which may impede our growth 

our ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy we may not be successful in identifying suitable properties or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms or at all failure to identify or consummate acquisitions will slow our growth which could in turn adversely affect our stock price 

our ability to acquire properties on favorable terms and successfully integrate and operate them may be constrained by the following significant risks 

• competition from local investors and other real estate investors with significant capital including other publiclytraded reits and institutional investment funds • competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price which could reduce our profitability 10 

• the inability to achieve satisfactory completion of due diligence investigations and other customary closing conditions • failure to finance an acquisition on favorable terms or at all • we may spend more than the time and amounts budgeted to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties and • we may acquire properties subject to liabilities without any recourse or with only limited recourse with respect to unknown liabilities such as liabilities for cleanup of undisclosed environmental contamination claims by persons dealing with the former owners of the properties and claims for indemnification by general partners directors officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties in addition strategic decisions by us such as acquisitions may adversely affect the price of our securities 

we may not be successful in integrating and operating acquired properties 

we expect to make future acquisitions of selfstorage properties if we acquire any selfstorage properties we will be required to integrate them into our existing portfolio the acquired properties may turn out to be less compatible with our growth strategy than originally anticipated may cause disruptions in our operations or may divert managements attention away from daytoday operations which could impair our operating results as a whole 

we do not always obtain independent appraisals of our properties and thus the consideration paid for these properties may exceed the value that may be indicated by thirdparty appraisals 

we do not always obtain thirdparty appraisals in connection with our acquisition of properties and the consideration being paid by us in exchange for those properties may exceed the value determined by thirdparty appraisals in such cases the value of the properties was determined by our senior management team 

our investments in development and redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns which would harm our operating results and reduce the amount of funds available for distributions 

to the extent that we engage in development and redevelopment activities we will be subject to the following risks normally associated with these projects 

• we may be unable to obtain financing for these projects on favorable terms or at all • we may not complete development or redevelopment projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts • we may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning land use building occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations and • occupancy rates and rents at newly developed or redeveloped properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors including market and economic conditions and may result in our investment not being profitable in deciding whether to develop or redevelop a particular property we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring the property up to the standards established for its intended market position or may be unable to increase occupancy at a newly developed property as quickly as expected or at all any substantial unanticipated delays or expenses could adversely affect the investment returns from these development or redevelopment projects and harm our operating results liquidity and financial condition which could result in a decline in the value of our securities 

we may rely on the investments of our joint venture partners for funding certain of our development and redevelopment projects if our reputation in the selfstorage industry changes or the number of investors considering us an attractive strategic partner is otherwise reduced our ability to develop or redevelop properties could be affected which would limit our growth 

risks related to our organization and structure 

our business could be harmed if key personnel with longstanding business relationships in the selfstorage industry terminate their employment with us 

our success depends on the continued services of members of our executive management team who have substantial experience in the selfstorage industry in addition our ability to acquire or develop properties in the future depends on the significant relationships our executive management team has developed with our institutional joint venture partners such as affiliates of prudential financial inc there is no guarantee that any of them will remain employed by us we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers the loss of services of one or more members of our executive management team could harm our business and our prospects 

we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business without stockholder consent which may subject us to different risks 

we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business at any time without the consent of our stockholders which could result in our making investments and engaging in business activities that are different from and possibly riskier than the investments and businesses described in this document a change in our investment strategy or our entry into new lines of business may increase our exposure to other risks or real estate market fluctuations 

if other selfstorage companies convert to an upreit structure or if tax laws change we may no longer have an advantage in competing for potential acquisitions 

because we are structured as an upreit we are a more attractive acquirer of properties to taxmotivated sellers than our competitors that are not structured as upreits however if other selfstorage companies restructure their holdings to become upreits this competitive advantage will disappear in addition new legislation may be enacted or new interpretations of existing legislation may be issued by the internal revenue service irs or the us treasury department that could affect the attractiveness of our upreit structure so that it may no longer assist us in competing for acquisitions 

tax indemnification obligations may require the operating partnership to maintain certain debt levels 

we have provided certain tax protections to various third parties in connection with their property contributions to the operating partnership upon acquisition by the company including making available the opportunity to 1 guarantee debt or 2 enter into a special loss allocation and deficit restoration obligation we have agreed to these provisions in order to assist these contributors in preserving their tax position after their contributions these obligations may require us to maintain certain indebtedness levels that we would not otherwise require for our business 

our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority 

as of december 31 2012 we held interests in 281 operating properties through joint ventures some of these arrangements could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority our reliance on coventurers financial conditions and disputes between us and our coventurers we expect to continue our joint venture strategy by entering into more joint ventures for the purpose of developing new selfstorage properties and acquiring existing properties in such event we would not be in a position to exercise sole decisionmaking authority regarding the property partnership joint venture or other entity the decisionmaking authority regarding the properties we currently hold 

through joint ventures is either vested exclusively with our joint venture partners is subject to a majority vote of the joint venture partners or equally shared by us and the joint venture partners in addition investments in partnerships joint ventures or other entities may under certain circumstances involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or coventurers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions partners or coventurers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions such as a sale because neither we nor the partner or coventurer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or coventurers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers andor directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or coventurers might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our thirdparty partners or coventurers which could harm our financial condition 

conflicts of interest could arise as a result of our relationship with our operating partnership 

conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates and our operating partnership or any partner thereof our directors and officers have duties to our company under applicable maryland law in connection with their management of our company at the same time we through our whollyowned subsidiary have fiduciary duties as a general partner to our operating partnership and to the limited partners under delaware law in connection with the management of our operating partnership our duties through our whollyowned subsidiary as a general partner to our operating partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our company the partnership agreement of our operating partnership does not require us to resolve such conflicts in favor of either our company or the limited partners in our operating partnership unless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement delaware law generally requires a general partner of a delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith fairness and loyalty and which generally prohibit such general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest 

additionally the partnership agreement expressly limits our liability by providing that neither we our direct whollyowned massachusetts business trust subsidiary as the general partner of the operating partnership nor any of our or their trustees directors or officers will be liable or accountable in damages to our operating partnership the limited partners or assignees for errors in judgment mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if we or such trustee director or officer acted in good faith in addition our operating partnership is required to indemnify us our affiliates and each of our respective trustees officers directors employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against any and all losses claims damages liabilities whether joint or several expenses including without limitation attorneys fees and other legal fees and expenses judgments fines settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims demands actions suits or proceedings civil criminal administrative or investigative that relate to the operations of the operating partnership provided that our operating partnership will not indemnify for 1 willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law 2 any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement or 3 in the case of a criminal proceeding the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful 

the provisions of delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that 

purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement 

certain provisions of maryland law and our organizational documents including the stock ownership limit imposed by our charter may inhibit market activity in our stock and could prevent or delay a change in control transaction 

our charter subject to certain exceptions authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a reit and to limit any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding common stock or 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limit however our board of directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership limit to any proposed transferee whose ownership could jeopardize our qualification as a reit these restrictions on ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the ownership limit may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders different ownership limits apply to the family of kenneth m woolley certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing to spencer f kirk certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and to certain designated investment entities as defined in our charter 

our board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder approval in addition our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares our board of directors could issue additional shares of our common stock or establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise not be in the best interests of our stockholders 

our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited 

maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances in addition our charter eliminates our directors and officers liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law as a result we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law in addition we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers 

to the extent our distributions represent a return of capital for us federal income tax purposes our stockholders could recognize an increased capital gain upon a subsequent sale of common stock 

distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and not treated by us as a dividend will not be taxable to a us stockholder under current us federal income tax law to the extent those distributions do not exceed the stockholders adjusted tax basis in his her or its common 

stock but instead will constitute a return of capital and will reduce such adjusted basis if distributions result in a reduction of a stockholders adjusted basis in such holders common stock subsequent sales of such holders common stock will result in recognition of an increased capital gain or decreased capital loss due to the reduction in such adjusted basis 

risks related to the real estate industry 

our primary business involves the ownership and operation of selfstorage properties 

our current strategy is to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop only selfstorage properties consequently we are subject to risks inherent in investments in a single industry because investments in real estate are inherently illiquid this strategy makes it difficult for us to diversify our investment portfolio and to limit our risk when economic conditions change decreases in market rents negative tax real estate and zoning law changes and changes in environmental protection laws may also increase our costs lower the value of our investments and decrease our income which would adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties 

because real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in our portfolio in response to changing economic financial and investment conditions is limited the real estate market is affected by many factors such as general economic conditions availability of financing interest rates and other factors including supply and demand that are beyond our control we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property 

we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold we cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements in acquiring a property we may agree to transfer restrictions that materially restrict us from selling that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property these transfer restrictions would impede our ability to sell a property even if we deem it necessary or appropriate 

any investments in unimproved real property may take significantly longer to yield incomeproducing returns if at all and may result in additional costs to us to comply with rezoning restrictions or environmental regulations 

we have invested in the past and may invest in the future in unimproved real property unimproved properties generally take longer to yield incomeproducing returns based on the typical time required for development any development of unimproved property may also expose us to the risks and uncertainties associated with rezoning the land for a higher use or development and environmental concerns of governmental entities andor community groups any unsuccessful investments or delays in realizing an incomeproducing return or increased costs to develop unimproved real estate could restrict our ability to earn our targeted rate of return on an investment or adversely affect our ability to pay operating expenses which would harm our financial condition and operating results 

any negative perceptions of the selfstorage industry generally may result in a decline in our stock price 

to the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the selfstorage industry the value of our securities may be negatively impacted which could result in our securities trading below the inherent value of our assets 

risks related to our debt financings 

disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us 

uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to refinance existing debt maturities on favorable terms or at all which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions and fund development projects a downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing 

required payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our properties or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations 

as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 16 billion of outstanding indebtedness we may incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions and development we may borrow under our credit lines or borrow new funds to finance these future properties additionally we do not anticipate that our internally generated cash flow will be adequate to repay our existing indebtedness upon maturity and therefore we expect to repay our indebtedness through refinancings and equity andor debt offerings further we may need to borrow funds in order to make cash distributions to maintain our qualification as a reit or to make our expected distributions 

if we are required to utilize our credit lines for purposes other than acquisition activity this will reduce the amount available for acquisitions and could slow our growth therefore our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences including the following 

• our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments • we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms including to make acquisitions or to continue to make distributions required to maintain our qualification as a reit • we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness • because a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates an increase in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense • we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties possibly on disadvantageous terms • after debt service the amount available for cash distributions to our stockholders is reduced • our debt level could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt • we may experience increased vulnerability to economic and industry downturns reducing our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions • we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases • we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgages may enforce our guarantees 16 

• we may violate restrictive covenants in our loan documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations and • our default under any one of our mortgage loans with crossdefault or crosscollateralization provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness or result in the foreclosures of other properties we could become highly leveraged in the future because our organizational documents contain no limitation on the amount of debt we may incur 

our organizational documents contain no limitations on the amount of indebtedness that we or our operating partnership may incur we could alter the balance between our total outstanding indebtedness and the value of our portfolio at any time if we become more highly leveraged the resulting increase in debt service could adversely affect our ability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness and to pay our anticipated cash distributions andor to continue to make cash distributions to maintain our reit qualification and could harm our financial condition 

increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and make cash distributions to our stockholders 

as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 16 billion of debt outstanding of which approximately 2987 million or 190 was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps this variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 23 per annum increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase our interest expense which could harm our cash flow and our ability to pay cash distributions for example if market rates of interest on this variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points excluding variable rate debt with interest rate floors the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 26 million annually 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations 

in certain cases we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements hedging involves risks such as the risk that the counterparty may fail to honor its obligations under an arrangement failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders 

risks related to qualification and operation as a reit 

to maintain our qualification as a reit we may be forced to borrow funds on a shortterm basis during unfavorable market conditions 

to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our net taxable income each year excluding net capital gains and we are subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income each year in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions made by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years while historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances its own stock assuming we continue to satisfy these distributions requirements with cash we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis or possibly longterm to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these borrowing needs could result from a difference in timing between the actual receipt 

of cash and inclusion of income for us federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt amortization payments 

dividends payable by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates 

the maximum us federal income tax rate for dividends paid by domestic corporations to individual us stockholders is 15 through 2012 dividends paid by reits however are generally not eligible for the reduced rates the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause stockholders who are individuals to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits including our securities 

in addition the relative attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends which could negatively affect the value of our properties 

possible legislative or other actions affecting reits could adversely affect our stockholders 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us treasury department changes to tax laws which changes may have retroactive application could adversely affect our stockholders it cannot be predicted whether when in what forms or with what effective dates the tax laws applicable to us or our stockholders will be changed 

the power of our board of directors to revoke our reit election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders 

our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election without the approval of our stockholders if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a reit if we cease to qualify as a reit we would become subject to us federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our net taxable income to our stockholders which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholders 

our failure to qualify as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock 

we believe we operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit or lose our qualification as a reit at any time we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution for each of the years involved because 

• we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates • we also could be subject to the us federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes and • unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following a year during which we were disqualified in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits this means that our us individual stockholders would be taxed on our dividends at capital gains rates and our us corporate 

stockholders would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends subject in each case to applicable limitations under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and are able to avail ourselves of one or more of the relief provisions under the internal revenue code in order to maintain our reit status we may nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of 50000 or more for each such failure as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our securities 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the internal revenue code is greater in the case of a reit that like us holds its assets through a partnership the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the composition of our assets the sources of our gross income and the owners of our stock our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market value of our assets some of which are not susceptible to precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our net taxable income excluding capital gains and we will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income including capital gains in addition legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors our ability to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that is intended to allow us to qualify for taxation as a reit we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the internal revenue service regarding our qualification as a reit 

we will pay some taxes 

even though we qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we will be required to pay some us federal state and local taxes on our income and property extra space management inc manages selfstorage properties for our joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties we jointly with extra space management inc elected to treat extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary trs of our company for us federal income tax purposes a taxable reit subsidiary is a fully taxable corporation and may be limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to us esm reinsurance limited a whollyowned subsidiary of extra space management inc generates income from insurance premiums that are subject to federal income tax and state insurance premiums tax in addition we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements among our tenants our taxable reit subsidiary and us are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties or if we receive payments for inventory or property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business also if we sell property as a dealer ie to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on any gain arising from such sales while we dont intend to sell properties as a dealer the irs could take a contrary position to the extent that we are or our taxable reit subsidiary is required to pay us federal state or local taxes we will have less cash available for distribution to stockholders 

complying with reit requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 

to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the nature and diversification of our assets the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock in order to meet these tests we may be required to forego attractive business or investment opportunities thus compliance with the reit requirements may adversely affect our ability to operate solely to maximize profits

 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2012 we owned or had ownership interests in 729 operating selfstorage properties of these properties 448 are whollyowned and 281 are held in joint ventures in addition we managed an additional 181 properties for third parties bringing the total number of properties which we own andor manage to 910 these properties are located in 34 states washington dc and puerto rico we receive a management fee generally equal to approximately 6 of cash collected from total revenues to manage the joint venture and third party sites as of december 31 2012 we owned andor managed approximately 670 million square feet of rentable space configured in approximately 610000 separate storage units approximately 81 of our properties are clustered around large population centers such as atlanta baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas houston las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san franciscooakland these markets contain aboveaverage population and income demographics for new selfstorage properties the clustering of assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale our acquisitions have given us an increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in many markets where we had no previous presence 

we consider a property to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization we consider a property to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 or has been open for three years 

as of december 31 2012 over 490000 tenants were leasing storage units at the 910 operating properties that we own andor manage primarily on a monthtomonth basis providing the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit although leases are shortterm in duration the typical tenant tends to remain at our properties for an extended period of time for properties that were stabilized as of december 31 2012 the average length of stay was approximately 13 months the average annual rent per square foot at these stabilized properties was approximately 1388 at december 31 2012 compared to 1350 at december 31 2011 

our property portfolio is made up of different types of construction and building configurations depending on the site and the municipality where it is located most often sites are what we consider hybrid facilities a mix of both driveup buildings and multifloor buildings we have a number of multifloor buildings with elevator access only and a number of facilities featuring groundfloor access only

overview 

we are a fully integrated selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust or reit formed to continue the business commenced in 1977 by our predecessor companies to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop professionally managed selfstorage properties 

at december 31 2012 we owned had ownership interests in or managed 910 operating properties in 34 states washington dc and puerto rico of these 910 operating properties we owned 448 we held joint venture interests in 281 properties and our taxable reit subsidiary extra space management inc operated an additional 181 properties that are owned by third parties these operating properties contain approximately 670 million square feet of rentable space in approximately 610000 units and currently serve a customer base of over 490000 tenants 

our properties are generally situated in convenient highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as atlanta baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas houston las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san franciscooakland these areas all enjoy above average population growth and income levels the clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale we consider a property to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization a property is considered to be stabilized once it has achieved an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 or has been open for three years 

to maximize the performance of our properties we employ stateoftheart webbased tracking and yield management technology and an industryleading revenue management system developed by our management team these systems enable us to analyze set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions we believe our systems and processes allow us to more proactively manage revenues 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under existing leases at each of our whollyowned selfstorage properties from management fees on the properties we manage for jointventure partners and unaffiliated third parties and from our tenant reinsurance program our management fee is generally equal to approximately 6 of cash collected from total revenues generated by the managed properties we also receive an asset management fee of 05 of the total asset value from one of our joint ventures 

we operate in competitive markets often where consumers have multiple selfstorage properties from which to choose competition has impacted and will continue to impact our property results we experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity our operating results depend materially on our ability to lease available selfstorage units to actively manage unit rental rates and on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments we believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the use of our systems 

we continue to evaluate and implement a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to enable us to maximize stockholder value our strategies to maximize stockholder value include the following 

• maximize the performance of properties through strategic efficient and proactive management we pursue revenuegenerating and expenseminimizing opportunities in our operations our revenue management team seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our technology systems ability to provide realtime interactive rental rate and discount management our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement national regional and local marketing programs which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost • acquire selfstorage properties from strategic partners and third parties our acquisitions team continues to pursue the acquisition of single properties and multiproperty portfolios that we believe can provide stockholder value we have established a reputation as a reliable ethical buyer which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions in addition we believe our status as an upreit enables flexibility when structuring deals we continue to see available acquisitions on which to bid and are seeing increasing prices however we remain a disciplined buyer and look for acquisitions that will strengthen our portfolio and increase stockholder value • expand our management business our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and expand our geographic footprint this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale in addition we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline we pursue strategic relationships with owners whose properties would enhance our portfolio in the event an opportunity arises to acquire the properties during 2012 we acquired 91 whollyowned properties and completed the development of one whollyowned property 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those that impact our most critical accounting policies we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies 

consolidation arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as variable interest entities vies an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it is the primary beneficiary of the vie 

a vie is created when i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii the entitys equity holders as a group either a lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance b are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur or c do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur if an entity is deemed to be a vie the enterprise that is deemed to have a variable interest or combination of variable interests that provides the 

enterprise with a controlling financial interest in the vie is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 

we have concluded that under certain circumstances when we 1 enter into option agreements for the purchase of land or facilities from an entity and pay a nonrefundable deposit or 2 enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures a vie may be created under condition i ii b or c of the previous paragraph for each vie created we have performed a qualitative analysis including considering which party if any has the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of each vie and whether that party has the obligation to absorb losses of the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could be significant to the vie if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie the assets liabilities and operations of the vie are consolidated with our financial statements as of december 31 2012 the company had no consolidated vies additionally our operating partnership has notes payable to three trusts that are vies under condition iia above since the operating partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts these vies are not consolidated 

real estate assets real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation direct and allowable internal costs associated with the development construction renovation and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized interest property taxes and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized 

expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives depreciation is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements which are generally between 5 and 39 years 

in connection with our acquisition of properties the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values which are estimated using significant unobservable inputs the value of the tangible assets consisting of land and buildings are determined as if vacant intangible assets which represent the value of existing tenant relationships are recorded at their fair values based on the avoided cost to replace the current leases we measure the value of tenant relationships based on the rent lost due to the amount of time required to replace existing customers which is based on our historical experience with turnover in our facilities debt assumed as part of an acquisition is recorded at fair value based on current interest rates compared to contractual rates acquisitionrelated transaction costs are expensed as incurred 

intangible lease rights include 1 purchase price amounts allocated to leases on three properties that cannot be classified as ground or building leases these rights are amortized to expense over the term of the leases and 2 intangibles related to ground leases on five properties where the ground leases were assumed by the company at rates that were different than the current market rates for similar leases the value associated with these assumed leases were recorded as intangibles which will be amortized over the lease terms 

evaluation of asset impairment we evaluate long lived assets held for use when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment we review each property at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist we focus on properties where occupancy andor rental income have decreased by a significant amount for these properties we determine whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the property will likely recover the lost occupancy andor revenue in the short term in addition we carefully review properties in the leaseup stage and compare actual operating results to original projections 

when we determine that an event that may indicate impairment has occurred we compare the carrying value of the related longlived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets an impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the assets exceeds 

the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the assets 

when real estate assets are identified as held for sale we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the fair value of the assets net of selling costs if the estimated fair values net of selling costs of the assets that have been identified for sale are less than the net carrying value of the assets a valuation allowance is established the operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are generally presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

investments in real estate ventures our investments in real estate joint ventures where we have significant influence but not control and joint ventures which are vies in which we are not the primary beneficiary are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

under the equity method our investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures for the purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows we follow the look through approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures under this approach distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital eg a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint ventures sale of assets in which case it is reported as an investing activity 

our management assesses annually whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired and when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment an investment is impaired if managements estimate of the fair value of the investment using significant unobservable inputs is less than its carrying value to the extent impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment 

derivative instruments and hedging activities the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk are considered fair value hedges derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges 

for derivatives designated as fair value hedges changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings 

revenue and expense recognition rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants leases are generally on monthtomonth terms prepaid rents are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the leases promotional discounts are recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period late charges administrative fees merchandise sales and truck rentals are recognized in income when earned management fee revenues are recognized monthly as services are performed and in accordance with the terms of the related management agreements tenant reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenues over the period of insurance coverage equity in earnings of real estate entities is recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate entities interest income is recognized as earned 

property expenses including utilities property taxes repairs and maintenance and other costs to manage the facilities are recognized as incurred we accrue for property tax expense based upon invoice amounts estimates and historical trends if these estimates are incorrect the timing of expense recognition could be affected 

income taxes we have elected to be treated as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code in order to maintain our qualification as a reit among other things we are required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets as a reit we are not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to our stockholders we plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex if we were to fail to meet these requirements we would be subject to federal income tax we are subject to certain state and local taxes provision for such taxes has been included in income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

we have elected to treat one of our corporate subsidiaries extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary trs in general our trs may perform additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or nonreal estate related business a trs is subject to corporate federal income tax deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense when incurred 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in july 2012 the financial accounting standards board issued asu no 201202  testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment  asu 201202 which provides companies with the option to first assess qualitative factors in determining whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if after assessing the totality of events and circumstances an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired then the entity is not required to take further action however if an entity concludes otherwise then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value previously companies were required to perform the quantitative impairment test at least annually as permitted we adopted these provisions in 2012 the adoption of asu 201202 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

funds from operations 

ffo provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary along with net income and cash flows for an understanding of our operating results we believe ffo is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings net earnings assume that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses the values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and we believe ffo more accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts inc nareit as net income computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap excluding gains or losses on sales of operating properties and impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate assets plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis we believe that to further understand our performance ffo should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with gaap as presented in the consolidated financial statements 

the computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance as an alternative to net cash flow from 

operating activities as a measure of our liquidity or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions the following table presents the calculation of ffo for the periods indicated

our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts during 2012 we experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash or cash equivalents however there can be no assurance that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 

the following table presents information on our lines of credit 



1 one year extension available 2 one twoyear extension available 3 two oneyear extensions available 4 guaranteed by the company 5 secured by mortgages on certain real estate assets 

as of december 31 2012 we had 1574280 of debt resulting in a debt to total capitalization ratio of 275 as of december 31 2012 the ratio of total fixed rate debt and other instruments to total debt was 810 including 776381 on which we have interest rate swaps that have been included as fixedrate debt the weighted average interest rate of the total of fixed and variable rate debt at december 31 2012 was 42 certain of our real estate assets are pledged as collateral for our debt we are subject to certain restrictive covenants relating to our outstanding debt we were in compliance with all financial covenants at december 31 2012 

we expect to fund our shortterm liquidity requirements including operating expenses recurring capital expenditures dividends to stockholders distributions to holders of op units and interest on our outstanding indebtedness out of our operating cash flow cash on hand and borrowings under our credit lines in addition we are pursuing additional term loans secured by unencumbered properties 

our liquidity needs consist primarily of cash distributions to stockholders property acquisitions principal payments under our borrowings and nonrecurring capital expenditures we may from time to time seek to repurchase our outstanding debt shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors in addition we evaluate on an ongoing basis the merits of strategic acquisitions and other relationships which may require us to raise additional funds we do not expect that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs and instead expect to fund such needs out of additional borrowings of secured or unsecured indebtedness joint ventures with third parties and from the proceeds of public and private offerings of equity and debt additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all any additional issuance of equity or equitylinked securities may result in dilution to our stockholders in addition any new securities we issue could have rights preferences and privileges senior to holders of our common stock we may also use op units as currency to fund acquisitions from selfstorage owners who desire taxdeferral in their exiting transactions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes further except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitments or intent to provide funding to any such entities accordingly we are not materially exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships

as of december 31 2012 the weighted average interest rate for all fixed rate loans was 46 and the weighted average interest rate on all variable rate loans was 23 

financing strategy 

we will continue to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts reviewed from time to time by our board of directors although our board of directors has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur we will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or variable rate in making financing decisions we will consider factors including but not limited to 

• the interest rate of the proposed financing • the extent to which the financing impacts flexibility in managing our properties • prepayment penalties and restrictions on refinancing • the purchase price of properties acquired with debt financing • longterm objectives with respect to the financing • target investment returns • the ability of particular properties and our company as a whole to generate cash flow sufficient to cover expected debt service payments • overall level of consolidated indebtedness • timing of debt and lease maturities 45 

• provisions that require recourse and crosscollateralization • corporate credit ratios including debt service coverage debt to total capitalization and debt to undepreciated assets and • the overall ratio of fixed and variable rate debt our indebtedness may be recourse nonrecourse or crosscollateralized if the indebtedness is nonrecourse the collateral will be limited to the particular properties to which the indebtedness relates in addition we may invest in properties subject to existing loans collateralized by mortgages or similar liens on our properties or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis we may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness to refinance investments including the redevelopment of existing properties for general working capital or to purchase additional interests in partnerships or joint ventures or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable 

we may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt as well as shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

seasonality 

the selfstorage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations a greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from may through september historically our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of july while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early march results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our future income cash flows and fair values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary and tax policies domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 1574280 in total debt of which approximately 298675 was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt excluding variable rate debt with interest rate floors would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 2600 annually 

interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur further in the event of a change of that magnitude we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure

management 

members of our executive management team have significant experience in all aspects of the selfstorage industry the senior management team has collectively acquired andor developed 595 properties since our ipo our executive management team and their years of industry experience are as follows spencer f kirk chairman and chief executive officer 14 years p scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer 11 years charles l allen executive vice president and chief legal officer 14 years and karl haas executive vice president and chief operating officer 24 years 

members of the executive management team have guided the company through substantial growth developing and acquiring over 44 billion in assets since 1996 this growth has been funded through public equity offerings and private equity capital this private equity capital has come primarily from sophisticated high networth individuals and institutional investors such as affiliates of prudential financial inc and fidelity investments 

our executive management and board of directors have a significant ownership position in the company with executive officers and directors owning approximately 6480191 shares or 68 of our outstanding common stock as of february 15 2012 

industry  competition 

selfstorage facilities refers to properties that offer monthtomonth storage space rental for personal or business use selfstorage offers a costeffective and flexible storage alternative tenants rent fully enclosed spaces that can vary in size according to their specific needs and to which they have unlimited exclusive access tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units selfstorage unit sizes typically range from five feet by five feet to 20 feet by 20 feet with an interior height of eight to 12 feet properties generally have onsite managers who supervise and run the daytoday operations providing tenants with assistance as needed 

selfstorage provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions due to life changes or simply because of a need for storage space the mix of residential tenants using a selfstorage property is determined by a propertys local demographics and often includes people who are looking to downsize their living space or others who are not yet settled into a permanent residence items that residential tenants place in selfstorage properties range from cars boats and recreational vehicles to furniture household items and appliances commercial tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods records inventory or storage for seasonal goods 

our research has shown that tenants choose a selfstorage property based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or business making highdensity hightraffic population centers ideal locations for selfstorage properties a propertys perceived security and the general professionalism of the site managers and staff are also contributing factors to a sites ability to successfully secure rentals although most selfstorage properties are leased to tenants on a monthtomonth basis tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time 

there are seasonal fluctuations in occupancy rates for selfstorage properties based on our experience generally there is increased leasing activity at selfstorage properties during the spring and summer months the highest level of occupancy is typically at the end of july while the lowest level of occupancy is seen in late february and early march 

since inception in the early 1970s the selfstorage industry has experienced significant growth in the past few years there has been even greater growth according to the selfstorage almanac the almanac in 2001 there were only 33833 selfstorage properties in the united states with an average occupancy rate of 861 of net rentable square feet compared to 50048 selfstorage properties in 2011 with an average occupancy rate of 797 of net rentable square feet 

we have encountered competition when we have sought to acquire properties especially for brokered portfolios aggressive bidding practices have been commonplace between both public and private entities and this competition will likely continue 

the industry is also characterized by fragmented ownership according to the almanac the top ten selfstorage companies in the united states owned approximately 111 of total us selfstorage properties and the top 50 selfstorage companies owned approximately 151 of the total us properties as of december 31 2011 we believe this fragmentation will contribute to continued consolidation at some level in the future we also believe that we are well positioned to compete for acquisitions given our historical reputation for closing deals 

we are the second largest selfstorage operator in the united states we are one of four public selfstorage reits along with public storage inc sovran selfstorage inc and cubesmart 

longterm growth and investment strategies 

our primary business objectives are to maximize cash flow available for distribution to our stockholders and to achieve sustainable longterm growth in cash flow per share in order to maximize longterm stockholder value we continue to evaluate a range of growth initiatives and opportunities including the following 

• maximize the performance of properties through strategic efficient and proactive management we pursue revenuegenerating and expense minimizing opportunities in our operations our revenue management team seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our technology systems ability to provide realtime interactive rental rate and discount management our size allows us greater ability than most of our competitors to implement national regional and local marketing programs which we believe attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost • acquire selfstorage properties from strategic partners and third parties our acquisitions team continues to pursue the acquisition of single properties and multiproperty portfolios that we believe can provide stockholder value we have established a reputation as a reliable ethical buyer which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions in addition we believe our status as an upreit enables flexibility when structuring deals • expand our management business our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and expand our geographic footprint this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale in addition we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline we pursue strategic relationships with owners that strengthen our acquisition pipeline through agreements which typically give us first right of refusal to purchase the managed property in the event of a potential sale 5 

financing of our longterm growth strategies 

• acquisition and development financing the following table sets forth information on our lines of credit the credit lines for the periods indicated amounts in thousands 



1 one year extension available 2 one twoyear extension available 3 two oneyear extensions available 4 guaranteed by the company 5 secured by mortgages on certain real estate assets 

we expect to maintain a flexible approach in financing new property acquisitions we plan to finance future acquisitions and development through a combination of cash borrowings under the credit lines traditional secured mortgage financing joint ventures and additional equity offerings 

• joint venture financing we own 336 of our stabilized properties and five of our leaseup properties through joint ventures with third parties including affiliates of prudential financial inc in each joint venture we generally manage the daytoday operations of the underlying properties and have the right to participate in major decisions relating to sales of properties or financings by the applicable joint venture our joint venture partners typically provide most of the equity capital required for the operation of the respective business under the operating agreements for the joint ventures we typically maintain the right to receive between 20 and 600 of the available cash flow from operations after our joint venture partners and the company have received a predetermined return and between 170 and 500 of the available cash flow from capital transactions after our joint venture partners and the company have received a return of their capital plus such predetermined return most joint venture agreements include buysell rights as well as rights of first refusal in connection with the sale of properties by the joint venture 

• disposition of properties we will continue to review our portfolio for properties or groups of properties that are not strategically located and determine whether to dispose of these properties to fund other growth 

regulation 

generally selfstorage properties are subject to various laws ordinances and regulations including regulations relating to lien sale rights and procedures changes in any of these laws or regulations as well as changes in laws such as the comprehensive environmental response and compensation liability act which increase the potential liability for environmental conditions or circumstances existing or created by tenants or others on properties or laws affecting development construction operation upkeep safety and taxation may result in significant unanticipated expenditures loss of selfstorage sites or other impairments to operations which would adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

under the americans with disabilities act of 1990 the ada places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these requirements became effective in 1992 a number of additional us federal state and local laws also exist that may require modifications to the properties or restrict further renovations thereof with respect to access thereto by disabled persons noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature thereby requiring substantial capital expenditures to the extent our properties are not in compliance we are likely to incur additional costs to comply with the ada 

insurance activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state in accordance with the mccarranferguson act and are subject to the grammleachbliley act and the privacy regulations promulgated by the federal trade commission pursuant thereto 

property management activities are often subject to state real estate brokerage laws and regulations as determined by the particular real estate commission for each state 

changes in any of the laws governing our conduct could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business or could materially affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

employees 

as of february 15 2012 we had 2239 employees and believe our relationship with our employees is good our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement 




 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our securities involves various risks all investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information contained in this annual report before trading in our securities if any of the events set forth in the following risks actually occur our business operating results prospects and financial condition could be harmed 

our performance is subject to risks associated with real estate investments we are a real estate company that derives our income from operation of our properties there are a number of factors that may adversely affect the income that our properties generate including the following 

risks related to our properties and operations 

adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating results 

our operating results are dependent upon our ability to maximize occupancy levels and rental rates in our selfstorage properties adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we operate may lower our occupancy levels and limit our ability to increase rents or require us to offer 

rental discounts if our properties fail to generate revenues sufficient to meet our cash requirements including operating and other expenses debt service and capital expenditures our net income funds from operations ffo cash flow financial condition ability to make cash distributions to stockholders and the trading price of our securities could be adversely affected the following factors among others may adversely affect the operating performance of our properties 

• the national economic climate and the local or regional economic climate in the markets in which we operate which may be adversely impacted by among other factors industry slowdowns relocation of businesses and changing demographics • periods of economic slowdown or recession rising interest rates or declining demand for selfstorage or the public perception that any of these events may occur could result in a general decline in rental rates or an increase in tenant defaults • a decline or worsening of the current economic environment • local or regional real estate market conditions such as competing properties the oversupply of selfstorage or a reduction in demand for selfstorage in a particular area • perceptions by prospective users of our selfstorage properties of the safety convenience and attractiveness of our properties and the neighborhoods in which they are located • increased operating costs including the need for capital improvements insurance premiums real estate taxes and utilities • the impact of environmental protection laws • earthquakes hurricanes and other natural disasters terrorist acts civil disturbances or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses and • changes in tax real estate and zoning laws recent us and international market and economic conditions have been challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower growth turbulence in us and international markets may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the financial condition of our customers if these market conditions continue they may result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to promptly relet our units or if the rates upon such reletting are significantly lower than expected our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

virtually all of our leases are on a monthtomonth basis any delay in reletting units as vacancies arise would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results in addition lower than expected rental rates upon reletting could adversely affect our revenues and impede our growth 

we depend upon our onsite personnel to maximize tenant satisfaction at each of our properties and any difficulties we encounter in hiring training and maintaining skilled field personnel may harm our operating performance 

we had 1884 field personnel as of february 15 2012 in the management and operation of our properties the general professionalism of our site managers and staff are contributing factors to a sites ability to successfully secure rentals and retain tenants we also rely upon our field personnel to maintain clean and secure selfstorage properties if we are unable to successfully recruit train and retain qualified field personnel the quality of service we strive to provide at our properties could be adversely affected which could lead to decreased occupancy levels and reduced operating performance 

uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flow 

we maintain comprehensive liability fire flood earthquake wind as deemed necessary or as required by our lenders extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our properties certain types of losses however may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable such as losses due to earthquakes hurricanes tornadoes riots acts of war or terrorism should an uninsured loss occur we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a property in addition if any such loss is insured we may be required to pay significant amounts on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to our insurer being obligated to reimburse us for the loss or the amount of the loss may exceed our coverage for the loss as a result our operating results may be adversely affected 

increases in taxes and regulatory compliance costs may reduce our income 

costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws generally are not passed through to tenants directly and will affect us increases in income property or other taxes generally are not passed through to tenants under leases and may reduce our net income ffo cash flow financial condition ability to pay or refinance our debt obligations ability to make cash distributions to stockholders and the trading price of our securities similarly changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which could similarly adversely affect our business and results of operations 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our properties may affect our results of operations 

under various us federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations owners and operators of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigating and remediating certain hazardous substances or other regulated materials on or in such property such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such substances or materials the presence of such substances or materials or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owners or operators ability to lease sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances or other regulated materials may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials into the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with asbestoscontaining materials 

certain environmental laws also impose liability without regard to knowledge or fault for removal or remediation of hazardous substances or other regulated materials upon owners and operators of contaminated property even after they no longer own or operate the property moreover the past or present owner or operator from which a release emanates could be liable for any personal injuries or property damages that may result from such releases as well as any damages to natural resources that may arise from such releases 

certain environmental laws impose compliance obligations on owners and operators of real property with respect to the management of hazardous materials and other regulated substances for example environmental laws govern the management of asbestoscontaining materials and leadbased paint failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties or other sanctions 

no assurances can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner or operator of our properties did 

not create any material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our properties there also exists the risk that material environmental conditions liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future finally future laws ordinances or regulations and future interpretations of existing laws ordinances or regulations may impose additional material environmental liability 

costs associated with complying with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 may result in unanticipated expenses 

under the ada places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these requirements became effective in 1992 a number of additional us federal state and local laws may also require modifications to our properties or restrict certain further renovations of the properties with respect to access thereto by disabled persons noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature which could result in substantial capital expenditures we have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine our compliance and we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with the ada or other legislation if one or more of our properties is not in compliance with the ada or other legislation then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the facility into compliance if we incur substantial costs to comply with the ada or other legislation our financial condition results of operations cash flow per share trading price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make cash distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected 

we face competition for the acquisition of selfstorage properties and other assets which may impede our ability to make future acquisitions or may increase the cost of these acquisitions 

we compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of selfstorage properties and other assets including national regional and local operators and developers of selfstorage properties these competitors may drive up the price we pay for selfstorage properties or other assets we seek to acquire or may succeed in acquiring those properties or assets themselves in addition our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive suitors because they may have greater resources may be willing to pay more or may have a more compatible operating philosophy in addition the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment properties may increase this competition would result in increased demand for these assets and therefore increased prices paid for them because of an increased interest in single property acquisitions among taxmotivated individual purchasers we may pay higher prices if we purchase single properties in comparison with portfolio acquisitions if we pay higher prices for selfstorage properties or other assets our profitability will be reduced 

we may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria which may impede our growth 

our ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy we may not be successful in identifying suitable properties or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms or at all failure to identify or consummate acquisitions will slow our growth which could in turn adversely affect our stock price 

our ability to acquire properties on favorable terms and successfully integrate and operate them may be constrained by the following significant risks 

• competition from local investors and other real estate investors with significant capital including other publiclytraded reits and institutional investment funds • competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price which could reduce our profitability • the inability to achieve satisfactory completion of due diligence investigations and other customary closing conditions • failure to finance an acquisition on favorable terms or at all • we may spend more than the time and amounts budgeted to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties and • we may acquire properties subject to liabilities without any recourse or with only limited recourse with respect to unknown liabilities such as liabilities for cleanup of undisclosed environmental contamination claims by persons dealing with the former owners of the properties and claims for indemnification by general partners directors officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties in addition strategic decisions by us such as acquisitions may adversely affect the price of our securities 

we may not be successful in integrating and operating acquired properties 

we expect to make future acquisitions of selfstorage properties if we acquire any selfstorage properties we will be required to integrate them into our existing portfolio the acquired properties may turn out to be less compatible with our growth strategy than originally anticipated may cause disruptions in our operations or may divert managements attention away from daytoday operations which could impair our operating results as a whole 

we do not always obtain independent appraisals of our properties and thus the consideration paid for these properties may exceed the value that may be indicated by thirdparty appraisals 

we do not always obtain thirdparty appraisals in connection with our acquisition of properties and the consideration being paid by us in exchange for those properties may exceed the value determined by thirdparty appraisals in such cases the value of the properties were determined by our senior management team 

our investments in development and redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns which would harm our operating results and reduce the amount of funds available for distributions 

in june 2009 we announced the winddown of our development activities to the extent that we engage in development and redevelopment activities we will be subject to the following risks normally associated with these projects 

• we may be unable to obtain financing for these projects on favorable terms or at all • we may not complete development projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts • we may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning land use building occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations and 11 

• occupancy rates and rents at newly developed or redeveloped properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors including market and economic conditions and may result in our investment not being profitable in deciding whether to develop or redevelop a particular property we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring the property up to the standards established for its intended market position or may be unable to increase occupancy at a newly developed property as quickly as expected or at all any substantial unanticipated delays or expenses could adversely affect the investment returns from these development or redevelopment projects and harm our operating results liquidity and financial condition which could result in a decline in the value of our securities 

we may rely on the investments of our joint venture partners for funding certain of our development and redevelopment projects if our reputation in the selfstorage industry changes or the number of investors considering us an attractive strategic partner is otherwise reduced our ability to develop or redevelop properties could be affected which would limit our growth 

risks related to our organization and structure 

our business could be harmed if key personnel with longstanding business relationships in the selfstorage industry terminate their employment with us 

our success depends on the continued services of members of our executive management team our executive management team has substantial experience in the selfstorage industry in addition our ability to acquire or develop properties in the future depends on the significant relationships our executive management team has developed with our institutional joint venture partners such as affiliates of prudential financial inc there is no guarantee that any of them will remain employed by us we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers the loss of services of one or more members of our executive management team could harm our business and our prospects 

we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business without stockholder consent which may subject us to different risks 

we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business at any time without the consent of our stockholders which could result in our making investments and engaging in business activities that are different from and possibly riskier than the investments and businesses described in this document a change in our investment strategy or our entry into new lines of business may increase our exposure to other risks or real estate market fluctuations 

if other selfstorage companies convert to an upreit structure or if tax laws change we may no longer have an advantage in competing for potential acquisitions 

because we are structured as an upreit we are a more attractive acquirer of properties to taxmotivated sellers than our competitors that are not structured as upreits however if other selfstorage companies restructure their holdings to become upreits this competitive advantage will disappear in addition new legislation may be enacted or new interpretations of existing legislation may be issued by the internal revenue service irs or the us treasury department that could affect the attractiveness of our upreit structure so that it may no longer assist us in competing for acquisitions 

tax indemnification obligations may require the operating partnership to maintain certain debt levels 

we have provided certain tax protections to various third parties in connection with their property contributions to the operating partnership upon acquisition by the company including making 

available the opportunity to 1 guarantee debt or 2 enter into a special loss allocation and deficit restoration obligation we have agreed to these provisions in order to assist these contributors in preserving their tax position after their contributions these obligations may require us to maintain certain indebtedness levels that we would not otherwise require for our business 

our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority 

as of december 31 2011 we held interests in 341 operating properties through joint ventures some of these arrangements could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority our reliance on coventurers financial conditions and disputes between us and our coventurers we expect to continue our joint venture strategy by entering into more joint ventures for the purpose of developing new selfstorage properties and acquiring existing properties in such event we would not be in a position to exercise sole decisionmaking authority regarding the property partnership joint venture or other entity the decisionmaking authority regarding the properties we currently hold through joint ventures is either vested exclusively with our joint venture partners is subject to a majority vote of the joint venture partners or equally shared by us and the joint venture partners in addition investments in partnerships joint ventures or other entities may under certain circumstances involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or coventurers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions partners or coventurers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions such as a sale because neither we nor the partner or coventurer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or coventurers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers andor directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or coventurers might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our thirdparty partners or coventurers which could harm our financial condition 

spencer f kirk chairman and chief executive officer charles l allen executive vice president and chief legal officer and other members of our senior management team have outside business interests which could divert their time and attention away from us which could harm our business 

spencer f kirk our chairman and chief executive officer as well as certain other members of our senior management team have outside business interests these business interests include the ownership of a selfstorage property located in pico rivera california other than this property the members of our senior management are not currently engaged in any other selfstorage activities outside the company these outside business interests could interfere with their ability to devote time to our business and affairs and as a result our business could be harmed 

conflicts of interest could arise as a result of our relationship with our operating partnership 

conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates and our operating partnership or any partner thereof our directors and officers have duties to our company under applicable maryland law in connection with their management of our company at the same time we through our whollyowned subsidiary have fiduciary duties as a general partner to our operating partnership and to the limited partners under delaware law in connection with the management of our operating partnership our duties through our whollyowned subsidiary as a general partner to our operating partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our company the partnership agreement of our operating partnership does not require us to resolve such conflicts in favor of either our company or the limited partners in 

our operating partnership unless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement delaware law generally requires a general partner of a delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith fairness and loyalty and which generally prohibit such general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest 

additionally the partnership agreement expressly limits our liability by providing that neither we our direct whollyowned massachusetts business trust subsidiary as the general partner of the operating partnership nor any of our or their trustees directors or officers will be liable or accountable in damages to our operating partnership the limited partners or assignees for errors in judgment mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if we or such trustee director or officer acted in good faith in addition our operating partnership is required to indemnify us our affiliates and each of our respective trustees officers directors employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against any and all losses claims damages liabilities whether joint or several expenses including without limitation attorneys fees and other legal fees and expenses judgments fines settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims demands actions suits or proceedings civil criminal administrative or investigative that relate to the operations of the operating partnership provided that our operating partnership will not indemnify for 1 willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law 2 any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement or 3 in the case of a criminal proceeding the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful 

the provisions of delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement 

we may pursue less vigorous enforcement of terms of contribution and other agreements because of conflicts of interest with certain of our officers 

spencer f kirk chairman and chief executive officer charles l allen executive vice president and chief legal officer other members of our senior management team and kenneth m woolley director had direct or indirect ownership interests in certain properties that were contributed to our operating partnership in the formation transactions following the completion of the formation transactions we under the agreements relating to the contribution of such interests became entitled to indemnification and damages in the event of breaches of representations or warranties made by the contributors none of these contribution and noncompetition agreements was negotiated at an armslength basis we may choose not to enforce or to enforce less vigorously our rights under these contribution and noncompetition agreements because of our desire to maintain our ongoing relationships with the individuals party to these agreements 

certain provisions of maryland law and our organizational documents including the stock ownership limit imposed by our charter may inhibit market activity in our stock and could prevent or delay a change in control transaction 

our charter subject to certain exceptions authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a reit and to limit any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding common stock or 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limit however our board of directors may not grant 

an exemption from the ownership limit to any proposed transferee whose ownership could jeopardize our qualification as a reit these restrictions on ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the ownership limit may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders different ownership limits apply to the family of kenneth m woolley certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and spencer f kirk certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and certain designated investment entities as defined in our charter 

our board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder approval in addition our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares our board of directors could issue additional shares of our common stock or establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise not be in the best interests of our stockholders 

our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited 

maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances in addition our charter eliminates our directors and officers liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law as a result we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law in addition we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers 

to the extent our distributions represent a return of capital for us federal income tax purposes our stockholders could recognize an increased capital gain upon a subsequent sale of common stock 

distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and not treated by us as a dividend will not be taxable to a us stockholder under current us federal income tax law to the extent those distributions do not exceed the stockholders adjusted tax basis in his her or its common stock but instead will constitute a return of capital and will reduce such adjusted basis if distributions result in a reduction of a stockholders adjusted basis in such holders common stock subsequent sales of such holders common stock will result in recognition of an increased capital gain or decreased capital loss due to the reduction in such adjusted basis 

risks related to the real estate industry 

our primary business involves the ownership and operation of selfstorage properties 

our current strategy is to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop only selfstorage properties consequently we are subject to risks inherent in investments in a single industry because investments in real estate are inherently illiquid this strategy makes it difficult for us to diversify our investment portfolio and to limit our risk when economic conditions change decreases in market rents negative tax real estate and zoning law changes and changes in environmental protection laws may also increase our costs lower the value of our investments and decrease our income which would adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties 

because real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in our portfolio in response to changing economic financial and investment conditions is limited the real estate market is affected by many factors such as general economic conditions availability of financing interest rates and other factors including supply and demand that are beyond our control we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property 

we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold we cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements in acquiring a property we may agree to transfer restrictions that materially restrict us from selling that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property these transfer restrictions would impede our ability to sell a property even if we deem it necessary or appropriate 

any investments in unimproved real property may take significantly longer to yield incomeproducing returns if at all and may result in additional costs to us to comply with rezoning restrictions or environmental regulations 

we have invested in the past and may invest in the future in unimproved real property unimproved properties generally take longer to yield incomeproducing returns based on the typical time required for development any development of unimproved property may also expose us to the risks and uncertainties associated with rezoning the land for a higher use or development and environmental concerns of governmental entities andor community groups any unsuccessful investments or delays in realizing an incomeproducing return or increased costs to develop unimproved real estate could restrict our ability to earn our targeted rate of return on an investment or adversely affect our ability to pay operating expenses which would harm our financial condition and operating results 

any negative perceptions of the selfstorage industry generally may result in a decline in our stock price 

to the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the selfstorage industry the value of our securities may be negatively impacted which could result in our securities trading below the inherent value of our assets 

risks related to our debt financings 

disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us 

in recent years the us and international credit markets have experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to refinance existing debt maturities on favorable terms or at all which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions and fund development projects a prolonged downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing 

required payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our properties or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations 

as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 14 billion of outstanding indebtedness we may incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions and development we may borrow under our credit lines or borrow new funds to finance these future properties additionally we do not anticipate that our internally generated cash flow will be adequate to repay our existing indebtedness upon maturity and therefore we expect to repay our indebtedness through refinancings and equity andor debt offerings further we may need to borrow funds in order to make cash distributions to maintain our qualification as a reit or to make our expected distributions 

if we are required to utilize our credit lines for purposes other than acquisition activity this will reduce the amount available for acquisitions and could slow our growth therefore our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences including the following 

• our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments • we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms including to make acquisitions or to continue to make distributions required to maintain our qualification as a reit • we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness • because a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates an increase in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense • we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties possibly on disadvantageous terms • after debt service the amount available for cash distributions to our stockholders is reduced • our debt level could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt • we may experience increased vulnerability to economic and industry downturns reducing our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions • we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases 17 

• we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgages may enforce our guarantees • we may violate restrictive covenants in our loan documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations and • our default under any one of our mortgage loans with crossdefault or crosscollateralization provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness or result in the foreclosures of other properties we could become highly leveraged in the future because our organizational documents contain no limitation on the amount of debt we may incur 

our organizational documents contain no limitations on the amount of indebtedness that we or our operating partnership may incur we could alter the balance between our total outstanding indebtedness and the value of our portfolio at any time if we become more highly leveraged then the resulting increase in debt service could adversely affect our ability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness and to pay our anticipated cash distributions andor to continue to make cash distributions to maintain our reit qualification and could harm our financial condition 

increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and make cash distributions to our stockholders 

as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 14 billion of debt outstanding of which approximately 3329 million or 245 was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps this variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 27 per annum increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase our interest expense which could harm our cash flow and our ability to pay cash distributions for example if market rates of interest on this variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points excluding variable rate debt with interest rate floors the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 26 million annually 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations 

in certain cases we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements hedging involves risks such as the risk that the counterparty may fail to honor its obligations under an arrangement failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders 

risks related to qualification and operation as a reit 

to maintain our qualification as a reit we may be forced to borrow funds on a shortterm basis during unfavorable market conditions 

to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our net taxable income each year excluding net capital gains and we are subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income each year in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions made by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years while historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances its own stock for distributions with respect to taxable years ending on or before december 31 2011 recent internal revenue service guidance allows us to satisfy up to 90 of the 

distribution requirements discussed above through the distribution of shares of our stock if certain conditions are met assuming we continue to satisfy these distributions requirements with cash we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis or possibly longterm to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these borrowing needs could result from a difference in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for us federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt amortization payments 

dividends payable by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates 

the maximum us federal income tax rate for dividends paid by domestic corporations to individual us stockholders is 15 through 2012 dividends paid by reits however are generally not eligible for the reduced rates the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause stockholders who are individuals to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits including our securities 

in addition the relative attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends which could negatively affect the value of our properties 

possible legislative or other actions affecting reits could adversely affect our stockholders 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us treasury department changes to tax laws which changes may have retroactive application could adversely affect our stockholders it cannot be predicted whether when in what forms or with what effective dates the tax laws applicable to us or our stockholders will be changed 

the power of our board of directors to revoke our reit election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders 

our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election without the approval of our stockholders if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a reit if we cease to qualify as a reit we would become subject to us federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our net taxable income to our stockholders which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholders 

our failure to qualify as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock 

we believe we operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit or lose our qualification as a reit at any time we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution for each of the years involved because 

• we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates • we also could be subject to the us federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes and • unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following a year during which we were disqualified 19 

in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits this means that our us individual stockholders would be taxed on our dividends at capital gains rates and our us corporate stockholders would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends subject in each case to applicable limitations under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and are able to avail ourselves of one or more of the relief provisions under the internal revenue code in order to maintain our reit status we may nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of 50000 or more for each such failure as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our securities 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the internal revenue code is greater in the case of a reit that like us holds its assets through a partnership the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the composition of our assets the sources of our gross income and the owners of our stock our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market value of our assets some of which are not susceptible to precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our net taxable income excluding capital gains and we will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income including capital gains in addition legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors our ability to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that is intended to allow us to qualify for taxation as a reit we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the internal revenue service regarding our qualification as a reit 

we will pay some taxes 

even though we qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we will be required to pay some us federal state and local taxes on our income and property extra space management inc manages selfstorage properties for our joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties we jointly with extra space management inc elected to treat extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary trs of our company for us federal income tax purposes a taxable reit subsidiary is a fully taxable corporation and may be limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to us esm reinsurance limited a whollyowned subsidiary of extra space management inc generates income from insurance premiums that are subject to federal income tax and state insurance premiums tax in addition we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements among our tenants our taxable reit subsidiary and us are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties or if we receive payments for inventory or property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business also if we sell property as a dealer ie to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on any gain arising from such sales while we dont intend to sell properties as a dealer the irs could take a contrary position to the extent that we are or our taxable reit subsidiary is required to pay us federal state or local taxes we will have less cash available for distribution to stockholders 

complying with reit requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 

to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the nature and diversification of our assets the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock in order to meet these tests we may be required to forego attractive business or investment opportunities thus compliance with the reit requirements may adversely affect our ability to operate solely to maximize profits

 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2011 we owned or had ownership interests in 697 operating selfstorage properties of these properties 356 are whollyowned and 341 are held in joint ventures in addition we managed an additional 185 properties for franchisees or third parties bringing the total number of properties which we own andor manage to 882 these properties are located in 34 states and washington dc we receive a management fee generally equal to approximately 6 of cash collected from total revenues to manage the joint venture third party and franchise sites as of december 31 2011 we owned andor managed approximately 64 million square feet of rentable space configured in approximately 585000 separate storage units approximately 77 of our properties are clustered around large population centers such as atlanta baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas houston las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san franciscooakland these markets contain aboveaverage population and income demographics for new selfstorage properties the clustering of assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale our acquisitions have given us an increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in many markets where we had no previous presence 

we consider a property to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization we consider a property to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 or has been open for three years 

as of december 31 2011 over 448000 tenants were leasing storage units at the 882 operating properties that we own andor manage primarily on a monthtomonth basis providing the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit although leases are shortterm in duration the typical tenant tends to remain at our properties for an extended period of time for properties that were stabilized as of december 31 2011 the average length of stay was approximately 13 months the average annual rent per square foot at these stabilized properties was approximately 1367 at december 31 2011 compared to 1349 at december 31 2010 

our property portfolio is made up of different types of construction and building configurations depending on the site and the municipality where it is located most often sites are what we consider hybrid facilities a mix of both driveup buildings and multifloor buildings we have a number of multifloor buildings with elevator access only and a number of facilities featuring groundfloor access only 

the following table sets forth additional information regarding the occupancy of our stabilized properties on a statebystate basis as of december 31 2011 and 2010 the information as of december 31 2010 is on a pro forma basis as though all the properties owned at december 31 2011 were under our control as of december 31 2010

overview 

we are a fully integrated selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust or reit formed to continue the business commenced in 1977 by our predecessor companies to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop professionally managed selfstorage properties since our ipo our fully integrated development and acquisition teams have completed the development or acquisition of 595 selfstorage properties 

at december 31 2011 we owned had ownership interests in or managed 882 operating properties in 34 states and washington dc of these 882 operating properties 356 were whollyowned we held joint venture interests in 341 properties and our taxable reit subsidiary extra space management inc operated an additional 185 properties that are owned by franchisees or third parties in exchange for a management fee these operating properties contain approximately 64 million square feet of rentable space in approximately 585000 units and currently serve a customer base of over 448000 tenants 

our properties are generally situated in convenient highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as atlanta baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas houston las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san franciscooakland these areas all enjoy above average population growth and income levels the clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale we consider a property to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization a property is considered to be stabilized once it has achieved an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 or has been open for three years 

to maximize the performance of our properties we employ a stateoftheart webbased tracking and yield management technology called store developed by our management team store enables us to analyze set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions in addition we also have an industryleading revenue management system we believe that the combination of stores yield management capabilities and the systematic processes developed by our team using our revenue management system allows us to more proactively manage revenues 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under existing leases at each of our selfstorage properties from management fees on the properties we manage for jointventure partners franchisees and unaffiliated third parties and from our tenant reinsurance program our management fee is generally equal to approximately 6 of cash collected from total revenues generated by the managed properties we also receive an asset management fee of 05 of the total asset value from one of our joint ventures 

we operate in competitive markets often where consumers have multiple selfstorage properties from which to choose competition has impacted and will continue to impact our property results we experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels with occupancy levels generally higher in the 

summer months due to increased moving activity our operating results depend materially on our ability to lease available selfstorage units to actively manage unit rental rates and on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments we believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the use of store and through the use of our revenue management system 

we continue to evaluate and implement a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to enable us to maximize stockholder value our strategies to maximize stockholder value include the following 

• maximize the performance of properties through strategic efficient and proactive management we pursue revenuegenerating and expense minimizing opportunities in our operations our revenue management team seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our technology systems ability to provide realtime interactive rental rate and discount management our size allows us greater ability than most of our competitors to implement national regional and local marketing programs which we believe attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost • acquire selfstorage properties from strategic partners and third parties our acquisitions team continues to pursue the acquisition of single properties and multiproperty portfolios that we believe can provide stockholder value we have established a reputation as a reliable ethical buyer which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions in addition we believe our status as an upreit enables flexibility when structuring deals • expand our management business our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and expand our geographic footprint this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale in addition we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline we pursue strategic relationships with owners that strengthen our acquisition pipeline through agreements which typically give us first right of refusal to purchase the managed property in the event of a potential sale during 2011 we acquired 55 whollyowned properties and completed the development of five whollyowned properties all in our core markets we have one whollyowned development property which is scheduled for completion by the end of the first quarter of 2012 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those that impact our most critical accounting policies we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies 

consolidation arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as variable interest entities vies an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it is the primary beneficiary of the vie 

a vie is created when i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii the entitys equity holders as a group either a lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance b are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur or c do not have the right to receive 

expected residual returns of the entity if they occur if an entity is deemed to be a vie the enterprise that is deemed to have a variable interest or combination of variable interests that provides the enterprise with a controlling financial interest in the vie is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 

we have concluded that under certain circumstances when we 1 enter into option agreements for the purchase of land or facilities from an entity and pay a nonrefundable deposit or 2 enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures a vie may be created under condition i ii b or c of the previous paragraph for each vie created we have performed a qualitative analysis including considering which party if any has the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of each vie and whether that party has the obligation to absorb losses of the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could be significant to the vie if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie the assets liabilities and operations of the vie are consolidated with our financial statements as of december 31 2011 the company had no consolidated vies additionally our operating partnership has notes payable to three trusts that are vies under condition iia above since the operating partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts these vies are not consolidated 

real estate assets real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation direct and allowable internal costs associated with the development construction renovation and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized interest property taxes and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized 

expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives depreciation is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements which are generally between five and 39 years 

in connection with our acquisition of properties the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values which are estimated using significant unobservable inputs the value of the tangible assets consisting of land and buildings are determined as if vacant intangible assets which represent the value of existing tenant relationships are recorded at their fair values based on the avoided cost to replace the current leases we measure the value of tenant relationships based on the rent lost due to the amount of time required to replace existing customers which is based on our historical experience with turnover in our facilities debt assumed as part of an acquisition is recorded at fair value based on current interest rates compared to contractual rates acquisitionrelated transaction costs are expensed as incurred 

intangible lease rights include 1 purchase price amounts allocated to leases on two properties that cannot be classified as ground or building leases these rights are amortized to expense over the term of the leases and 2 intangibles related to ground leases on four properties where the ground leases were assumed by the company at rates that were different than the current market rates for similar leases the value associated with these assumed leases were recorded as intangibles which will be amortized over the lease terms 

evaluation of asset impairment we evaluate long lived assets held for use when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment we review each property at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist we focus on properties where occupancy andor rental income have decreased by a significant amount for these properties we determine whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the property will likely recover the lost occupancy andor revenue in the short term in addition we carefully review properties in the leaseup stage and compare actual operating results to original projections 

when we determine that an event that may indicate impairment has occurred we compare the carrying value of the related longlived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets an impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the assets 

when real estate assets are identified as held for sale we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the fair value of the assets net of selling costs if the estimated fair values net of selling costs of the assets that have been identified for sale are less than the net carrying value of the assets a valuation allowance is established the operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are generally presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

fair value of financial instruments the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents restricted cash receivables other financial instruments included in other assets accounts payable and accrued expenses variable rate notes payable lines of credit and other liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2011 and 2010 approximate fair value the fair values of our notes receivable our fixed rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts and exchangeable senior notes are as follows 



investments in real estate ventures our investments in real estate joint ventures where we have significant influence but not control and joint ventures which are vies in which we are not the primary beneficiary are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

under the equity method our investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures for the purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows we follow the look through approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures under this approach distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital eg a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint ventures sale of assets in which case it is reported as an investing activity 

our management assesses annually whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired and when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment an investment is impaired if managements estimate of the fair value of the investment using significant unobservable inputs is less than its carrying value to the extent impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment 

derivative instruments and hedging activities the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk are considered fair value hedges derivatives used to 

hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges 

for derivatives designated as fair value hedges changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings 

conversion of operating partnership units conversions of operating partnership units to common stock when converted under the original provisions of the operating partnership agreement are accounted for by reclassifying the underlying net book value of the units from noncontrolling interest to our equity the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the adjustment to the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest is recognized as additional paid in capital of the company 

revenue and expense recognition rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants leases are generally on monthtomonth terms prepaid rents are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the leases promotional discounts are recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period late charges administrative fees merchandise sales and truck rentals are recognized in income when earned management and franchise fee revenues are recognized monthly as services are performed and in accordance with the terms of the related management agreements tenant reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenues over the period of insurance coverage equity in earnings of real estate entities is recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate entities interest income is recognized as earned 

property expenses including utilities property taxes repairs and maintenance and other costs to manage the facilities are recognized as incurred we accrue for property tax expense based upon invoice amounts estimates and historical trends if these estimates are incorrect the timing of expense recognition could be affected 

real estate sales in general sales of real estate and related profitslosses are recognized when all consideration has changed hands and risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred certain types of continuing involvement preclude sale treatment and related profit recognition other forms of continuing involvement allow for sale recognition but require deferral of profit recognition 

income taxes we have elected to be treated as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code in order to maintain our qualification as a reit among other things we are required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets as a reit we are not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to our stockholders we plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex if we were to fail to meet these requirements we would be subject to federal income tax we are subject to certain state and local taxes provision for such taxes has been included in income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

we have elected to treat one of our corporate subsidiaries extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary trs in general our trs may perform additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or nonreal estate related business except for the operation or management of health care facilities or lodging facilities or the provision to any person under a franchise license or otherwise of rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated a trs is subject to corporate federal income tax deferred tax assets and 

liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense when incurred 

stockbased compensation the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards to employees and directors are based on estimated fair values awards are valued at fair value and recognized on a straight line basis over the service periods of each award

funds from operations 

ffo provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary along with net income and cash flows for an understanding of our operating results we believe ffo is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings net earnings assume that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses the values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and we believe ffo more accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts inc nareit as net income computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap excluding gains or losses on sales of operating properties and impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate assets plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis we believe that to further understand our performance ffo should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with gaap as presented in the consolidated financial statements 

the computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions the following table sets forth the calculation of ffo for the periods indicated

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2011 we had 26484 available in cash and cash equivalents we intend to use this cash to repay debt scheduled to mature in 2012 and for general corporate purposes we are required to distribute at least 90 of our net taxable income excluding net capital gains to our stockholders on an annual basis to maintain our qualification as a reit 

our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts during 2011 we experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash or cash equivalents however there can be no assurance that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets

we expect to fund our shortterm liquidity requirements including operating expenses recurring capital expenditures dividends to stockholders distributions to holders of op units and interest on our outstanding indebtedness out of our operating cash flow cash on hand and borrowings under our credit lines in addition we are pursuing additional term loans secured by unencumbered properties 

our liquidity needs consist primarily of cash distributions to stockholders property acquisitions principal payments under our borrowings and nonrecurring capital expenditures we may from time to time seek to repurchase or redeem our outstanding debt shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases or redemptions if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual 

restrictions and other factors in addition we evaluate on an ongoing basis the merits of strategic acquisitions and other relationships which may require us to raise additional funds we do not expect that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs and instead expect to fund such needs out of additional borrowings of secured or unsecured indebtedness joint ventures with third parties and from the proceeds of public and private offerings of equity and debt additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all any additional issuance of equity or equitylinked securities may result in dilution to our stockholders in addition any new securities we issue could have rights preferences and privileges senior to holders of our common stock we may also use op units as currency to fund acquisitions from selfstorage owners who desire taxdeferral in their exiting transactions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes further except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitments or intent to provide funding to any such entities accordingly we are not materially exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships

as of december 31 2011 the weighted average interest rate for all fixed rate loans was 53 and the weighted average interest rate on all variable rate loans was 27 

financing strategy 

we will continue to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts reviewed from time to time by our board of directors although our board of directors has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur we will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be 

either fixed or variable rate in making financing decisions we will consider factors including but not limited to 

• the interest rate of the proposed financing • the extent to which the financing impacts flexibility in managing our properties • prepayment penalties and restrictions on refinancing • the purchase price of properties acquired with debt financing • longterm objectives with respect to the financing • target investment returns • the ability of particular properties and our company as a whole to generate cash flow sufficient to cover expected debt service payments • overall level of consolidated indebtedness • timing of debt and lease maturities • provisions that require recourse and crosscollateralization • corporate credit ratios including debt service coverage debt to total capitalization and debt to undepreciated assets and • the overall ratio of fixed and variable rate debt our indebtedness may be recourse nonrecourse or crosscollateralized if the indebtedness is nonrecourse the collateral will be limited to the particular properties to which the indebtedness relates in addition we may invest in properties subject to existing loans collateralized by mortgages or similar liens on our properties or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis we may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness to refinance investments including the redevelopment of existing properties for general working capital or to purchase additional interests in partnerships or joint ventures or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable 

we may from time to time seek to retire repurchase or redeem our additional outstanding debt including our exchangeable senior notes as well as shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases or redemptions if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

seasonality 

the selfstorage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations a greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from may through september historically our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of july while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early march results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our future income cash flows and fair values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary and tax policies domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 1400000 in total debt of which approximately 332900 was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt excluding variable rate debt with interest rate floors would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 2600 annually 

interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur further in the event of a change of that magnitude we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure

management 

members of our executive management team have significant experience in all aspects of the selfstorage industry the senior management team has collectively acquired andor developed 536 properties since our ipo our executive management team and their years of industry experience are as follows spencer f kirk chairman and chief executive officer 10 years kent w christensen 

executive vice president and chief financial officer 13 years charles l allen executive vice president and chief legal officer 13 years and karl haas executive vice president and chief operating officer 23 years 

members of the executive management team have guided the company through substantial growth developing and acquiring over 41 billion in assets since 1996 this growth has been funded through public equity offerings and more than 20 billion in private equity capital since 1998 this private equity capital has come primarily from sophisticated high networth individuals and institutional investors such as affiliates of prudential financial inc and fidelity investments 

our executive management and board of directors have a significant ownership position in the company with executive officers and directors owning approximately 6870214 shares or 78 of our outstanding common stock as of february 14 2011 

industry  competition 

selfstorage facilities refers to properties that offer monthtomonth storage space rental for personal or business use selfstorage offers a costeffective and flexible storage alternative tenants rent fully enclosed spaces that can vary in size according to their specific needs and to which they have unlimited exclusive access tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units selfstorage unit sizes typically range from five feet by five feet to 20 feet by 20 feet with an interior height of eight to 12 feet properties generally have onsite managers who supervise and run the daytoday operations providing tenants with assistance as needed 

selfstorage provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions due to life changes or simply because of a need for storage space the mix of residential tenants using a selfstorage property is determined by a propertys local demographics and often includes people who are looking to downsize their living space or others who are not yet settled into a permanent residence items that residential tenants place in selfstorage properties range from cars boats and recreational vehicles to furniture household items and appliances commercial tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods records inventory or storage for seasonal goods 

our research has shown that tenants choose a selfstorage property based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or business making highdensity hightraffic population centers ideal locations for selfstorage properties a propertys perceived security and the general professionalism of the site managers and staff are also contributing factors to a sites ability to successfully secure rentals although most selfstorage properties are leased to tenants on a monthtomonth basis tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time 

there are seasonal fluctuations in occupancy rates for selfstorage properties based on our experience generally there is increased leasing activity at selfstorage properties during the summer months due to the higher number of people who relocate during this period the highest level of occupancy is typically at the end of july while the lowest level of occupancy is seen in late february and early march 

since inception in the early 1970s the selfstorage industry has experienced significant growth in the past ten years there has been even greater growth according to the selfstorage almanac the almanac in 2000 there were only 31947 selfstorage properties in the united states with an average occupancy rate of 837 of net rentable square feet compared to 49356 selfstorage properties in 2010 with an average occupancy rate of 755 of net rentable square feet 

increased supply has affected our business and has led to both pricing and discount pressure the increased supply has limited our ability to increase revenues in many markets in which we operate many markets have been able to absorb the increase in selfstorage development due to superior 

demographics and density however select markets have not been able to absorb the new facilities and have not performed as well 

we have encountered competition when we have sought to acquire properties especially for brokered portfolios aggressive bidding practices have been commonplace between both public and private entities and this competition will likely continue 

the industry is also characterized by fragmented ownership according to the almanac the top ten selfstorage companies in the united states owned approximately 109 of total us selfstorage properties and the top 50 selfstorage companies owned approximately 145 of the total us properties as of december 31 2010 we believe this fragmentation will contribute to continued consolidation at some level in the future we also believe that we are well positioned to compete for acquisitions given our historical reputation for closing deals 

we are the second largest selfstorage operator in the united states we are one of four public selfstorage reits along with public storage inc sovran selfstorage inc and ustoreit inc 

longterm growth and investment strategies 

our primary business objectives are to maximize cash flow available for distribution to our stockholders and to achieve sustainable longterm growth in cash flow per share in order to maximize longterm stockholder value we continue to evaluate a range of growth initiatives and opportunities including the following

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our securities involves various risks all investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information contained in this annual report before trading in our securities if any of the events set forth in the following risks actually occur our business operating results prospects and financial condition could be harmed 

our performance is subject to risks associated with real estate investments we are a real estate company that derives our income from operation of our properties there are a number of factors that may adversely affect the income that our properties generate including the following 

risks related to our properties and operations 

adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating results 

our operating results are dependent upon our ability to maximize occupancy levels and rental rates in our selfstorage properties adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we operate may lower our occupancy levels and limit our ability to increase rents or require us to offer rental discounts if our properties fail to generate revenues sufficient to meet our cash requirements including operating and other expenses debt service and capital expenditures our net income funds from operations ffo cash flow financial condition ability to make cash distributions to stockholders and the trading price of our securities could be adversely affected the following factors among others may adversely affect the operating performance of our properties 

• the national economic climate and the local or regional economic climate in the markets in which we operate which may be adversely impacted by among other factors industry slowdowns relocation of businesses and changing demographics • periods of economic slowdown or recession rising interest rates or declining demand for selfstorage or the public perception that any of these events may occur could result in a general decline in rental rates or an increase in tenant defaults • a decline or worsening of the current economic environment • local or regional real estate market conditions such as competing properties the oversupply of selfstorage or a reduction in demand for selfstorage in a particular area • perceptions by prospective users of our selfstorage properties of the safety convenience and attractiveness of our properties and the neighborhoods in which they are located 9 

• increased operating costs including the need for capital improvements insurance premiums real estate taxes and utilities • the impact of environmental protection laws • earthquakes hurricanes and other natural disasters terrorist acts civil disturbances or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses and • changes in tax real estate and zoning laws recent us and international market and economic conditions have been challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower growth through 2008 2009 and 2010 for the year ended december 31 2010 concerns about the systemic impact of inflation energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit and other macroeconomic factors have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the global economy and increased market uncertainty and instability turbulence in us and international markets may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the financial condition of our customers if these market conditions continue they may result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to promptly relet our units or if the rates upon such reletting are significantly lower than expected then our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

virtually all of our leases are on a monthtomonth basis any delay in reletting units as vacancies arise would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results in addition lower than expected rental rates upon reletting could adversely affect our revenues and impede our growth 

we depend upon our onsite personnel to maximize tenant satisfaction at each of our properties and any difficulties we encounter in hiring training and maintaining skilled field personnel may harm our operating performance 

we had 1793 field personnel as of february 14 2011 in the management and operation of our properties the general professionalism of our site managers and staff are contributing factors to a sites ability to successfully secure rentals and retain tenants we also rely upon our field personnel to maintain clean and secure selfstorage properties if we are unable to successfully recruit train and retain qualified field personnel the quality of service we strive to provide at our properties could be adversely affected which could lead to decreased occupancy levels and reduced operating performance 

uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flow 

we maintain comprehensive liability fire flood earthquake wind as deemed necessary or as required by our lenders extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our properties certain types of losses however may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable such as losses due to earthquakes hurricanes tornadoes riots acts of war or terrorism should an uninsured loss occur we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a property in addition if any such loss is insured we may be required to pay significant amounts on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to our insurer being obligated to reimburse us for the loss or the amount of the loss may exceed our coverage for the loss as a result our operating results may be adversely affected 

increases in taxes and regulatory compliance costs may reduce our income 

costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws generally are not passed through to tenants directly and will affect us increases in income property or other taxes generally are not passed through to tenants under leases and may reduce our net income ffo cash flow financial condition ability to 

pay or refinance our debt obligations ability to make cash distributions to stockholders and the trading price of our securities similarly changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which could similarly adversely affect our business and results of operations 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our properties may affect our results of operations 

under various us federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations owners and operators of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigating and remediating certain hazardous substances or other regulated materials on or in such property such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such substances or materials the presence of such substances or materials or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owners or operators ability to lease sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances or other regulated materials may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials into the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with asbestoscontaining materials 

certain environmental laws also impose liability without regard to knowledge or fault for removal or remediation of hazardous substances or other regulated materials upon owners and operators of contaminated property even after they no longer own or operate the property moreover the past or present owner or operator from which a release emanates could be liable for any personal injuries or property damages that may result from such releases as well as any damages to natural resources that may arise from such releases 

certain environmental laws impose compliance obligations on owners and operators of real property with respect to the management of hazardous materials and other regulated substances for example environmental laws govern the management of asbestoscontaining materials and leadbased paint failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties or other sanctions 

no assurances can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner or operator of our properties did not create any material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our properties there also exists the risk that material environmental conditions liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future finally future laws ordinances or regulations and future interpretations of existing laws ordinances or regulations may impose additional material environmental liability 

costs associated with complying with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 may result in unanticipated expenses 

under the ada places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these requirements became effective in 1992 a number of additional us federal state and local laws may also require modifications to our properties or restrict certain further renovations of the properties with respect to access thereto by disabled persons noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature which could result in substantial capital expenditures we have not conducted an audit or investigation 

of all of our properties to determine our compliance and we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with the ada or other legislation if one or more of our properties is not in compliance with the ada or other legislation then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the facility into compliance if we incur substantial costs to comply with the ada or other legislation our financial condition results of operations cash flow per share trading price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make cash distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected 

we face competition for the acquisition of selfstorage properties and other assets which may impede our ability to make future acquisitions or may increase the cost of these acquisitions 

we compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of selfstorage properties and other assets including national regional and local operators and developers of selfstorage properties these competitors may drive up the price we pay for selfstorage properties or other assets we seek to acquire or may succeed in acquiring those properties or assets themselves in addition our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive suitors because they may have greater resources may be willing to pay more or may have a more compatible operating philosophy in addition the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment properties may increase this competition would result in increased demand for these assets and therefore increased prices paid for them because of an increased interest in single property acquisitions among taxmotivated individual purchasers we may pay higher prices if we purchase single properties in comparison with portfolio acquisitions if we pay higher prices for selfstorage properties or other assets our profitability will be reduced 

we may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria which may impede our growth 

our ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy we may not be successful in identifying suitable properties or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms or at all failure to identify or consummate acquisitions will slow our growth which could in turn adversely affect our stock price 

our ability to acquire properties on favorable terms and successfully integrate and operate them may be constrained by the following significant risks 

• competition from local investors and other real estate investors with significant capital including other publiclytraded reits and institutional investment funds • competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price which could reduce our profitability • the inability to achieve satisfactory completion of due diligence investigations and other customary closing conditions • failure to finance an acquisition on favorable terms or at all • we may spend more than the time and amounts budgeted to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties and • we may acquire properties subject to liabilities without any recourse or with only limited recourse with respect to unknown liabilities such as liabilities for cleanup of undisclosed environmental contamination claims by persons dealing with the former owners of the 12 

properties and claims for indemnification by general partners directors officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties 

in addition strategic decisions by us such as acquisitions may adversely affect the price of our securities 

we may not be successful in integrating and operating acquired properties 

we expect to make future acquisitions of selfstorage properties if we acquire any selfstorage properties we will be required to integrate them into our existing portfolio the acquired properties may turn out to be less compatible with our growth strategy than originally anticipated may cause disruptions in our operations or may divert managements attention away from daytoday operations which could impair our operating results as a whole 

we do not always obtain independent appraisals of our properties and thus the consideration paid for these properties may exceed the value that may be indicated by thirdparty appraisals 

we do not always obtain thirdparty appraisals in connection with our acquisition of properties and the consideration being paid by us in exchange for those properties may exceed the value determined by thirdparty appraisals in such cases the value of the properties were determined by our senior management team 

our investments in development and redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns which would harm our operating results and reduce the amount of funds available for distributions 

on june 2 2009 we announced the winddown of our development activities to the extent that we engage in development and redevelopment activities we will be subject to the following risks normally associated with these projects 

• we may be unable to obtain financing for these projects on favorable terms or at all • we may not complete development projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts • we may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning land use building occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations and • occupancy rates and rents at newly developed or redeveloped properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors including market and economic conditions and may result in our investment not being profitable in deciding whether to develop or redevelop a particular property we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring the property up to the standards established for its intended market position or may be unable to increase occupancy at a newly developed property as quickly as expected or at all any substantial unanticipated delays or expenses could adversely affect the investment returns from these development or redevelopment projects and harm our operating results liquidity and financial condition which could result in a decline in the value of our securities 

we may rely on the investments of our joint venture partners for funding certain of our development and redevelopment projects if our reputation in the selfstorage industry changes or the number of investors considering us an attractive strategic partner is otherwise reduced our ability to develop or redevelop properties could be affected which would limit our growth 

risks related to our organization and structure 

our business could be harmed if key personnel with longstanding business relationships in the selfstorage industry terminate their employment with us 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of members of our executive management team our executive management team has substantial experience in the selfstorage industry in addition our ability to acquire or develop properties in the future depends on the significant relationships our executive management team has developed with our institutional joint venture partners such as affiliates of prudential financial inc there is no guarantee that any of them will remain employed by us we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers the loss of services of one or more members of our executive management team could harm our business and our prospects 

we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business without stockholder consent which may subject us to different risks 

we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business at any time without the consent of our stockholders which could result in our making investments and engaging in business activities that are different from and possibly riskier than the investments and businesses described in this document a change in our investment strategy or our entry into new lines of business may increase our exposure to other risks or real estate market fluctuations 

if other selfstorage companies convert to an upreit structure or if tax laws change we may no longer have an advantage in competing for potential acquisitions 

because we are structured as an upreit we are a more attractive acquirer of properties to taxmotivated sellers than our competitors that are not structured as upreits however if other selfstorage companies restructure their holdings to become upreits this competitive advantage will disappear in addition new legislation may be enacted or new interpretations of existing legislation may be issued by the internal revenue service irs or the us treasury department that could affect the attractiveness of our upreit structure so that it may no longer assist us in competing for acquisitions 

tax indemnification obligations may require the operating partnership to maintain certain debt levels 

we have provided certain tax protections to various third parties in connection with their property contributions to the operating partnership upon acquisition by the company including making available the opportunity to 1 guarantee debt or 2 enter into a special loss allocation and deficit restoration obligation we have agreed to these provisions in order to assist these contributors in preserving their tax position after their contributions these obligations may require us to maintain certain indebtedness levels that we would not otherwise require for our business 

our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority 

as of december 31 2010 we held interests in 365 operating properties through joint ventures some of these arrangements could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority our reliance on coventurers financial conditions and disputes between us and our coventurers we expect to continue our joint venture strategy by entering into more joint ventures for the purpose of developing new selfstorage properties and acquiring existing properties in such event we would not be in a position to exercise sole decisionmaking authority regarding the property partnership joint venture or other entity the decisionmaking authority regarding the properties we currently hold through joint ventures is either vested exclusively with our joint venture partners is subject to a majority vote of the joint venture partners or equally shared by us and the joint venture partners in 

addition investments in partnerships joint ventures or other entities may under certain circumstances involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or coventurers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions partners or coventurers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions such as a sale because neither we nor the partner or coventurer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or coventurers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers andor directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or coventurers might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our thirdparty partners or coventurers which could harm our financial condition 

spencer f kirk chairman and chief executive officer kent w christensen executive vice president and chief financial officer charles l allen executive vice president and chief legal officer and other members of our senior management team have outside business interests which could divert their time and attention away from us which could harm our business 

spencer f kirk our chairman and chief executive officer as well as certain other members of our senior management team have outside business interests these business interests include the ownership of a selfstorage property located in pico rivera california other than this property the members of our senior management are not currently engaged in any other selfstorage activities outside the company these outside business interests could interfere with their ability to devote time to our business and affairs as a result our business could be harmed 

conflicts of interest could arise as a result of our relationship with our operating partnership 

conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates and our operating partnership or any partner thereof our directors and officers have duties to our company under applicable maryland law in connection with their management of our company at the same time we through our whollyowned subsidiary have fiduciary duties as a general partner to our operating partnership and to the limited partners under delaware law in connection with the management of our operating partnership our duties through our whollyowned subsidiary as a general partner to our operating partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our company the partnership agreement of our operating partnership does not require us to resolve such conflicts in favor of either our company or the limited partners in our operating partnership unless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement delaware law generally requires a general partner of a delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith fairness and loyalty and which generally prohibit such general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest 

additionally the partnership agreement expressly limits our liability by providing that neither we our direct whollyowned massachusetts business trust subsidiary as the general partner of the operating partnership nor any of our or their trustees directors or officers will be liable or accountable in damages to our operating partnership the limited partners or assignees for errors in judgment mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if we or such trustee director or officer acted in good faith in addition our operating partnership is required to indemnify us our affiliates and each of our respective trustees officers directors employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against any and all losses claims damages liabilities whether joint or several expenses including without limitation attorneys fees and other legal fees and expenses 

judgments fines settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims demands actions suits or proceedings civil criminal administrative or investigative that relate to the operations of the operating partnership provided that our operating partnership will not indemnify for 1 willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law 2 any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement or 3 in the case of a criminal proceeding the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful 

the provisions of delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement 

we may pursue less vigorous enforcement of terms of contribution and other agreements because of conflicts of interest with certain of our officers 

spencer f kirk chairman and chief executive officer kent w christensen executive vice president and chief financial officer charles l allen executive vice president and chief legal officer other members of our senior management team and kenneth m woolley director had direct or indirect ownership interests in certain properties that were contributed to our operating partnership in the formation transactions following the completion of the formation transactions we under the agreements relating to the contribution of such interests became entitled to indemnification and damages in the event of breaches of representations or warranties made by the contributors none of these contribution and noncompetition agreements was negotiated at an armslength basis we may choose not to enforce or to enforce less vigorously our rights under these contribution and noncompetition agreements because of our desire to maintain our ongoing relationships with the individuals party to these agreements 

certain provisions of maryland law and our organizational documents including the stock ownership limit imposed by our charter may inhibit market activity in our stock and could prevent or delay a change in control transaction 

our charter subject to certain exceptions authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a reit and to limit any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding common stock or 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limit however our board of directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership limit to any proposed transferee whose ownership could jeopardize our qualification as a reit these restrictions on ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the ownership limit may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders different ownership limits apply to the family of kenneth m woolley certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and spencer f kirk certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and certain designated investment entities as defined in our charter 

our board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder approval in addition our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares our board of directors could issue additional shares of our common stock or establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise not be in the best interests of our stockholders 

our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited 

maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances in addition our charter eliminates our directors and officers liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law as a result we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law in addition we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers 

to the extent our distributions represent a return of capital for us federal income tax purposes our stockholders could recognize an increased capital gain upon a subsequent sale of common stock 

distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and not treated by us as a dividend will not be taxable to a us stockholder under current us federal income tax law to the extent those distributions do not exceed the stockholders adjusted tax basis in his her or its common stock but instead will constitute a return of capital and will reduce such adjusted basis if distributions result in a reduction of a stockholders adjusted basis in such holders common stock subsequent sales of such holders common stock will result in recognition of an increased capital gain or decreased capital loss due to the reduction in such adjusted basis 

risks related to the real estate industry 

our primary business involves the ownership and operation of selfstorage properties 

our current strategy is to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop only selfstorage properties consequently we are subject to risks inherent in investments in a single industry because investments in real estate are inherently illiquid this strategy makes it difficult for us to diversify our investment portfolio and to limit our risk when economic conditions change decreases in market rents negative tax real estate and zoning law changes and changes in environmental protection laws may also increase our costs lower the value of our investments and decrease our income which would adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties 

because real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in our portfolio in response to changing economic financial and investment conditions is 

limited the real estate market is affected by many factors such as general economic conditions availability of financing interest rates and other factors including supply and demand that are beyond our control we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property 

we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold we cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements in acquiring a property we may agree to transfer restrictions that materially restrict us from selling that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property these transfer restrictions would impede our ability to sell a property even if we deem it necessary or appropriate 

any investments in unimproved real property may take significantly longer to yield incomeproducing returns if at all and may result in additional costs to us to comply with rezoning restrictions or environmental regulations 

we have invested in the past and may invest in the future in unimproved real property unimproved properties generally take longer to yield incomeproducing returns based on the typical time required for development any development of unimproved property may also expose us to the risks and uncertainties associated with rezoning the land for a higher use or development and environmental concerns of governmental entities andor community groups any unsuccessful investments or delays in realizing an incomeproducing return or increased costs to develop unimproved real estate could restrict our ability to earn our targeted rate of return on an investment or adversely affect our ability to pay operating expenses which would harm our financial condition and operating results 

any negative perceptions of the selfstorage industry generally may result in a decline in our stock price 

to the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the selfstorage industry the value of our securities may be negatively impacted which could result in our securities trading below the inherent value of our assets 

risks related to our debt financings 

disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us 

the united states credit markets have experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to refinance existing debt maturities on favorable terms or at all which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions and fund development projects a prolonged downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing these events in the credit markets have also had an adverse effect on other financial markets in the united states which may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common 

stock preferred stock or other equity securities these disruptions in the financial markets may have other adverse effects on us or the economy generally which could cause our stock price to decline 

required payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our properties or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 12 billion of outstanding indebtedness we may incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions and development we may borrow under our credit lines or borrow new funds to finance these future properties additionally we do not anticipate that our internally generated cash flow will be adequate to repay our existing indebtedness upon maturity and therefore we expect to repay our indebtedness through refinancings and equity andor debt offerings further we may need to borrow funds in order to make cash distributions to maintain our qualification as a reit or to make our expected distributions 

if we are required to utilize our credit lines for purposes other than acquisition activity this will reduce the amount available for acquisitions and could slow our growth therefore our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences including the following 

• our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments • we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms including to make acquisitions or to continue to make distributions required to maintain our qualification as a reit • we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness • because a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates an increase in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense • we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties possibly on disadvantageous terms • after debt service the amount available for cash distributions to our stockholders is reduced • our debt level could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt • we may experience increased vulnerability to economic and industry downturns reducing our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions • we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases • we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgages may enforce our guarantees • we may violate restrictive covenants in our loan documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations and • our default under any one of our mortgage loans with crossdefault or crosscollateralization provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness or result in the foreclosures of other properties 19 

we could become highly leveraged in the future because our organizational documents contain no limitation on the amount of debt we may incur 

our organizational documents contain no limitations on the amount of indebtedness that we or our operating partnership may incur we could alter the balance between our total outstanding indebtedness and the value of our portfolio at any time if we become more highly leveraged then the resulting increase in debt service could adversely affect our ability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness and to pay our anticipated cash distributions andor to continue to make cash distributions to maintain our reit qualification and could harm our financial condition 

increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and make cash distributions to our stockholders 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 12 billion of debt outstanding of which approximately 4299 million or 344 was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps this variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 31 per annum increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase our interest expense which could harm our cash flow and our ability to pay cash distributions for example if market rates of interest on this variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points excluding variable rate debt with interest rate floors the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 34 million annually 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations 

in certain cases we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements hedging involves risks such as the risk that the counterparty may fail to honor its obligations under an arrangement failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders 

risks related to qualification and operation as a reit 

to maintain our qualification as a reit we may be forced to borrow funds on a shortterm basis during unfavorable market conditions 

to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our net taxable income each year excluding net capital gains and we are subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income each year in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions made by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years while historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our shareholders a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances its own stock for distributions with respect to taxable years ending on or before december 31 2011 recent internal revenue service guidance allows us to satisfy up to 90 of the distribution requirements discussed above through the distribution of shares of our stock if certain conditions are met assuming we continue to satisfy these distributions requirements with cash we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis or possibly longterm to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these borrowing needs could result from a difference in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for us federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt amortization payments 

dividends payable by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates 

the maximum us federal income tax rate for dividends paid by domestic corporations to individual us stockholders is 15 through 2012 dividends paid by reits however are generally not eligible for the reduced rates the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause stockholders who are individuals to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits including our securities 

in addition the relative attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends which could negatively affect the value of our properties 

possible legislative or other actions affecting reits could adversely affect our stockholders 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us treasury department changes to tax laws which changes may have retroactive application could adversely affect our stockholders it cannot be predicted whether when in what forms or with what effective dates the tax laws applicable to us or our stockholders will be changed 

the power of our board of directors to revoke our reit election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders 

our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election without the approval of our stockholders if it determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a reit if we cease to qualify as a reit we would become subject to us federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our net taxable income to our stockholders which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholders 

our failure to qualify as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock 

we believe we operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit or lose our qualification as a reit at any time we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution for each of the years involved because 

• we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates • we also could be subject to the us federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes and • unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following a year during which we were disqualified in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits this means that our us individual stockholders would be taxed on our dividends at capital gains rates and our us corporate stockholders would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends subject in each case to applicable limitations under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and are able to avail ourselves of one or more of the relief 

provisions under the internal revenue code in order to maintain our reit status we may nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of 50000 or more for each such failure as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our securities 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the internal revenue code is greater in the case of a reit that like us holds its assets through a partnership the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the composition of our assets the sources of our gross income and the owners of our stock our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market value of our assets some of which are not susceptible to precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our net taxable income excluding capital gains and we will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income including capital gains in addition legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors our ability to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that is intended to allow us to qualify for taxation as a reit we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the internal revenue service regarding our qualification as a reit 

we will pay some taxes 

even though we qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we will be required to pay some us federal state and local taxes on our income and property extra space management inc manages selfstorage properties for our joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties we jointly with extra space management inc elected to treat extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary of our company for us federal income tax purposes a taxable reit subsidiary is a fully taxable corporation and may be limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to us in addition we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements among our tenants our taxable reit subsidiary and us are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties or if we receive payments for inventory or property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business also if we sell property as a dealer ie to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on any gain arising from such sales while we dont intend to sell properties as a dealer the irs could take a contrary position to the extent that we are or our taxable reit subsidiary is required to pay us federal state or local taxes we will have less cash available for distribution to stockholders 

complying with reit requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 

to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the nature and diversification of our assets the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock in order to meet these tests we may be required to forego attractive business or investment opportunities thus compliance with the reit requirements may adversely affect our ability to operate solely to maximize profits

 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2010 we owned or had ownership interests in 660 operating selfstorage properties of these properties 295 are whollyowned and 365 are held in joint ventures in addition we managed an additional 160 properties for franchisees or third parties bringing the total number of properties which we own andor manage to 820 these properties are located in 34 states and washington dc we receive a management fee equal to approximately 6 of cash collected from total revenues to manage the joint venture third party and franchise sites as of december 31 2010 we own andor manage approximately 59 million square feet of rentable space configured in approximately 550000 separate storage units approximately 70 of our properties are clustered around large population centers such as atlanta baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas houston las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san franciscooakland these markets contain aboveaverage population and income demographics for new selfstorage properties the clustering of assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale our acquisitions have given us an increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in many markets where we had no previous presence 

we consider a property to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization we consider a property to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 or has been open for three years 

as of december 31 2010 over 425000 tenants were leasing storage units at the 820 operating properties that we own andor manage primarily on a monthtomonth basis providing the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit although leases are shortterm in duration the typical tenant tends to remain at our properties for an extended period of time for properties that were stabilized as of december 31 2010 the median length of stay was approximately eleven months the average annual rent per square foot at these stabilized properties was 1349 at december 31 2010 compared to 1346 at december 31 2009 

our property portfolio is made up of different types of construction and building configurations depending on the site and the municipality where it is located most often sites are what we consider hybrid facilities a mix of both driveup buildings and multifloor buildings we have a number of multifloor buildings with elevator access only and a number of facilities featuring groundfloor access only

  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report we make statements in this section that are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws for a complete discussion of forward looking statements see the section in this form 10k entitled statements regarding forwardlooking information certain risk factors may cause actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion for a discussion of such risk factors see the section in this form 10k entitled risk factors amounts in thousands except share and per share data 

overview 

we are a fully integrated selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust or reit formed to continue the business commenced in 1977 by our predecessor companies to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop professionally managed selfstorage properties since our ipo our fully integrated development and acquisition teams have completed the development or acquisition of 536 selfstorage properties 

at december 31 2010 we owned had ownership interests in or managed 820 operating properties in 34 states and washington dc of these 820 operating properties 295 were wholly owned we held joint venture interests in 365 properties and our taxable reit subsidiary extra space management inc operated an additional 160 properties that are owned by franchisees or third parties in exchange for a management fee these operating properties contain approximately 59 million square feet of rentable space contained in approximately 550000 units and currently serve a customer base of over 425000 tenants 

our properties are generally situated in convenient highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as atlanta baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas houston las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san franciscooakland these areas all enjoy above average population growth and income levels the clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale we consider a property to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization a property is considered to be stabilized once it has achieved an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 or has been open for three years 

to maximize the performance of our properties we employ a stateoftheart webbased tracking and yield management technology called store developed by our management team store enables us to analyze set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions in addition we also have an industry leading revenue management system called revman we believe that the combination of stores yield management capabilities and the systematic processes developed by our team using revman allows us to more proactively manage revenues 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under existing leases at each of our selfstorage properties from management fees on the properties we manage for jointventure partners franchisees and unaffiliated third parties and from our tenant reinsurance program our management fee is equal to approximately 6 of cash collected from total revenues generated by the managed properties 

we operate in competitive markets often where consumers have multiple selfstorage properties from which to choose competition has impacted and will continue to impact our property results we experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity our operating results depend materially on our 

ability to lease available selfstorage units to actively manage unit rental rates and on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments we believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the use of store and through the use of revman 

we continue to evaluate and implement a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to enable us to maximize stockholder value our strategies to maximize stockholder value include the following 

• maximize the performance of properties through strategic efficient and proactive management we pursue revenue generating and expense minimizing opportunities in our operations our revenue management team seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our technology systems ability to provide realtime interactive rental rate and discount management our size allows us greater ability than most of our competitors to implement national regional and local marketing programs which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost • expand our management business our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and expand our geographic footprint this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale in addition we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline we pursue strategic relationships with owners that strengthen our acquisition pipeline through agreements which typically give us first right of refusal to purchase the managed property in the event of a potential sale • acquire selfstorage properties from strategic partners and third parties our acquisitions team continues to selectively pursue the acquisition of single properties and multiproperty portfolios that we believe can provide stockholder value we have established a reputation as a reliable ethical buyer which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions in addition our status as an upreit enables flexibility when structuring deals during 2010 we acquired 15 whollyowned properties and completed the development of four whollyowned properties all in our core markets we have six development properties remaining all six are whollyowned and are scheduled for completion by the end of 2011 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those that impact our most critical accounting policies we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies 

consolidation arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as variable interest entities vies an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it is the primary beneficiary of the vie 

a vie is created when i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii the entitys equity holders as a group either a lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance b are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur or c do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur if an entity is deemed to be a vie the enterprise 

that is deemed to have a variable interest or combination of variable interests that provides the enterprise with a controlling financial interest in the vie is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 

we have concluded that under certain circumstances when we 1 enter into option agreements for the purchase of land or facilities from an entity and pay a nonrefundable deposit or 2 enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures a vie may be created under condition i ii b or c of the previous paragraph for each vie created we have performed a qualitative analysis including considering which party if any has the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of each vie and whether that party has the obligation to absorb losses of the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could be significant to the vie if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie the assets liabilities and operations of the vie are consolidated with our financial statements additionally our operating partnership has notes payable to three trusts that are vies under condition iia above since the operating partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts these vies are not consolidated 

real estate assets real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation direct and allowable internal costs associated with the development construction renovation and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized interest property taxes and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized 

expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives depreciation is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements which are generally between five and 39 years 

in connection with our acquisition of properties the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values which are estimated using significant unobservable inputs the value of the tangible assets consisting of land and buildings are determined as if vacant intangible assets which represent the value of existing tenant relationships are recorded at their fair values based on the avoided cost to replace the current leases we measure the value of tenant relationships based on the rent lost due to the amount of time required to replace existing customers which is based on our historical experience with turnover in our facilities debt assumed as part of an acquisition is recorded at fair value based on current interest rates compared to contractual rates acquisitionrelated transaction costs are expensed as incurred 

intangible lease rights include 1 purchase price amounts allocated to leases on two properties that cannot be classified as ground or building leases these rights are amortized to expense over the term of the leases and 2 intangibles related to ground leases on four properties where the ground leases were assumed by the company at rates that were different than the current market rates for similar leases the value associated with these assumed leases were recorded as intangibles which will be amortized over the lease terms 

evaluation of asset impairment we evaluate long lived assets held for use when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment we review each property at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist we focus on properties where occupancy andor rental income have decreased by a significant amount for these properties we determine whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the property will likely recover the lost occupancy andor revenue in the short term in addition we carefully review properties in the leaseup stage and compare actual operating results to original projections 

when we determine that an event that may indicate impairment has occurred we compare the carrying value of the related longlived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets an impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the assets exceeds 

the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the assets 

when real estate assets are identified as held for sale we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the fair value of the assets net of selling costs if the estimated fair values net of selling costs of the assets that have been identified for sale are less than the net carrying value of the assets then a valuation allowance is established the operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are generally presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

fair value of financial instruments the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents restricted cash receivables other financial instruments included in other assets accounts payable and accrued expenses variable rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts lines of credit and other liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2010 and 2009 approximate fair value the fair values of our notes receivable our fixed rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts and exchangeable senior notes are as follows 



investments in real estate ventures our investments in real estate joint ventures where we have significant influence but not control and joint ventures which are vies in which we are not the primary beneficiary are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

under the equity method our investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures for the purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows we follow the look through approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures under this approach distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital eg a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint ventures sale of assets in which case it is reported as an investing activity 

our management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired annually and when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment an investment is impaired if managements estimate of the fair value of the investment using significant unobservable inputs is less than its carrying value to the extent impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment 

derivative instruments and hedging activities the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk are considered fair value hedges derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges 

for derivatives designated as fair value hedges changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings 

conversion of operating partnership units conversions of operating partnership units to common stock when converted under the original provisions of the operating partnership agreement are accounted for by reclassifying the underlying net book value of the units from noncontrolling interest to our equity the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the adjustment to the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest is recognized as additional paid in capital of the company 

revenue and expense recognition rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants leases are generally on monthtomonth terms prepaid rents are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the leases promotional discounts are recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period late charges administrative fees merchandise sales and truck rentals are recognized in income when earned management and franchise fee revenues are recognized monthly as services are performed and in accordance with the terms of the related management agreements tenant reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenues over the period of insurance coverage equity in earnings of real estate entities is recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate entities interest income is recognized as earned 

property expenses including utilities property taxes repairs and maintenance and other costs to manage the facilities are recognized as incurred we accrue for property tax expense based upon invoice amounts estimates and historical trends if these estimates are incorrect the timing of expense recognition could be affected 

real estate sales in general sales of real estate and related profitslosses are recognized when all consideration has changed hands and risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred certain types of continuing involvement preclude sale treatment and related profit recognition other forms of continuing involvement allow for sale recognition but require deferral of profit recognition 

income taxes we have elected to be treated as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code in order to maintain our qualification as a reit among other things we are required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets as a reit we are not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to our stockholders we plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex if we were to fail to meet these requirements we would be subject to federal income tax we are subject to certain state and local taxes provision for such taxes has been included in property operating and general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 

we have elected to treat one of our corporate subsidiaries extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary trs in general our trs may perform additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or nonreal estate related business except for the operation or management of health care facilities or lodging facilities or the provision to any person under a franchise license or otherwise of rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated a trs is subject to corporate federal income tax deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and 

liabilities interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense when incurred 

stockbased compensation the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards to employees and directors are based on estimated fair values awards are valued at fair value and recognized on a straight line basis over the service periods of each award 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in january 2010 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new fair value measurements and disclosures standards to increase the transparency of these measures the standards revise two disclosure requirements concerning fair value measurements and clarify two others they require separate presentation of significant transfers into and out of levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy and disclosure of the reasons for such transfers they will also require the presentation of purchases sales issuances and settlements within level 3 on a gross basis rather than a net basis the amendments also clarify that disclosures should be disaggregated by class of asset or liability and that disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques should be provided for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements these new disclosure requirements were effective for the period ended march 31 2010 except for the requirement concerning gross presentation of level 3 activity which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2010 the adoption of the new standards did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in june 2009 the fasb issued changes to accounting standards codification asc 810 consolidation which amended guidance for determining whether an entity is a vie and requires the performance of a qualitative rather than a quantitative analysis to determine the primary beneficiary of a vie under this guidance an entity would be required to consolidate a vie if it has i the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and ii the obligation to absorb losses of the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could be significant to the vie this guidance became effective for the first annual reporting period that begins after november 15 2009 with early adoption prohibited we adopted this guidance effective january 1 2010 and reviewed the terms of all joint ventures in relation to the new guidance as a result of this analysis we determined that five joint ventures that were consolidated under the previous accounting guidance should be deconsolidated as of january 1 2010 the assets and liabilities associated with these joint ventures were removed from our financial statements and our investments in these joint ventures were recorded under the equity method of accounting during the year ended december 31 2010

funds from operations 

ffo provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary along with net income and cash flows for an understanding of our operating results we believe ffo is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings net earnings assume that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses the values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and we believe ffo more accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts inc nareit as net income computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap excluding gains or losses on sales of operating properties plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis we believe that to further understand our performance ffo should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with gaap as presented in the consolidated financial statements 

the computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance as an alternative to net cash flow from

we expect to fund our shortterm liquidity requirements including operating expenses recurring capital expenditures dividends to stockholders distributions to holders of op units and interest on our outstanding indebtedness out of our operating cash flow cash on hand and borrowings under our credit lines in addition we are actively pursuing additional term loans secured by unencumbered properties 

our liquidity needs consist primarily of cash distributions to stockholders facility development property acquisitions principal payments under our borrowings and nonrecurring capital expenditures we may from time to time seek to repurchase or redeem our outstanding debt shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases or redemptions if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors in addition we evaluate on an ongoing basis the merits of strategic acquisitions and other relationships which may require us to raise additional funds we do not expect that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs and instead expect to fund such needs out of additional borrowings of secured or unsecured indebtedness joint ventures with third parties and from the proceeds of public and private offerings of equity and debt additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all any additional issuance of equity or equitylinked securities may result in dilution to our stockholders in addition any new securities we issue could have rights preferences and privileges senior to holders of our common stock we may also use op units as currency to fund acquisitions from selfstorage owners who desire taxdeferral in their exiting transactions 

the us credit markets have experienced dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen these circumstances have impacted liquidity in the 

debt markets making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and fund development projects in addition the financial condition of the lenders of our credit facilities may worsen to the point that they default on their obligations to make available to us the funds under those facilities a prolonged downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing these events in the credit markets have also had an adverse affect on other financial markets in the united states which may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock preferred stock or other equity securities these disruptions in the financial market may have other adverse effects on us or the economy generally which could cause our stock price to decline

financing strategy 

we will continue to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts reviewed from time to time by our board of directors although our board of directors has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur we will consider a number of factors in evaluating 

our level of indebtedness from time to time as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or variable rate in making financing decisions we will consider factors including but not limited to 

• the interest rate of the proposed financing • the extent to which the financing impacts flexibility in managing our properties • prepayment penalties and restrictions on refinancing • the purchase price of properties acquired with debt financing • longterm objectives with respect to the financing • target investment returns • the ability of particular properties and our company as a whole to generate cash flow sufficient to cover expected debt service payments • overall level of consolidated indebtedness • timing of debt and lease maturities • provisions that require recourse and crosscollateralization • corporate credit ratios including debt service coverage debt to total capitalization and debt to undepreciated assets and • the overall ratio of fixed and variable rate debt our indebtedness may be recourse nonrecourse or crosscollateralized if the indebtedness is nonrecourse the collateral will be limited to the particular properties to which the indebtedness relates in addition we may invest in properties subject to existing loans collateralized by mortgages or similar liens on our properties or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis we may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness to refinance investments including the redevelopment of existing properties for general working capital or to purchase additional interests in partnerships or joint ventures or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable 

during 2008 and 2009 we repurchased 162337 in aggregate principal amount of our exchangeable senior notes on the open market for 119455 in cash we may from time to time seek to retire repurchase or redeem our additional outstanding debt including our exchangeable senior notes as well as shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases or redemptions if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our future income cash flows and fair values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary and tax policies domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 12 billion in total debt of which approximately 4299 million was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt excluding variable rate debt with interest rate floors would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 34 million annually 

interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur further in the event of a change of that magnitude we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure

industry  competition 

selfstorage facilities refers to properties that offer monthtomonth storage space rental for personal or business use selfstorage offers a costeffective and flexible storage alternative tenants rent fully enclosed spaces that can vary in size according to their specific needs and to which they have unlimited exclusive access tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units selfstorage unit sizes typically range from five feet by five feet to 20 feet by 20 feet with an interior height of eight to 12 feet properties generally have onsite managers who supervise and run the daytoday operations providing tenants with assistance as needed 

selfstorage provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions due to life changes or simply because of a need for storage space the mix of residential tenants using a selfstorage property is determined by a propertys local demographics and often includes people who are looking to downsize their living space or others who are not yet settled into a permanent residence items that residential tenants place in selfstorage properties range from cars boats and recreational vehicles to furniture household items and appliances commercial tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods records inventory or storage for seasonal goods 

our research has shown that tenants choose a selfstorage property based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or business making highdensity hightraffic population centers ideal locations for selfstorage properties a propertys perceived security and the general professionalism of the site managers and staff are also contributing factors to a sites ability to successfully secure rentals although most selfstorage properties are leased to tenants on a monthtomonth basis tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time 

there are seasonal fluctuations in occupancy rates for selfstorage properties based on our experience generally there is increased leasing activity at selfstorage properties during the summer months due to the higher number of people who relocate during this period the highest level of occupancy is typically at the end of july while the lowest level of occupancy is seen in late february and early march 

since inception in the early 1970s the selfstorage industry has experienced significant growth in the past ten years there has been even greater growth according to the selfstorage almanac the 

almanac in 1999 there were only 29955 selfstorage properties in the united states with an average occupancy rate of 869 of net rentable square feet compared to 48721 selfstorage properties in 2009 with an average occupancy rate of 767 of net rentable square feet as population densities have increased in the united states there has been an increase in selfstorage awareness and corresponding development which we expect will continue in the future 

increased competition has affected our business and has led to both pricing and discount pressure the increased competition has limited our ability to increase revenues in many markets in which we operate many markets have been able to absorb the increase in selfstorage development due to superior demographics and density however select markets have not been able to absorb the new facilities and have not performed as well 

we have encountered competition when we have sought to acquire properties especially for brokered portfolios aggressive bidding practices have been commonplace between both public and private entities and this competition will likely continue to be a challenge for the companys growth strategy 

the industry is also characterized by fragmented ownership according to the almanac the top ten selfstorage companies in the united states owned approximately 108 of total us selfstorage properties and the top 50 selfstorage companies owned approximately 149 of the total us properties as of december 31 2009 we believe this fragmentation will contribute to continued consolidation at some level in the future we also believe that we are well positioned to be able to compete for acquisitions given our historical reputation for closing deals 

we are the second largest selfstorage operator in the united states we are one of four public selfstorage reits along with public storage inc sovran selfstorage inc and ustoreit inc 

longterm growth and investment strategies 

our primary business objectives are to maximize cash flow available for distribution to our stockholders and to achieve sustainable longterm growth in cash flow per share in order to maximize longterm stockholder value we continue to evaluate a range of growth initiatives and opportunities including the following 

• maximize the performance of properties through strategic efficient and proactive management we plan to pursue revenue generating and expense minimizing opportunities in our operations our revenue management team will seek to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our technology systems ability to provide realtime interactive rental rate and discount management our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement national regional and local marketing programs which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost • expand our management business our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and expand our geographic footprint this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale in addition we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline we pursue strategic relationships with owners that strengthen our acquisition pipeline through agreements which give us first right of refusal to purchase the managed property in the event of a potential sale • acquire selfstorage properties from strategic partners and third parties our acquisitions team will continue to selectively pursue the acquisition of single properties and multiproperty portfolios that we believe can provide stockholder value we believe we have established a reputation as a reliable ethical buyer which enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions in addition our status as an upreit enables flexibility when structuring deals 6 

financing of our longterm growth strategies 

• acquisition and development financing we currently have a 1000 million revolving line of credit the credit line that is collateralized by certain of our selfstorage properties as of december 31 2009 the credit line had asset collateralizing capacity of 1000 million of which 1000 million was drawn on february 13 2009 we entered into a 500 million revolving secured line of credit the secondary credit line and together with the credit line collectively the credit lines that is collateralized by certain of our selfstorage properties as of december 31 2009 the secondary credit line had asset collateralizing capacity of approximately 500 million of which 0 was drawn we expect to maintain a flexible approach in financing new property acquisitions we plan to finance future acquisitions and development through a combination of cash borrowings under the credit lines traditional secured mortgage financing joint ventures and additional equity offerings 

• joint venture financing we own 336 of our stabilized properties and 16 of our leaseup properties through joint ventures with third parties including affiliates of prudential financial inc in each joint venture we generally manage the daytoday operations of the underlying properties and have the right to participate in major decisions relating to sales of properties or financings by the applicable joint venture our joint venture partners typically provide most of the equity capital required for the operation of the respective business under the operating agreements for the joint ventures we typically maintain the right to receive between 170 and 500 of the available cash flow from operations after our joint venture partners and the company have received a predetermined return and between 170 and 500 of the available cash flow from capital transactions after our joint venture partners and the company have received a return of their capital plus such predetermined return most joint venture agreements include buysell rights as well as rights of first refusal in connection with the sale of properties by the joint venture 

• disposition of properties we will continue to review our portfolio for properties or groups of properties that are not strategically located and determine whether to dispose of these properties to fund other growth 

regulation 

generally selfstorage properties are subject to various laws ordinances and regulations including regulations relating to lien sale rights and procedures changes in any of these laws or regulations as well as changes in laws such as the comprehensive environmental response and compensation liability act cercla which increase the potential liability for environmental conditions or circumstances existing or created by tenants or others on properties or laws affecting development construction operation upkeep safety and taxation may result in significant unanticipated expenditures loss of selfstorage sites or other impairments to operations which would adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

under the americans with disabilities act of 1990 the ada all places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these requirements became effective in 1992 a number of additional us federal state and local laws also exist that may require modifications to the properties or restrict further renovations thereof with respect to access thereto by disabled persons noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature thereby requiring substantial capital expenditures to the extent our properties are not in compliance we are likely to incur additional costs to comply with the ada 

insurance activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state in accordance with the mccarranferguson act and are subject to the grammleachbliley act and the privacy regulations promulgated by the federal trade commission pursuant thereto 

property management activities are often subject to state real estate brokerage laws and regulations as determined by the particular real estate commission for each state 

changes in any of the laws governing our conduct could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business or could materially affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

employees 

as of february 12 2010 we had 2001 employees and believe our relationship with our employees to be good our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement 




 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our securities involves various risks all investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information contained in this annual report before trading in our securities if any of the events set forth in the following risks actually occur our business operating results prospects and financial condition could be harmed 

our performance is subject to risks associated with real estate investments we are a real estate company that derives our income from operation of our properties there are a number of factors that may adversely affect the income that our properties generate including the following 

risks related to our properties and operations 

adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating results 

our operating results are dependent upon our ability to maximize occupancy levels and rental rates in our selfstorage properties adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we operate may lower our occupancy levels and limit our ability to increase rents or require us to offer rental discounts if our properties fail to generate revenues sufficient to meet our cash requirements including operating and other expenses debt service and capital expenditures our net income funds from operations ffo cash flow financial condition ability to make cash distributions to stockholders and the trading price of our securities could be adversely affected the following factors among others may adversely affect the operating performance of our properties 

• the national economic climate and the local or regional economic climate in the markets in which we operate which may be adversely impacted by among other factors industry slowdowns relocation of businesses and changing demographics • periods of economic slowdown or recession rising interest rates or declining demand for selfstorage or the public perception that any of these events may occur could result in a general decline in rental rates or an increase in tenant defaults • the continuation or worsening of the current economic environment • local or regional real estate market conditions such as competing properties the oversupply of selfstorage or a reduction in demand for selfstorage in a particular area • perceptions by prospective users of our selfstorage properties of the safety convenience and attractiveness of our properties and the neighborhoods in which they are located 8 

• increased operating costs including the need for capital improvements insurance premiums real estate taxes and utilities • the impact of environmental protection laws • earthquakes hurricanes and other natural disasters terrorist acts civil disturbances or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses and • changes in tax real estate and zoning laws recent us and international market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower growth through the third and fourth quarters of 2008 and all of 2009 for the year ended december 31 2009 continued concerns about the systemic impact of inflation energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit and other macroeconomic factors have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the global economy and increased market uncertainty and instability continued turbulence in us and international markets may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the financial condition of our customers if these market conditions continue they may result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to promptly relet our units or if the rates upon such reletting are significantly lower than expected then our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

virtually all of our leases are on a monthtomonth basis any delay in reletting units as vacancies arise would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results in addition lower than expected rental rates upon reletting could adversely affect our revenues and impede our growth 

we depend upon our onsite personnel to maximize tenant satisfaction at each of our properties and any difficulties we encounter in hiring training and maintaining skilled field personnel may harm our operating performance 

we had 1684 field personnel as of february 12 2010 in the management and operation of our properties the general professionalism of our site managers and staff are contributing factors to a sites ability to successfully secure rentals and retain tenants we also rely upon our field personnel to maintain clean and secure selfstorage properties if we are unable to successfully recruit train and retain qualified field personnel the quality of service we strive to provide at our properties could be adversely affected which could lead to decreased occupancy levels and reduced operating performance 

uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flow 

we maintain comprehensive liability fire flood earthquake wind as deemed necessary or as required by our lenders extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our properties certain types of losses however may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable such as losses due to earthquakes hurricanes tornadoes riots acts of war or terrorism should an uninsured loss occur we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a property in addition if any such loss is insured we may be required to pay significant amounts on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to our insurer being obligated to reimburse us for the loss or the amount of the loss may exceed our coverage for the loss as a result our operating results may be adversely affected 

increases in taxes and regulatory compliance costs may reduce our income 

costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws generally are not passed through to tenants directly and will affect us increases in income property or other taxes generally are not passed through 

to tenants under leases and may reduce our net income ffo cash flow financial condition ability to pay or refinance our debt obligations ability to make cash distributions to stockholders and the trading price of our securities similarly changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which could similarly adversely affect our business and results of operations 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our properties may affect our results of operations 

under various us federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations owners and operators of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigating and remediating certain hazardous substances or other regulated materials on or in such property such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such substances or materials the presence of such substances or materials or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owners or operators ability to lease sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances or other regulated materials may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials into the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with asbestoscontaining materials 

certain environmental laws also impose liability without regard to knowledge or fault for removal or remediation of hazardous substances or other regulated materials upon owners and operators of contaminated property even after they no longer own or operate the property moreover the past or present owner or operator from which a release emanates could be liable for any personal injuries or property damages that may result from such releases as well as any damages to natural resources that may arise from such releases 

certain environmental laws impose compliance obligations on owners and operators of real property with respect to the management of hazardous materials and other regulated substances for example environmental laws govern the management of asbestoscontaining materials and leadbased paint failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties or other sanctions 

no assurances can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner or operator of our properties did not create any material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our properties there also exists the risk that material environmental conditions liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future finally future laws ordinances or regulations and future interpretations of existing laws ordinances or regulations may impose additional material environmental liability 

costs associated with complying with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 may result in unanticipated expenses 

under the ada all places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these requirements became effective in 1992 a number of additional us federal state and local laws may also require modifications to our properties or restrict certain further renovations of the properties with respect to access thereto by disabled persons noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature 

which could result in substantial capital expenditures we have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine our compliance and we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with the ada or other legislation if one or more of our properties is not in compliance with the ada or other legislation then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the facility into compliance if we incur substantial costs to comply with the ada or other legislation our financial condition results of operations cash flow per share trading price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make cash distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected 

our investments in development and redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns which would harm our operating results and reduce the amount of funds available for distributions 

to the extent that we engage in development and redevelopment activities we will be subject to the following risks normally associated with these projects 

• we may be unable to obtain financing for these projects on favorable terms or at all • we may not complete development projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts • we may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning land use building occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations and • occupancy rates and rents at newly developed or redeveloped properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors including market and economic conditions and may result in our investment not being profitable in deciding whether to develop or redevelop a particular property we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring the property up to the standards established for its intended market position or may be unable to increase occupancy at a newly acquired property as quickly as expected or at all any substantial unanticipated delays or expenses could adversely affect the investment returns from these development or redevelopment projects and harm our operating results liquidity and financial condition which could result in a decline in the value of our securities 

we may rely on the investments of our joint venture partners for funding certain of our development and redevelopment projects if our reputation in the selfstorage industry changes or the number of investors considering us an attractive strategic partner is otherwise reduced our ability to develop or redevelop properties could be affected which would limit our growth 

we face competition for the acquisition of selfstorage properties and other assets which may impede our ability to make future acquisitions or may increase the cost of these acquisitions 

we compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of selfstorage properties and other assets including national regional and local operators and developers of selfstorage properties these competitors may drive up the price we must pay for selfstorage properties or other assets we seek to acquire or may succeed in acquiring those properties or assets themselves in addition our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive suitors because they may have greater resources may be willing to pay more or may have a more compatible operating philosophy in addition the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment properties may increase this competition would result in increased demand for these assets and therefore increased prices paid for them because of an increased interest in singleproperty acquisitions among taxmotivated individual purchasers we may pay higher prices if we purchase single properties in comparison with portfolio acquisitions if we pay higher prices for selfstorage properties or other assets our profitability will be reduced 

we may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria which may impede our growth 

our ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy we may not be successful in identifying suitable properties or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms or at all failure to identify or consummate acquisitions will slow our growth which could in turn adversely affect our stock price 

our ability to acquire properties on favorable terms and successfully integrate and operate them may be constrained by the following significant risks 

• competition from local investors and other real estate investors with significant capital including other publiclytraded reits and institutional investment funds • competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price which could reduce our profitability • the inability to achieve satisfactory completion of due diligence investigations and other customary closing conditions • failure to finance an acquisition on favorable terms or at all • we may spend more than the time and amounts budgeted to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties and • we may acquire properties subject to liabilities without any recourse or with only limited recourse with respect to unknown liabilities such as liabilities for cleanup of undisclosed environmental contamination claims by persons dealing with the former owners of the properties and claims for indemnification by general partners directors officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties in addition strategic decisions by us such as acquisitions may adversely affect the price of our securities 

we may not be successful in integrating and operating acquired properties 

we expect to make future acquisitions of selfstorage properties if we acquire any selfstorage properties we will be required to integrate them into our existing portfolio the acquired properties may turn out to be less compatible with our growth strategy than originally anticipated may cause disruptions in our operations or may divert managements attention away from daytoday operations which could impair our results of operations as a whole 

we do not always obtain independent appraisals of our properties and thus the consideration paid for these properties may exceed the value that may be indicated by thirdparty appraisals 

we do not always obtain thirdparty appraisals in connection with our acquisition of properties and the consideration being paid by us in exchange for those properties may exceed the value as determined by thirdparty appraisals in such cases the terms of any agreements and the valuation methods used to determine the value of the properties were determined by our senior management team 

risks related to our organization and structure 

our business could be harmed if key personnel with longstanding business relationships in the selfstorage industry terminate their employment with us 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of members of our executive management team our executive management team has substantial experience in the selfstorage industry in addition our ability to develop properties in the future depends on the significant relationships our executive management team has developed with our institutional joint venture partners such as affiliates of prudential financial inc there is no guarantee that any of them will remain employed by us we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers the loss of services of one or more members of our executive management team could harm our business and our prospects 

we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business without stockholder consent which may subject us to different risks 

we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business at any time without the consent of our stockholders which could result in our making investments and engaging in business activities that are different from and possibly riskier than the investments and businesses described in this document a change in our investment strategy or our entry into new lines of business may increase our exposure to other risks or real estate market fluctuations 

if other selfstorage companies convert to an upreit structure or if tax laws change we may no longer have an advantage in competing for potential acquisitions 

because we are structured as an upreit we are a more attractive acquirer of properties to taxmotivated sellers than our competitors that are not structured as upreits however if other selfstorage companies restructure their holdings to become upreits this competitive advantage will disappear in addition new legislation may be enacted or new interpretations of existing legislation may be issued by the internal revenue service irs or the us treasury department that could affect the attractiveness of our upreit structure so that it may no longer assist us in competing for acquisitions 

tax indemnification obligations may require the operating partnership to maintain certain debt levels 

in connection with the formation transactions entered into prior to our ipo in 2004 we agreed to make available to each of kenneth m woolley a director and our former chairman and chief executive officer richard s tanner our senior vice president development and other third parties the following tax protections for nine years with a threeyear extension if the applicable party continues to own at least 50 of the units in our operating partnership op units received by it in the formation transactions at the expiration of the initial nineyear period the opportunity to 1 guarantee debt or 2 enter into a special loss allocation and deficit restoration obligation in an aggregate amount with respect to the foregoing contributors of at least 600 million similar tax protections were provided to third party contributors in connection with property contributions to the operating partnership subsequent to the ipo we agreed to these provisions in order to assist these contributors in preserving their tax position after their contributions these obligations may require us to maintain certain indebtedness levels that we would not otherwise require for our business 

our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority 

as of december 31 2009 we held interests in 352 operating properties through joint ventures some of these arrangements could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority our reliance on coventurers financial conditions and disputes between us and our coventurers we 

expect to continue our joint venture strategy by entering into more joint ventures for the purpose of developing new selfstorage properties and acquiring existing properties in such event we would not be in a position to exercise sole decisionmaking authority regarding the property partnership joint venture or other entity the decisionmaking authority regarding the properties we currently hold through joint ventures is either vested exclusively with our joint venture partners is subject to a majority vote of the joint venture partners or equally shared by us and the joint venture partners in addition investments in partnerships joint ventures or other entities may under certain circumstances involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or coventurers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions partners or coventurers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions such as a sale because neither we nor the partner or coventurer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or coventurers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers andor directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or coventurers might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our thirdparty partners or coventurers which could harm our financial condition 

spencer f kirk chairman and chief executive officer kent w christensen executive vice president and chief financial officer charles l allen executive vice president and chief legal officer and other members of our senior management team have outside business interests which could divert their time and attention away from us which could harm our business 

spencer f kirk our chairman and chief executive officer as well as certain other members of our senior management team have outside business interests these business interests include the ownership of a selfstorage property located in pico rivera california other than this property the members of our senior management are not currently engaged in any other selfstorage activities outside the company these outside business interests could interfere with their ability to devote time to our business and affairs as a result our business could be harmed 

conflicts of interest could arise as a result of our relationship with our operating partnership 

conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates and our operating partnership or any partner thereof our directors and officers have duties to our company under applicable maryland law in connection with their management of our company at the same time we through our whollyowned subsidiary have fiduciary duties as a general partner to our operating partnership and to the limited partners under delaware law in connection with the management of our operating partnership our duties through our whollyowned subsidiary as a general partner to our operating partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our company the partnership agreement of our operating partnership does not require us to resolve such conflicts in favor of either our company or the limited partners in our operating partnership unless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement delaware law generally requires a general partner of a delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith fairness and loyalty and which generally prohibit such general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest 

additionally the partnership agreement expressly limits our liability by providing that neither we our direct whollyowned massachusetts business trust subsidiary as the general partner of the operating partnership nor any of our or their trustees directors or officers will be liable or 

accountable in damages to our operating partnership the limited partners or assignees for errors in judgment mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if we or such trustee director or officer acted in good faith in addition our operating partnership is required to indemnify us our affiliates and each of our respective trustees officers directors employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against any and all losses claims damages liabilities whether joint or several expenses including without limitation attorneys fees and other legal fees and expenses judgments fines settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims demands actions suits or proceedings civil criminal administrative or investigative that relate to the operations of the operating partnership provided that our operating partnership will not indemnify for 1 willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law 2 any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement or 3 in the case of a criminal proceeding the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful 

the provisions of delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement 

we may pursue less vigorous enforcement of terms of contribution and other agreements because of conflicts of interest with certain of our officers 

spencer f kirk chairman and chief executive officer kent w christensen executive vice president and chief financial officer charles l allen executive vice president and chief legal officer and other members of our senior management team and kenneth m woolley director had direct or indirect ownership interests in certain properties that were contributed to our operating partnership in the formation transactions following the completion of the formation transactions we under the agreements relating to the contribution of such interests became entitled to indemnification and damages in the event of breaches of representations or warranties made by the contributors none of these contribution and noncompetition agreements was negotiated at an armslength basis we may choose not to enforce or to enforce less vigorously our rights under these contribution and noncompetition agreements because of our desire to maintain our ongoing relationships with the individuals party to these agreements 

certain provisions of maryland law and our organizational documents including the stock ownership limit imposed by our charter may inhibit market activity in our stock and could prevent or delay a change in control transaction 

our charter subject to certain exceptions authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a reit and to limit any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding common stock or 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limit however our board of directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership limit to any proposed transferee whose ownership could jeopardize our qualification as a reit these restrictions on ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the ownership limit may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders different ownership limits apply to the family of kenneth m woolley certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and spencer f kirk certain of his 

affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and certain designated investment entities as defined in our charter 

our board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder approval in addition our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares our board of directors could issue additional shares of our common stock or establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise not be in the best interests of our stockholders 

our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited 

maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances in addition our charter eliminates our directors and officers liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law as a result we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law in addition we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers 

to the extent our distributions represent a return of capital for us federal income tax purposes our stockholders could recognize an increased capital gain upon a subsequent sale of common stock 

distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and not treated by us as a dividend will not be taxable to a us stockholder under current us federal income tax law to the extent those distributions do not exceed the stockholders adjusted tax basis in his her or its common stock but instead will constitute a return of capital and will reduce such adjusted basis if distributions result in a reduction of a stockholders adjusted basis in such holders common stock subsequent sales of such holders common stock will result in recognition of an increased capital gain or decreased capital loss due to the reduction in such adjusted basis 

risks related to the real estate industry 

our primary business involves the ownership and operation of selfstorage properties 

our current strategy is to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop only selfstorage properties consequently we are subject to risks inherent in investments in a single industry because investments in real estate are inherently illiquid this strategy makes it difficult for us to diversify our investment portfolio and to limit our risk when economic conditions change decreases in market rents negative tax real estate and zoning law changes and changes in environmental protection laws may also increase our costs lower the value of our investments and decrease our income which would adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties 

because real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in our portfolio in response to changing economic financial and investment conditions is limited the real estate market is affected by many factors such as general economic conditions availability of financing interest rates and other factors including supply and demand that are beyond our control we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property 

we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold we cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements in acquiring a property we may agree to transfer restrictions that materially restrict us from selling that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property these transfer restrictions would impede our ability to sell a property even if we deem it necessary or appropriate 

any investments in unimproved real property may take significantly longer to yield incomeproducing returns if at all and may result in additional costs to us to comply with rezoning restrictions or environmental regulations 

we have invested in the past and may invest in the future in unimproved real property unimproved properties generally take longer to yield incomeproducing returns based on the typical time required for development any development of unimproved property may also expose us to the risks and uncertainties associated with rezoning the land for a higher use or development and environmental concerns of governmental entities andor community groups any unsuccessful investments or delays in realizing an incomeproducing return or increased costs to develop unimproved real estate could restrict our ability to earn our targeted rate of return on an investment or adversely affect our ability to pay operating expenses which would harm our financial condition and operating results 

any negative perceptions of the selfstorage industry generally may result in a decline in our stock price 

to the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the selfstorage industry the value of our securities may be negatively impacted which could result in our securities trading below the inherent value of our assets 

risks related to our debt financings 

disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us 

the united states credit markets are experiencing significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing continued uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to refinance existing debt maturities on favorable terms or at all which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions and fund development projects a prolonged downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as 

prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing these events in the credit markets have also had an adverse effect on other financial markets in the united states which may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock preferred stock or other equity securities these disruptions in the financial markets may have other adverse effects on us or the economy generally which could cause our stock price to decline 

required payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our properties or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations 

as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 14 billion of outstanding indebtedness we may incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions and development we may borrow under our credit lines or borrow new funds to finance these future properties additionally we do not anticipate that our internally generated cash flow will be adequate to repay our existing indebtedness upon maturity and therefore we expect to repay our indebtedness through refinancings and equity andor debt offerings further we may need to borrow funds in order to make cash distributions to maintain our qualification as a reit or to make our expected distributions 

if we are required to utilize our credit lines for purposes other than acquisition activity this will reduce the amount available for acquisitions and could slow our growth therefore our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences including the following 

• our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments • we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms including to make acquisitions or to continue to make distributions required to maintain our qualification as a reit • we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness • because a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates an increase in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense • we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties possibly on disadvantageous terms • after debt service the amount available for cash distributions to our stockholders is reduced • our debt level could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt • we may experience increased vulnerability to economic and industry downturns reducing our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions • we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases • we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgages may enforce our guarantees • we may violate restrictive covenants in our loan documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations and • our default under any one of our mortgage loans with crossdefault or crosscollateralization provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness or result in the foreclosures of other properties 18 

we could become highly leveraged in the future because our organizational documents contain no limitation on the amount of debt we may incur 

our organizational documents contain no limitations on the amount of indebtedness that we or our operating partnership may incur we could alter the balance between our total outstanding indebtedness and the value of our portfolio at any time if we become more highly leveraged then the resulting increase in debt service could adversely affect our ability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness and to pay our anticipated cash distributions andor to continue to make cash distributions to maintain our reit qualification and could harm our financial condition 

increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and make cash distributions to our stockholders 

as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 14 billion of debt outstanding of which approximately 3041 million or 216 was subject to variable interest rates this variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 33 per annum increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase our interest expense which could harm our cash flow and our ability to pay cash distributions for example if market rates of interest on this variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 30 million annually 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations 

in certain cases we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements hedging involves risks such as the risk that the counterparty may fail to honor its obligations under an arrangement failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders 

risks related to qualification and operation as a reit 

to maintain our qualification as a reit we may be forced to borrow funds on a shortterm basis during unfavorable market conditions 

to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our net taxable income each year excluding net capital gains and we are subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income each year in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions made by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years while historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our shareholders a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances its own stock for distributions with respect to taxable years ending on or before december 31 2011 recent internal revenue service guidance allows us to satisfy up to 90 of the distribution requirements discussed above through the distribution of shares of our stock if certain conditions are met assuming we continue to satisfy these distributions requirements with cash we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis or possibly longterm to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these borrowing needs could result from a difference in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for us federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt amortization payments 

dividends payable by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates 

the maximum us federal income tax rate for dividends paid by domestic corporations to individual us stockholders is 15 through 2010 dividends paid by reits however are generally not eligible for the reduced rates the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause stockholders who are individuals to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits including our securities 

in addition the relative attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends which could negatively affect the value of our properties 

possible legislative or other actions affecting reits could adversely affect our stockholders 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us treasury department changes to tax laws which changes may have retroactive application could adversely affect our stockholders it cannot be predicted whether when in what forms or with what effective dates the tax laws applicable to us or our stockholders will be changed 

the power of our board of directors to revoke our reit election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders 

our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election without the approval of our stockholders if it determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a reit if we cease to qualify as a reit we would become subject to us federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our net taxable income to our stockholders which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholders 

our failure to qualify as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock 

we believe we operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit or lose our qualification as a reit at any time we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution for each of the years involved because 

• we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates • we also could be subject to the us federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes and • unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following a year during which we were disqualified in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits this means that our us individual stockholders would be taxed on our dividends at capital gains rates and our us corporate stockholders would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends subject in each case to applicable limitations under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and are able to avail ourselves of one or more of the relief 

provisions under the internal revenue code in order to maintain our reit status we may nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of 50000 or more for each such failure as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our securities 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the internal revenue code is greater in the case of a reit that like us holds its assets through a partnership the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the composition of our assets the sources of our gross income and the owners of our stock our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market value of our assets some of which are not susceptible to precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our net taxable income excluding capital gains and we will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income including capital gains in addition legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors our ability to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that is intended to allow us to qualify for taxation as a reit we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the internal revenue service regarding our qualification as a reit 

we will pay some taxes 

even though we qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we will be required to pay some us federal state and local taxes on our income and property extra space management inc manages selfstorage properties for our joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties we jointly with extra space management inc elected to treat extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary of our company for us federal income tax purposes a taxable reit subsidiary is a fully taxable corporation and may be limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to us in addition we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements among our tenants our taxable reit subsidiary and us are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties or if we receive payments for inventory or property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business also if we sell property as a dealer ie to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on any gain arising from such sales while we dont intend to sell properties as a dealer the irs could take a contrary position to the extent that we are or our taxable reit subsidiary is required to pay us federal state or local taxes we will have less cash available for distribution to stockholders 

complying with reit requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 

to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the nature and diversification of our assets the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock in order to meet these tests we may be required to forego attractive business or investment opportunities thus compliance with the reit requirements may adversely affect our ability to operate solely to maximize profits

 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2009 we owned or had ownership interests in 642 operating selfstorage properties of these properties 290 are whollyowned and 352 are held in joint ventures in addition we managed an additional 124 properties for franchisees or third parties bringing the total number of properties which we own andor manage to 766 these properties are located in 33 states and washington dc we receive a management fee equal to approximately 6 of gross revenues to manage the joint venture third party and franchise sites as of december 31 2009 we own andor manage approximately 55 million square feet of rentable space configured in approximately 500000 separate storage units approximately 70 of our properties are clustered around large population centers such as atlanta baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas houston las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san franciscooakland these markets contain aboveaverage population and income demographics for new selfstorage properties the clustering of assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale our acquisitions have given us an increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in many markets where we had no previous presence 

we consider a property to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization we consider a property to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 or has been open for three years 

as of december 31 2009 over 350000 tenants were leasing storage units at the 766 operating properties that we own andor manage primarily on a monthtomonth basis providing the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit although leases are shortterm in duration the typical tenant tends to remain at our properties for an extended period of time for properties that were stabilized as of december 31 2009 the median length of stay was approximately eleven months the average annual rent per square foot at these stabilized properties was 1346 at december 31 2009 compared to 1421 at december 31 2008 

our property portfolio is made up of different types of construction and building configurations depending on the site and the municipality where it is located most often sites are what we consider hybrid facilities a mix of both driveup buildings and multifloor buildings we have a number of multifloor buildings with elevator access only and a number of facilities featuring groundfloor access only 

the following table sets forth additional information regarding the occupancy of our stabilized properties on a statebystate basis as of december 31 2009 and 2008 the information as of december 31 2008 is on a pro forma basis as though all the properties owned at december 31 2009 were under our control as of december 31 2008

overview 

we are a fully integrated selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust or reit formed to continue the business commenced in 1977 by our predecessor companies to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop professionally managed selfstorage properties since 1996 our fully integrated development and acquisition teams have completed the development or acquisition of more than 725 selfstorage properties 

at december 31 2009 we owned had ownership interests in or managed 766 operating properties in 33 states and washington dc of these 766 operating properties 290 were whollyowned we held joint venture interests in 352 properties and our taxable reit subsidiary extra space management inc operated an additional 124 properties that are owned by franchisees or third parties in exchange for a management fee these operating properties contain approximately 55 million square feet of rentable space contained in approximately 500000 units and currently serve a customer base of over 350000 tenants 

our properties are generally situated in convenient highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as atlanta baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas houston las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san franciscooakland these areas all enjoy above average population growth and income levels the clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale we consider a property to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization a property is considered to be stabilized once it has achieved an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 or has been open for three years 

to maximize the performance of our properties we employ a stateoftheart webbased tracking and yield management technology called store developed by our management team store enables us to analyze set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions in addition we also have an industry leading revenue management system called revman we believe that the combination of stores yield management capabilities and the systematic processes developed by our team using revman allows us to more proactively manage revenues 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under existing leases at each of our selfstorage properties from management fees on the properties we manage for jointventure partners franchisees and unaffiliated third parties and from our tenant reinsurance program our management fee is equal to approximately 6 of total revenues generated by the managed properties 

we operate in competitive markets often where consumers have multiple selfstorage properties from which to choose competition has impacted and will continue to impact our property results we experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity our operating results depend materially on our 

ability to lease available selfstorage units to actively manage unit rental rates and on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments we believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the use of store and through the use of revman 

we continue to evaluate and implement a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to enable us to maximize stockholder value our strategies to maximize stockholder value include the following 

• maximize the performance of properties through strategic efficient and proactive management we pursue revenue generating and expense minimizing opportunities in our operations our revenue management team seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our technology systems ability to provide realtime interactive rental rate and discount management our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement national regional and local marketing programs which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost • expand our management business our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and expand our geographic footprint this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale in addition we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline we pursue strategic relationships with owners that strengthen our acquisition pipeline through agreements which give us first right of refusal to purchase the managed property in the event of a potential sale • acquire selfstorage properties from strategic partners and third parties our acquisitions team continues to selectively pursue the acquisition of single properties and multiproperty portfolios that we believe can provide stockholder value we believe we have established a reputation as a reliable ethical buyer which enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions in addition our status as an upreit enables flexibility when structuring deals during 2009 we acquired two whollyowned properties and completed the development of 12 properties all in our core markets of the completed development properties eight are whollyowned and consolidated and four are owned by us in joint ventures three of which are consolidated we have ten whollyowned development properties remaining that are scheduled for completion through 2010 and 2011 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those that impact our most critical accounting policies we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies 

consolidation arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as variable interest entities vies an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it is the primary beneficiary of the vie 

a vie is created when i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii the entitys equity holders as a group either a lack direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity through voting or similar rights b are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if 

they occur or c do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur if an entity is deemed to be a vie the enterprise that is deemed to absorb a majority of the expected losses or receive a majority of expected residual returns of the vie is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 

we have concluded that under certain circumstances when we 1 enter into option agreements for the purchase of land or facilities from an entity and pay a nonrefundable deposit or 2 enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures a vie may be created under condition i ii b or c of the previous paragraph for each vie created we have considered expected losses and residual returns based on the probability of future cash flows if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie the assets liabilities and operations of the vie are consolidated with our financial statements additionally our operating partnership has notes payable to three trusts that are vies under condition iia above since the operating partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts these vies are not consolidated 

real estate assets real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation direct and allowable internal costs associated with the development construction renovation and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized interest property taxes and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized 

expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives depreciation is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements which are generally between five and 39 years 

in connection with our acquisition of properties the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values which are estimated using significant unobservable inputs the value of the tangible assets consisting of land and buildings are determined as if vacant that is at replacement cost intangible assets which represent the value of existing tenant relationships are recorded at their fair values we measure the value of tenant relationships based on the amount of time required to replace existing customers which is based on our historical experience with turnover in our facilities debt assumed as part of an acquisition is recorded at fair value based on current interest rates compared to contractual rates acquisitionrelated transaction costs are expensed as incurred 

intangible lease rights include 1 purchase price amounts allocated to leases on two properties that cannot be classified as ground or building leases these rights are amortized to expense over the term of the leases and 2 intangibles related to ground leases on four properties where the ground leases were assumed by the company at rates that were different than the current market rates for similar leases the value associated with these assumed leases were recorded as intangibles which will be amortized over the lease terms 

evaluation of asset impairment we evaluate long lived assets held for use when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment we review each property at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist we focus on properties where occupancy andor rental income have decreased by a significant amount for these properties we determine whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the property will likely recover the lost occupancy andor revenue in the short term in addition we carefully review properties in the leaseup stage and compare actual operating results to original projections 

when we determine that an event that may indicate impairment has occurred we compare the carrying value of the related longlived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets an impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the assets exceeds 

the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the assets 

when real estate assets are identified as held for sale we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the fair value of the assets net of selling costs using significant unobservable inputs if the estimated fair values net of selling costs of the assets that have been identified for sale are less than the net carrying value of the assets then a valuation allowance is established the operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are generally presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

fair value of financial instruments the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents receivables other financial instruments included in other assets accounts payable and accrued expenses variable rate notes payable lines of credit and other liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2009 and 2008 approximate fair value the fair values of our notes receivable and our fixed rate notes payable are as follows 



investments in real estate ventures our investments in real estate joint ventures where we have significant influence but not control and joint ventures which are vies in which we are not the primary beneficiary are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

under the equity method our investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures for the purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows we follow the look through approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures under this approach distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital eg a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint ventures sale of assets in which case it is reported as an investing activity 

our management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired annually and when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment an investment is impaired if managements estimate of the fair value of the investment using significant unobservable inputs is less than its carrying value to the extent impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment 

derivative instruments and hedging activities the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk are considered fair value hedges derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges 

for derivatives designated as fair value hedges changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings for derivatives designated as cash 

flow hedges the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings 

conversion of operating partnership units conversions of operating partnership units to common stock when converted under the original provisions of the operating partnership agreement are accounted for by reclassifying the underlying net book value of the units from noncontrolling interest to our equity the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the adjustment to the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest is recognized as additional paid in capital of the company 

revenue and expense recognition rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants leases are generally on monthtomonth terms prepaid rents are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the leases promotional discounts are recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period late charges administrative fees merchandise sales and truck rentals are recognized in income when earned management and franchise fee revenues are recognized monthly as services are performed and in accordance with the terms of the related management agreements tenant reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenues over the period of insurance coverage equity in earnings of real estate entities is recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate entities interest income is recognized as earned 

property expenses including utilities property taxes repairs and maintenance and other costs to manage the facilities are recognized as incurred we accrue for property tax expense based upon invoice amounts estimates and historical trends if these estimates are incorrect the timing of expense recognition could be affected 

real estate sales in general sales of real estate and related profitslosses are recognized when all consideration has changed hands and risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred certain types of continuing involvement preclude sale treatment and related profit recognition other forms of continuing involvement allow for sale recognition but require deferral of profit recognition 

income taxes we have elected to be treated as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code in order to maintain our qualification as a reit among other things we are required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets as a reit we are not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to our stockholders we plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex if we were to fail to meet these requirements we would be subject to federal income tax we are subject to certain state and local taxes provision for such taxes has been included in property operating and general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 

we have elected to treat one of our corporate subsidiaries extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary trs in general our trs may perform additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or nonreal estate related business except for the operation or management of health care facilities or lodging facilities or the provision to any person under a franchise license or otherwise of rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated a trs is subject to corporate federal income tax deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense when incurred 

stockbased compensation the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards to employees and directors are based on estimated fair values awards are valued at fair value and recognized on a straight line basis over the service periods of each award

funds from operations 

ffo provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary along with net income and cash flows for an understanding of our operating results we believe ffo is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings net earnings assume that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses the values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and we believe ffo more accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts inc nareit as net income computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap excluding gains or losses on sales of operating properties plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis we believe that to further understand our performance ffo should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with gaap as presented in the consolidated financial statements 

the computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions the following table sets forth the calculation of ffo for the periods indicated dollars are in thousands except for share data

cash provided by financing activities were 91223 and 172685 for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively the decrease in cash provided in 2009 when compared to the prior year was primarily the result of proceeds from issuance of common stock of 276601 in 2008 compared to 0 in 2009 additionally we paid 56013 more cash in 2009 to repurchase a portion of our exchangeable senior notes when compared to the prior year these decreases were partially offset by a net increase of 206609 in the net proceeds from notes payable and lines of credit in 2009 when compared to 2008 and 46320 less cash paid for dividends in 2009 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2008 to the year ended december 31 2007 

cash flows provided by operating activities were 98391 and 102096 for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively this decrease was due mainly to an increase in the cash paid on behalf of affiliated joint ventures and related parties during 2008 compared to 2007 which resulted in an increase in receivables from related parties additionally more cash was spent to acquire other assets in 2008 when compared to 2007 these decreases were partially offset by the increase in cash due to the acquisition of new stabilized properties in 2008 and 2007 

cash used in investing activities was 224481 and 254344 for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively the decrease in 2008 was primarily the result of 56397 less cash being used to fund acquisition activities and the collection of 21812 of cash from the sale of our investments available for sale compared to a payment of 24460 to purchase investments available for sale in 2007 these decreases were partially offset by an increase of 19670 in development activities and an increase of 39223 invested in real estate ventures when compared to the prior year 

cash provided by financing activities was 172685 and 98824 for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively the increase in cash provided in 2008 was due primarily to proceeds from issuance of common stock of 276601 in 2008 compared to 0 in 2007 and no cash was loaned to the preferred op unit holder in 2008 when compared to the prior year these increases were offset primarily by the decrease of 250000 of proceeds from exchangeable senior notes as no new notes were issued in 2008 

2009 operational summary 

our 2009 property operations were challenging with decreases in samestore average annual occupancy revenues and net operating income on a samestore basis including tenant reinsurance revenues revenue and net operating income decreased 29 and 43 respectively samestore expense control was excellent with a yearonyear decrease of a 02 the decrease in samestore rental revenues was primarily due to decreased average annual occupancy and lower rates to new customers these decreases were partially offset by rental rate increases to existing tenants 

properties located in the markets of chicago indianapolis new york citynorthern new jersey san franciscosan jose and washington dc were the top performers when comparing year on year 

revenue markets performing below the portfolio average in yearonyear revenue included atlanta memphis miami philadelphia phoenix tampa and west palm beach 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2009 we had 131950 available in cash and cash equivalents we intend to use this cash to repay debt scheduled to mature in 2010 and 2011 and for general corporate purposes we are required to distribute at least 90 of our net taxable income excluding net capital gains to our stockholders on an annual basis to maintain our qualification as a reit recently issued guidance from the irs allowed for up to 90 of a reits dividends to be paid with its common stock through 2011 if certain conditions were met it is unlikely that we will have any substantial cash balances that could be used to meet our liquidity needs instead these needs must be met from cash generated from operations and external sources of capital 

our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts during 2009 we experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash or cash equivalents however there can be no assurance that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 

on february 13 2009 we entered into a 50000 secondary credit line that is collateralized by mortgages on certain real estate assets and matures february 13 2012 we intend to use the proceeds from the secondary credit line to repay debt and for general corporate purposes the secondary credit line has an interest rate of libor plus 325 basis points 35 at december 31 2009 as of december 31 2009 there were no amounts drawn on the secondary credit line we are subject to certain restrictive covenants relating to the secondary credit line we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of december 31 2009 

on october 19 2007 we entered into a 100000 credit line outstanding balances on the credit line at december 31 2009 and 2008 were 100000 and 27000 respectively we intend to use the proceeds of the credit line to repay debt and for general corporate purposes the credit line has an interest rate of between 100 and 205 basis points over libor depending on certain of our financial ratios 12 at december 31 2009 the credit line is collateralized by mortgages on certain real estate assets the credit line matures on october 31 2010 with two oneyear extensions available we are not subject to any financial covenants relating to the credit line 

as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 1406846 of debt resulting in a debt to total capitalization ratio of 571 as of december 31 2009 the ratio of total fixed rate debt and other instruments to total debt was 784 including 107145 on which we have interest rate swaps that have been included as fixedrate debt the weighted average interest rate of the total of fixed and variable rate debt at december 31 2009 was 51 certain of our real estate assets are pledged as collateral for our debt we are subject to certain restrictive covenants relating to our outstanding debt we were in compliance with all financial covenants at december 31 2009 

we expect to fund our shortterm liquidity requirements including operating expenses recurring capital expenditures dividends to stockholders distributions to holders of op units and interest on our outstanding indebtedness out of our operating cash flow cash on hand and borrowings under our credit lines in addition we are actively pursuing additional term loans secured by unencumbered properties 

our liquidity needs consist primarily of cash distributions to stockholders facility development and improvements property acquisitions principal payments under our borrowings and nonrecurring capital expenditures in addition we evaluate on an ongoing basis the merits of strategic acquisitions and other relationships which may require us to raise additional funds we do not expect that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs and instead expect to fund such needs 

out of additional borrowings of secured or unsecured indebtedness joint ventures with third parties and from the proceeds of public and private offerings of equity and debt additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all any additional issuance of equity or equitylinked securities may result in dilution to our stockholders in addition any new securities we issue could have rights preferences and privileges senior to holders of our common stock we may also use op units as currency to fund acquisitions from selfstorage owners who desire taxdeferral in their exiting transactions 

the us credit markets are experiencing significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing continued uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and fund current development projects in addition the financial condition of the lenders of our credit facilities may worsen to the point that they default on their obligations to make available to us the funds under those facilities a prolonged downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing these events in the credit markets have also had an adverse affect on other financial markets in the united states which may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock preferred stock or other equity securities these disruptions in the financial market may have other adverse effects on us or the economy generally which could cause our stock price to decline 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes further except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitments or intent to provide funding to any such entities accordingly we are not materially exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 

our exchangeable senior notes provide for excess exchange value to be paid in shares of our common stock if our stock price exceeds a certain amount see the notes to our financial statements for a further description of our exchangeable senior notes 

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth information on payments due by period at december 31 2009 



as of december 31 2009 the weighted average interest rate for all fixed rate loans was 56 and the weighted average interest rate on all variable rate loans was 33 

financing strategy 

we will continue to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts reviewed from time to time by our board of directors although our board of directors has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur we will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or variable rate in making financing decisions we will consider factors including but not limited to 

• the interest rate of the proposed financing • the extent to which the financing impacts flexibility in managing our properties • prepayment penalties and restrictions on refinancing • the purchase price of properties acquired with debt financing • longterm objectives with respect to the financing • target investment returns • the ability of particular properties and our company as a whole to generate cash flow sufficient to cover expected debt service payments • overall level of consolidated indebtedness • timing of debt and lease maturities • provisions that require recourse and crosscollateralization • corporate credit ratios including debt service coverage debt to total capitalization and debt to undepreciated assets and • the overall ratio of fixed and variable rate debt our indebtedness may be recourse nonrecourse or crosscollateralized if the indebtedness is nonrecourse the collateral will be limited to the particular properties to which the indebtedness relates in addition we may invest in properties subject to existing loans collateralized by mortgages or similar liens on our properties or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis we may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness to refinance investments 

including the redevelopment of existing properties for general working capital or to purchase additional interests in partnerships or joint ventures or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable 

during 2008 and 2009 we repurchased 162337 million in aggregate principal amount of our exchangeable senior notes on the open market for 119455 in cash we may from time to time seek to retire repurchase or redeem our additional outstanding debt including our exchangeable senior notes as well as shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases or redemptions if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

seasonality 

the selfstorage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations a greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from may through september historically our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of july while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early march results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our future income cash flows and fair values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary and tax policies domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2009 we had 14 billion in total debt of which 3041 million was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 30 million annually 

interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur further in the event of a change of that magnitude we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure

management

the remainder of our executive management team and their years of industry experience are as follows spencer f kirk president 8 years kent w christensen executive vice president and chief financial officer 11 years charles l allen executive vice president and chief legal officer 11 years and karl haas executive vice president and chief operating officer 21 years

our executive management and board of directors have a significant ownership position in the company with executive officers and directors owning approximately 7243647 shares or 844 of our outstanding common stock as of february 13 2009 

industry  competition 

selfstorage facilities refers to properties that offer doityourself monthtomonth storage space rental for personal or business use selfstorage offers a costeffective and flexible storage alternative tenants rent fully enclosed spaces that can vary in size according to their specific needs and to which they have unlimited exclusive access tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units selfstorage unit sizes typically range from five feet by five feet to 20 feet by 20 feet with an interior height of eight to 12 feet properties generally have onsite managers who supervise and run the daytoday operations providing tenants with assistance as needed 

selfstorage provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions due to life changes or simply because of a need for storage space the mix of residential tenants using a selfstorage property is determined by a propertys local demographics and often includes people who are looking to downsize their living space or others who are not yet settled into a permanent residence 

items that residential tenants place in selfstorage properties range from cars boats and recreational vehicles to furniture household items and appliances commercial tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods records inventory or storage for seasonal goods 

our research has shown that tenants choose a selfstorage property based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or business making highdensity hightraffic population centers ideal locations for selfstorage properties a propertys perceived security and the general professionalism of the site managers and staff are also contributing factors to a sites ability to successfully secure rentals although most selfstorage properties are leased to tenants on a monthtomonth basis tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time 

there are seasonal fluctuations in occupancy rates for selfstorage properties based on our experience generally there is increased leasing activity at selfstorage properties during the summer months due to the higher number of people who relocate during this period the highest level of occupancy is typically at the end of july while the lowest level of occupancy is seen in late february and early march 

since inception in the early 1970s the selfstorage industry has experienced significant growth in the past ten years there has been even greater growth according to the 2009 selfstorage almanac the almanac in 1998 there were only 27535 selfstorage properties in the united states with an average occupancy rate of 829 of net rentable square feet compared to 47514 selfstorage properties in 2008 with an average occupancy rate of 803 of net rentable square feet as population densities have increased in the united states there has been an increase in selfstorage awareness and corresponding development which we expect will continue in the future 

increased competition has affected our business and has led to both pricing and discount pressure this has limited our ability to increase revenues in many markets in which we operate many markets have been able to absorb the increase in selfstorage development due to superior demographics and density however select markets have not been able to absorb the new facilities and have not performed as well 

we have encountered competition when we have sought to acquire properties especially for brokered portfolios aggressive bidding practices have been commonplace between both public and private entities and this competition will likely continue to be a challenge for the companys growth strategy 

increased development within the selfstorage industry has also led to an increased emphasis on site location property design innovation and functionality we strive to have a creative and flexible approach to our development projects and we are open to a broad array of opportunities because of this flexibility this is especially true for new sites slated for highdensity population centers we can offer unique and attractive architecture to accommodate the requirements and tastes of local planning and zoning boards and to distinguish a facility from other offerings in the market due to the attractive architecture of many of our development properties we have been able to eliminate a typical barrier of entry for most selfstorage developers in areas usually reserved for more traditional retail and commercial users 

the industry is also characterized by fragmented ownership according to the 2009 almanac the top ten selfstorage companies in the united states owned approximately 103 of total us selfstorage properties and the top 50 selfstorage companies owned approximately 143 of the total us properties we believe this fragmentation will contribute to continued consolidation at some level in the future we also believe that we are well positioned to be able to compete for acquisitions given our historical reputation for closing deals 

we are the second largest selfstorage operator in the united states we are one of four public selfstorage reits along with public storage inc nyse psa sovran selfstorage inc nyse sss and ustoreit inc nyse ysi 

longterm growth and investment strategies 

our primary business objectives are to maximize cash flow available for distribution to our stockholders and to achieve sustainable longterm growth in cash flow per share in order to maximize longterm stockholder value we continue to evaluate a range of growth initiatives and opportunities including the following 

• maximize the performance of properties through strategic efficient and proactive management we plan to pursue revenue generating and expense minimizing opportunities in our operations our revenue management team will seek to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our technology systems ability to provide realtime interactive rental rate and discount management our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement national regional and local marketing programs which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost 6 

• expand our management business our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and expand our geographic footprint this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale in addition we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline we expect to pursue strategic relationships with owners that should strengthen our acquisition pipeline through agreements which give us first right of refusal to purchase the managed property in the event of a potential sale twentyone of the 50 acquisitions we completed in 2008 and 2007 came from this channel • acquire selfstorage properties from strategic partners and third parties our acquisitions team will continue to selectively pursue the acquisition of single properties and multiproperty portfolios that we believe can provide stockholder value we have sought to establish a reputation as a reliable ethical buyer which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions in addition our status as an upreit enables flexibility when structuring deals • develop new selfstorage properties we currently have joint venture and whollyowned development properties and may continue selectively to develop new selfstorage properties in our core markets our development pipeline through 2010 includes 26 projects financing of our longterm growth strategies 

• acquisition and development financing   we currently have a 1000 million revolving line of credit the credit line that is collateralized by certain of our selfstorage properties as of december 31 2008 the credit line had asset collateralizing capacity of 1000 million of which 270 million was drawn we expect to maintain a flexible approach in financing new property acquisitions we plan to finance future acquisitions and development through a combination of borrowings under the credit line traditional secured mortgage financing and additional equity offerings we drew an additional 500 million from the credit line on january 30 2009 

• joint venture financing   we own 334 of our stabilized properties and 14 of our leaseup properties through joint ventures with third parties including affiliates of prudential financial inc in each joint venture we generally manage the daytoday operations of the underlying properties and have the right to participate in major decisions relating to sales of properties or financings by the applicable joint venture our joint venture partners typically provide most of the equity capital required for the operation of the respective business under the operating agreements for the joint ventures we typically maintain the right to receive between 170 and 500 of the available cash flow from operations after our joint venture partners have received a predetermined return and between 170 and 500 of the available cash flow from capital transactions after our joint venture partners have received a return of their capital plus such predetermined return most joint venture agreements include buysell rights as well as rights of first refusal in connection with the sale of properties by the joint venture 

• disposition of properties   we will continue to review our portfolio for properties or groups of properties that are not strategically located and determine whether to sell these properties to fund other growth

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our securities involves various risks all investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information contained in this annual report before trading in our securities if any of the events set forth in the following risks actually occur our business operating results prospects and financial condition could be harmed 

our performance is subject to risks associated with real estate investments we are a real estate company that derives our income from operation of our properties there are a number of factors that may adversely affect the income that our properties generate including the following 

risks related to our properties and operations 

adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating results 

our operating results are dependent upon our ability to maximize occupancy levels and rental rates in our selfstorage properties adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we operate may lower our occupancy levels and limit our ability to increase rents or require us to offer rental discounts if our properties fail to generate revenues sufficient to meet our cash requirements including operating and other expenses debt service and capital expenditures our net income funds from operations ffo cash flow financial condition ability to make cash distributions to 

stockholders and the trading price of our securities could be adversely affected the following factors among others may adversely affect the operating performance of our properties 

• the national economic climate and the local or regional economic climate in the markets in which we operate which may be adversely impacted by among other factors industry slowdowns relocation of businesses and changing demographics • periods of economic slowdown or recession rising interest rates or declining demand for selfstorage or the public perception that any of these events may occur could result in a general decline in rental rates or an increase in tenant defaults • the continuation or worsening of the current economic environment • local or regional real estate market conditions such as the oversupply of selfstorage or a reduction in demand for selfstorage in a particular area • perceptions by prospective users of our selfstorage properties of the safety convenience and attractiveness of our properties and the neighborhoods in which they are located • increased operating costs including the need for capital improvements insurance premiums real estate taxes and utilities • changes in the supply of or demand for similar or competing properties in an area • the impact of environmental protection laws • earthquakes hurricanes and other natural disasters terrorist acts civil disturbances or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses and • changes in tax real estate and zoning laws recent us and international market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower growth through the third and fourth quarters of 2008 for the year ended december 31 2008 continued concerns about the systemic impact of inflation energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit and other macroeconomic factors have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the global economy and increased market uncertainty and instability continued turbulence in us and international markets may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the financial condition of our customers if these market conditions continue they may result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to promptly relet our units or if the rates upon such reletting are significantly lower than expected then our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

virtually all of our leases are on a monthtomonth basis any delay in reletting units as vacancies arise would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results in addition lower than expected rental rates upon reletting could adversely affect our revenues and impede our growth 

we depend upon our onsite personnel to maximize tenant satisfaction at each of our properties and any difficulties we encounter in hiring training and maintaining skilled field personnel may harm our operating performance 

we had 1615 field personnel as of february 13 2009 in the management and operation of our properties the general professionalism of our site managers and staff are contributing factors to a sites ability to successfully secure rentals and retain tenants we also rely upon our field personnel to maintain clean and secure selfstorage properties if we are unable to successfully recruit train and 

retain qualified field personnel the quality of service we strive to provide at our properties could be adversely affected which could lead to decreased occupancy levels and reduced operating performance 

other selfstorage operators may employ store or a technology similar to store which could enhance their ability to compete with us 

we rely on store a stateoftheart proprietary webbased tracking and yield management technology to support all aspects of our business operations and to help us implement new development and acquisition opportunities and strategies if other selfstorage companies obtain a license to use store or employ or develop a technology similar to store their ability to compete with us could be enhanced 

uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flow 

we maintain comprehensive liability fire flood earthquake wind as deemed necessary or as required by our lenders extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our properties with policy specifications limits and deductibles customarily carried for similar properties certain types of losses however may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable such as losses due to earthquakes hurricanes tornadoes riots acts of war or terrorism should an uninsured loss occur we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a property in addition if any such loss is insured we may be required to pay a significant deductible on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to our insurer being obligated to reimburse us for the loss or the amount of the loss may exceed our coverage for the loss as a result our operating results may be adversely affected 

increases in taxes and regulatory compliance costs may reduce our income 

costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws generally are not passed through to tenants directly and will affect us increases in income property or other taxes generally are not passed through to tenants under leases and may reduce our net income ffo cash flow financial condition ability to pay or refinance our debt obligations ability to make cash distributions to stockholders and the trading price of our securities similarly changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which could similarly adversely affect our business and results of operations 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our properties may affect our results of operations 

under various us federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations owners and operators of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigating and remediating certain hazardous substances or other regulated materials on or in such property such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such substances or materials the presence of such substances or materials or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owners or operators ability to lease sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances or other regulated materials may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials into the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with asbestoscontaining materials 

certain environmental laws also impose liability without regard to knowledge or fault for removal or remediation of hazardous substances or other regulated materials upon owners and operators of contaminated property even after they no longer own or operate the property moreover the past or present owner or operator from which a release emanates could be liable for any personal injuries or property damages that may result from such releases as well as any damages to natural resources that may arise from such releases 

certain environmental laws impose compliance obligations on owners and operators of real property with respect to the management of hazardous materials and other regulated substances for example environmental laws govern the management of asbestoscontaining materials and leadbased paint failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties or other sanctions 

no assurances can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner or operator of our properties did not create any material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our properties there also exists the risk that material environmental conditions liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future finally future laws ordinances or regulations and future interpretations of existing laws ordinances or regulations may impose additional material environmental liability 

costs associated with complying with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 may result in unanticipated expenses 

under the ada all places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these requirements became effective in 1992 a number of additional us federal state and local laws may also require modifications to our properties or restrict certain further renovations of the properties with respect to access thereto by disabled persons noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature which could result in substantial capital expenditures we have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine our compliance and we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with the ada or other legislation if one or more of our properties is not in compliance with the ada or other legislation then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the facility into compliance if we incur substantial costs to comply with the ada or other legislation our financial condition results of operations cash flow per share trading price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make cash distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected 

our investments in development and redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns which would harm our operating results and reduce the amount of funds available for distributions 

a component of our growth strategy is exploring new asset development and redevelopment opportunities through strategic joint ventures and on a whollyowned basis to the extent that we engage in these development and redevelopment activities they will be subject to the following risks normally associated with these projects 

• we may be unable to obtain financing for these projects on favorable terms or at all • we may not complete development projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts • we may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning land use building occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations and 11 

• occupancy rates and rents at newly developed or redeveloped properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors including market and economic conditions and may result in our investment not being profitable in deciding whether to develop or redevelop a particular property we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring the property up to the standards established for its intended market position or may be unable to increase occupancy at a newly acquired property as quickly as expected or at all any substantial unanticipated delays or expenses could adversely affect the investment returns from these development or redevelopment projects and harm our operating results liquidity and financial condition which could result in a decline in the value of our securities 

we may in the future develop selfstorage properties in geographic regions where we do not currently have a significant presence and where we do not possess the same level of familiarity with development which could adversely affect our ability to develop such properties successfully or at all or to achieve expected performance 

we rely on the investments of our joint venture partners for funding certain of our development and redevelopment projects if our reputation in the selfstorage industry changes or the number of investors considering us an attractive strategic partner is otherwise reduced our ability to develop or redevelop properties could be affected which would limit our growth 

we face competition for the acquisition of selfstorage properties and other assets which may impede our ability to make future acquisitions or may increase the cost of these acquisitions 

we compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of selfstorage properties and other assets including national regional and local operators and developers of selfstorage properties these competitors may drive up the price we must pay for selfstorage properties or other assets we seek to acquire or may succeed in acquiring those properties or assets themselves in addition our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive suitors because they may have greater resources may be willing to pay more or may have a more compatible operating philosophy in addition the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment properties may increase this competition would result in increased demand for these assets and therefore increased prices paid for them because of an increased interest in singleproperty acquisitions among taxmotivated individual purchasers we may pay higher prices if we purchase single properties in comparison with portfolio acquisitions if we pay higher prices for selfstorage properties or other assets our profitability will be reduced 

we may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria which may impede our growth 

our ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy we may not be successful in identifying suitable properties or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms or at all failure to identify or consummate acquisitions may slow our growth which could in turn adversely affect our stock price 

our ability to acquire properties on favorable terms and successfully integrate and operate them may be constrained by the following significant risks 

• competition from local investors and other real estate investors with significant capital including other publiclytraded reits and institutional investment funds 12 

• competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price which could reduce our profitability • the inability to achieve satisfactory completion of due diligence investigations and other customary closing conditions • failure to finance an acquisition on favorable terms or at all • we may spend more than the time and amounts budgeted to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties and • we may acquire properties subject to liabilities without any recourse or with only limited recourse with respect to unknown liabilities such as liabilities for cleanup of undisclosed environmental contamination claims by persons dealing with the former owners of the properties and claims for indemnification by general partners directors officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties in addition strategic decisions by us such as acquisitions may adversely affect the price of our securities 

we may not be successful in integrating and operating acquired properties 

we expect to make future acquisitions of selfstorage properties if we acquire any selfstorage properties we will be required to integrate them into our existing portfolio the acquired properties may turn out to be less compatible with our growth strategy than originally anticipated may cause disruptions in our operations or may divert managements attention away from daytoday operations which could impair our results of operations as a whole 

we do not always obtain independent appraisals of our properties and thus the consideration paid for these properties may exceed the value that may be indicated by thirdparty appraisals 

we do not always obtain thirdparty appraisals in connection with our acquisition of properties and the consideration being paid by us in exchange for those properties may exceed the value as determined by thirdparty appraisals in such cases the terms of any agreements and the valuation methods used to determine the value of the properties were determined by our senior management team 

risks related to our organization and structure 

our business could be harmed if key personnel with longstanding business relationships in the selfstorage industry terminate their employment with us 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of members of our executive management team our executive management team has substantial experience in the selfstorage industry in addition our ability to continue to develop properties depends on the significant relationships our executive management team has developed with our institutional joint venture partners such as affiliates of prudential financial inc there is no guarantee that any of them will remain employed by us we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers the loss of services of one or more members of our executive management team could harm our business and our prospects 

we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business without stockholder consent which may subject us to different risks 

we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business at any time without the consent of our stockholders which could result in our making investments and 

engaging in business activities that are different from and possibly riskier than the investments and businesses described in this document a change in our investment strategy or our entry into new lines of business may increase our exposure to other risks or real estate market fluctuations 

if other selfstorage companies convert to an upreit structure or if tax laws change we may no longer have an advantage in competing for potential acquisitions 

because we are structured as an upreit we are a more attractive acquirer of properties to taxmotivated sellers than our competitors that are not structured as upreits however if other selfstorage companies restructure their holdings to become upreits this competitive advantage will disappear in addition new legislation may be enacted or new interpretations of existing legislation may be issued by the internal revenue service irs or the us treasury department that could affect the attractiveness of our upreit structure so that it may no longer assist us in competing for acquisitions 

tax indemnification obligations may require the operating partnership to maintain certain debt levels 

in connection with the formation transactions entered into prior to our ipo in 2004 we agreed to make available to each of kenneth m woolley our chairman and chief executive officer richard s tanner our senior vice president development and other third parties the following tax protections for nine years with a threeyear extension if the applicable party continues to own at least 50 of the units in our operating partnership op units received by it in the formation transactions at the expiration of the initial nineyear period the opportunity to 1 guarantee debt or 2 enter into a special loss allocation and deficit restoration obligation in an aggregate amount with respect to the foregoing contributors of at least 600 million similar tax protections were provided to third party contributors in connection with property contributions to the operating partnership subsequent to the ipo we agreed to these provisions in order to assist these contributors in preserving their tax position after their contributions these obligations may require us to maintain certain indebtedness levels that we would not otherwise require for our business 

our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority 

as of december 31 2008 we held interests in 348 operating properties through joint ventures some of these arrangements could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority our reliance on coventurers financial conditions and disputes between us and our coventurers we expect to continue our joint venture strategy by entering into more joint ventures for the purpose of developing new selfstorage properties and acquiring existing properties in such event we would not be in a position to exercise sole decisionmaking authority regarding the property partnership joint venture or other entity the decisionmaking authority regarding the properties we currently hold through joint ventures is either vested exclusively with our joint venture partners is subject to a majority vote of the joint venture partners or equally shared by us and the joint venture partners in addition investments in partnerships joint ventures or other entities may under certain circumstances involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or coventurers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions partners or coventurers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions such as a sale because neither we nor the partner or coventurer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or coventurers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers andor directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or coventurers might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we 

may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our thirdparty partners or coventurers which could harm our financial condition 

kenneth m woolley our chairman and chief executive officer spencer f kirk president richard s tanner senior vice president development kent w christensen executive vice president and chief financial officer and charles l allen executive vice president and chief legal officer and other members of our senior management team have outside business interests which could divert their time and attention away from us which could harm our business 

kenneth m woolley our chairman and chief executive officer as well and certain other members of our senior management team have outside business interests these business interests include the ownership of a selfstorage property located in pico rivera california other than this property the members of our senior management are not currently engaged in any other selfstorage activities outside the company mr woolleys employment agreement requires that he devote substantially his full business time and attention to us however this agreement also permits him to devote time to his outside business interests these outside business interests could interfere with his ability to devote time to our business and affairs and as a result our business could be harmed 

conflicts of interest could arise as a result of our relationship with our operating partnership 

conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates and our operating partnership or any partner thereof our directors and officers have duties to our company under applicable maryland law in connection with their management of our company at the same time we through our whollyowned subsidiary have fiduciary duties as a general partner to our operating partnership and to the limited partners under delaware law in connection with the management of our operating partnership our duties through our whollyowned subsidiary as a general partner to our operating partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our company the partnership agreement of our operating partnership does not require us to resolve such conflicts in favor of either our company or the limited partners in our operating partnership unless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement delaware law generally requires a general partner of a delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith fairness and loyalty and which generally prohibit such general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest 

additionally the partnership agreement expressly limits our liability by providing that neither we our direct whollyowned massachusetts business trust subsidiary as the general partner of the operating partnership nor any of our or their trustees directors or officers will be liable or accountable in damages to our operating partnership the limited partners or assignees for errors in judgment mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if we or such trustee director or officer acted in good faith in addition our operating partnership is required to indemnify us our affiliates and each of our respective trustees officers directors employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against any and all losses claims damages liabilities whether joint or several expenses including without limitation attorneys fees and other legal fees and expenses judgments fines settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims demands actions suits or proceedings civil criminal administrative or investigative that relate to the operations of the operating partnership provided that our operating partnership will not indemnify for 1 willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law 2 any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement or 3 in the case of a criminal proceeding the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful 

the provisions of delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement 

we may pursue less vigorous enforcement of terms of contribution and other agreements because of conflicts of interest with certain of our officers 

kenneth m woolley our chairman and chief executive officer spencer f kirk president kent w christensen executive vice president and chief financial officer charles l allen executive vice president and chief legal officer and richard s tanner senior vice president development had direct or indirect ownership interests in certain properties that were contributed to our operating partnership in the formation transactions following the completion of the formation transactions we under the agreements relating to the contribution of such interests became entitled to indemnification and damages in the event of breaches of representations or warranties made by the contributors in addition kenneth m woolleys employment agreement includes an exception to his noncompetition covenant pursuant to which he is permitted to devote time to the management of other business interests none of these contribution and noncompetition agreements was negotiated at an armslength basis we may choose not to enforce or to enforce less vigorously our rights under these contribution and noncompetition agreements because of our desire to maintain our ongoing relationships with the individuals party to these agreements 

certain provisions of maryland law and our organizational documents including the stock ownership limit imposed by our charter may inhibit market activity in our stock and could prevent or delay a change in control transaction 

our charter subject to certain exceptions authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a reit and to limit any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding common stock or 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limit however our board of directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership limit to any proposed transferee whose ownership could jeopardize our qualification as a reit these restrictions on ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the ownership limit may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders different ownership limits apply to the family of kenneth m woolley certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and spencer f kirk certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and certain designated investment entities as defined in our charter 

our board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder approval in addition our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares our board of directors could issue additional shares of our common stock or establish a series of preferred stock that could have the 

effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise not be in the best interests of our stockholders 

our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited 

maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances in addition our charter eliminates our directors and officers liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law as a result we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law in addition we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers 

to the extent our distributions represent a return of capital for us federal income tax purposes our stockholders could recognize an increased capital gain upon a subsequent sale of common stock 

distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and not treated by us as a dividend will not be taxable to a us stockholder under current us federal income tax law to the extent those distributions do not exceed the stockholders adjusted tax basis in his her or its common stock but instead will constitute a return of capital and will reduce such adjusted basis if distributions result in a reduction of a stockholders adjusted basis in such holders common stock subsequent sales of such holders common stock will result in recognition of an increased capital gain or decreased capital loss due to the reduction in such adjusted basis 

risks related to the real estate industry 

our primary business involves the ownership operation and development of selfstorage properties 

our current strategy is to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop only selfstorage properties consequently we are subject to risks inherent in investments in a single industry because investments in real estate are inherently illiquid this strategy makes it difficult for us to diversify our investment portfolio and to limit our risk when economic conditions change decreases in market rents negative tax real estate and zoning law changes and changes in environmental protection laws may also increase our costs lower the value of our investments and decrease our income which would adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties 

because real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in our portfolio in response to changing economic financial and investment conditions is limited the real estate market is affected by many factors such as general economic conditions availability of financing interest rates and other factors including supply and demand that are beyond our control we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property 

we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold we cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or 

to make those improvements in acquiring a property we may agree to transfer restrictions that materially restrict us from selling that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property these transfer restrictions would impede our ability to sell a property even if we deem it necessary or appropriate 

any investments in unimproved real property may take significantly longer to yield incomeproducing returns if at all and may result in additional costs to us to comply with rezoning restrictions or environmental regulations 

we have invested in the past and may invest in the future in unimproved real property unimproved properties generally take longer to yield incomeproducing returns based on the typical time required for development any development of unimproved property may also expose us to the risks and uncertainties associated with rezoning the land for a higher use or development and environmental concerns of governmental entities andor community groups any unsuccessful investments or delays in realizing an incomeproducing return or increased costs to develop unimproved real estate could restrict our ability to earn our targeted rate of return on an investment or adversely affect our ability to pay operating expenses which would harm our financial condition and operating results 

any negative perceptions of the selfstorage industry generally may result in a decline in our stock price 

to the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the selfstorage industry the value of our securities may be negatively impacted which could result in our securities trading below the inherent value of our assets 

risks related to our debt financings 

disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us 

the united states credit markets are experiencing significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing continued uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to refinance existing debt maturities on favorable terms or at all which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions and fund current and future development projects a prolonged downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing these events in the credit markets have also had an adverse effect on other financial markets in the united states which may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock preferred stock or other equity securities these disruptions in the financial markets may have other adverse effects on us or the economy generally which could cause our stock price to decline 

required payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our properties or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations 

as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 13 billion of outstanding indebtedness we may incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions and development we may borrow under 

our credit line or borrow new funds to finance these future properties additionally we do not anticipate that our internally generated cash flow will be adequate to repay our existing indebtedness upon maturity and therefore we expect to repay our indebtedness through refinancings and equity andor debt offerings further we may need to borrow funds in order to make cash distributions to maintain our qualification as a reit or to make our expected distributions 

if we are required to utilize our credit line for purposes other than acquisition activity this will reduce the amount available for acquisitions and could slow our growth therefore our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences including the following 

• our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments • we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms including to make acquisitions or to continue to make distributions required to maintain our qualification as a reit • we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness • because a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates an increase in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense • we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties possibly on disadvantageous terms • after debt service the amount available for cash distributions to our stockholders is reduced • our debt level could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt • we may experience increased vulnerability to economic and industry downturns reducing our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions • we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases • we may violate restrictive covenants in our loan documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations and • our default under any one of our mortgage loans with crossdefault or crosscollateralization provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness or result in the foreclosures of other properties we could become highly leveraged in the future because our organizational documents contain no limitation on the amount of debt we may incur 

our organizational documents contain no limitations on the amount of indebtedness that we or our operating partnership may incur we could alter the balance between our total outstanding indebtedness and the value of our portfolio at any time if we become more highly leveraged then the resulting increase in debt service could adversely affect our ability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness and to pay our anticipated cash distributions andor to continue to make cash distributions to maintain our reit qualification and could harm our financial condition 

increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and make cash distributions to our stockholders 

as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 13 billion of debt outstanding of which approximately 1524 million or 117 was subject to variable interest rates including 618 million on which we had a reverse interest rate swap this variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 16 per annum increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase our interest expense which could harm our cash flow and our ability to pay cash distributions for example if market rates of interest on this variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 15 million annually 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations 

in certain cases we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements hedging involves risks such as the risk that the counterparty may fail to honor its obligations under an arrangement failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders 

risks related to qualification and operation as a reit 

to maintain our qualification as a reit we may be forced to borrow funds on a shortterm basis during unfavorable market conditions 

to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our net taxable income each year excluding net capital gains and we are subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income each year in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions made by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years while historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our shareholders a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances its own stock for distributions with respect to taxable years ending on or before december 31 2009 recent internal revenue service guidance allows us to satisfy up to 90 of the distribution requirements discussed above through the distribution of shares of our stock if certain conditions are met assuming we continue to satisfy these distributions requirements with cash we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis or possibly longterm to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these borrowing needs could result from a difference in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for us federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt amortization payments 

dividends payable by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates 

the maximum us federal income tax rate for dividends paid by domestic corporations to individual us stockholders is 15 through 2010 dividends paid by reits however are generally not eligible for the reduced rates the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause stockholders who are individuals to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits including our securities 

in addition the relative attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends which could negatively affect the value of our properties 

possible legislative or other actions affecting reits could adversely affect our stockholders 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us treasury department changes to tax laws which changes may have retroactive application could adversely affect our stockholders it cannot be predicted whether when in what forms or with what effective dates the tax laws applicable to us or our stockholders will be changed 

the power of our board of directors to revoke our reit election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders 

our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election without the approval of our stockholders if it determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a reit if we cease to qualify as a reit we would become subject to us federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our net taxable income to our stockholders which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholders 

our failure to qualify as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock 

we believe we operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit or lose our qualification as a reit at any time we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution for each of the years involved because 

• we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates • we also could be subject to the us federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes and • unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following a year during which we were disqualified in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits this means that our us individual stockholders would be taxed on our dividends at capital gains rates and our us corporate stockholders would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends subject in each case to applicable limitations under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and are able to avail ourselves of one or more of the relief provisions under the internal revenue code in order to maintain our reit status we may nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of 50000 or more for each such failure as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our securities 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the internal revenue code is greater in the case of a reit that like us holds its assets through a partnership the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the composition of our assets the sources of our gross income and the owners of our stock our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market value of our assets some of which are not susceptible to precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our net taxable income excluding capital gains and we will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income including capital gains in addition legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors our ability to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that is intended to allow us to qualify for taxation as a reit we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the internal revenue service regarding our qualification as a reit 

we will pay some taxes 

even though we qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we will be required to pay some us federal state and local taxes on our income and property extra space management inc manages selfstorage properties for our joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties we jointly with extra space management inc elected to treat extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary of our company for us federal income tax purposes a taxable reit subsidiary is a fully taxable corporation and may be limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to us in addition we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements among our tenants our taxable reit subsidiary and us are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties or if we receive payments for inventory or property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business also if we sell property as a dealer ie to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on any gain arising from such sales while we dont intend to sell properties as a dealer the irs could take a contrary position to the extent that we are or our taxable reit subsidiary is required to pay us federal state or local taxes we will have less cash available for distribution to stockholders 

complying with reit requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 

to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the nature and diversification of our assets the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock in order to meet these tests we may be required to forego attractive business or investment opportunities thus compliance with the reit requirements may adversely affect our ability to operate solely to maximize profits

 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2008 we owned or had ownership interests in 627 operating selfstorage properties of these properties 279 are whollyowned and 348 are held in joint ventures in addition we managed an additional 67 properties for franchisees or third parties bringing the total number of properties which we own andor manage to 694 these properties are located in 33 states and washington dc we receive a management fee equal to approximately 6 of gross revenues to manage the joint venture third party and franchise sites as of december 31 2008 we own and or manage approximately 50 million square feet of rentable space configured in approximately 475000 separate storage units approximately 70 of our properties are clustered around large population centers such as atlanta baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas houston las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san franciscooakland these markets contain aboveaverage population and income demographics for new selfstorage properties the clustering of assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale our acquisitions have given us an increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in many markets where we had no previous presence 

we consider a property to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization we consider a property to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 or has been open for three years 

as of december 31 2008 over 300000 tenants were leasing storage units at the 694 operating properties that we own andor manage primarily on a monthtomonth basis providing the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit although leases are shortterm in duration the typical tenant tends to remain at our properties for an extended period of time for properties that were stabilized as of december 31 2008 the median length of stay was approximately eleven months 

our property portfolio is made up of different types of construction and building configurations depending on the site and the municipality where it is located most often sites are what we consider hybrid facilities a mix of both driveup buildings and multifloor buildings we have a number of multifloor buildings with elevator access only and a number of facilities featuring groundfloor access only 

the following table sets forth additional information regarding the occupancy of our stabilized properties on a statebystate basis as of december 31 2008 and 2007 the information as of december 31 2007 is on a pro forma basis as though all the properties owned at december 31 2008 were under our control as of december 31 2007

overview 

we are a fully integrated selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust or reit formed to continue the business commenced in 1977 by our predecessor companies to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop professionally managed selfstorage properties since 1996 our fully integrated development and acquisition teams have completed the development or acquisition of more than 640 selfstorage properties 

at december 31 2008 we owned had an ownership interest in or managed 694 operating properties in 33 states and washington dc as of december 31 2008 279 of our operating properties were whollyowned we held joint venture interests in 348 operating properties and our taxable reit subsidiary extra space management inc operated an additional 67 properties that are owned by franchisees or third parties in exchange for a management fee these operating properties contain approximately 50 million square feet of rentable space contained in approximately 475000 units and currently serve a customer base of over 300000 tenants 

our properties are generally situated in convenient highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as atlanta baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas houston las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san franciscooakland these areas all enjoy above average population growth and income levels the clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale we consider a property to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization a property is considered to be stabilized once it has achieved an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 or has been open for three years 

to maximize the performance of our properties we employ a stateoftheart proprietary webbased tracking and yield management technology called store developed by our management team store enables us to analyze set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions in addition we also have an industry leading revenue management system called revman we believe that the combination of stores yield management capabilities and the systematic processes developed by our team using revman allows us to more proactively manage revenues 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under existing leases at each of our selfstorage properties from management fees on the properties we manage for jointventure partners franchisees and unaffiliated third parties and from our tenant reinsurance program our management fee is equal to approximately 6 of total revenues generated by the managed properties 

we operate in competitive markets often where consumers have multiple selfstorage properties from which to choose competition has impacted and will continue to impact our property results we experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity our operating results depend materially on our 

ability to lease available selfstorage units to actively manage unit rental rates and on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments we believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the use of store and through the use of revman 

we continue to evaluate and implement a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to enable us to maximize stockholder value our strategies to maximize stockholder value include the following 

• maximize the performance of properties through strategic efficient and proactive management we plan to pursue revenue generating and expense minimizing opportunities in our operations our revenue management team will seek to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our technology systems ability to provide realtime interactive rental rate and discount management our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement national regional and local marketing programs which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost • expand our management business our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and expand our geographic footprint this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale in addition we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline we expect to pursue strategic relationships with owners that should strengthen our acquisition pipeline through agreements which give us first right of refusal to purchase the managed property in the event of a potential sale twentyone of the 50 acquisitions we completed in 2008 and 2007 came from this channel • acquire selfstorage properties from strategic partners and third parties our acquisitions team will continue to selectively pursue the acquisition of single properties and multiproperty portfolios that we believe can provide stockholder value we have sought to establish a reputation as a reliable ethical buyer which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions in addition our status as an upreit enables flexibility when structuring deals • develop new selfstorage properties we currently have joint venture and whollyowned development properties and may continue selectively to develop new selfstorage properties in our core markets our development pipeline through 2010 includes 26 projects during 2008 we acquired 11 whollyowned properties and we completed the development of nine properties in our core markets of the completed development properties eight are whollyowned and one is owned by us in a joint venture joint venture properties provide us with a potential acquisition pipeline in the future fourteen development properties are scheduled for completion in 2009 11 of which are whollyowned and three of which will be owned by us in joint ventures 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those that impact our most critical accounting policies we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies 

consolidation we follow fasb interpretation no 46r  consolidation of variable interest entities  fin 46r which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities vies under 

fin 46r arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as vies an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it is the primary beneficiary of the vie 

under fin 46r a vie is created when i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii the entitys equity holders as a group either a lack direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity through voting or similar rights b are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur or c do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur if an entity is deemed to be a vie pursuant to fin 46r the enterprise that is deemed to absorb a majority of the expected losses or receive a majority of expected residual returns of the vie is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 

based on the provisions of fin 46r we have concluded that under certain circumstances when we 1 enter into option agreements for the purchase of land or facilities from an entity and pay a nonrefundable deposit or 2 enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures a vie may be created under condition i ii b or c of the previous paragraph for each vie created we have considered expected losses and residual returns based on the probability of future cash flows as outlined in fin 46r if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie the assets liabilities and operations of the vie are consolidated with our financial statements additionally our operating partnership has notes payable to three trusts that are vies under condition iia above since the operating partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts these vies are not consolidated 

real estate assets real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation direct and allowable internal costs associated with the development construction renovation and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized interest property taxes and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized 

expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives depreciation is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements which are generally between five and 39 years 

in connection with our acquisition of properties the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values the value of the tangible assets consisting of land and buildings are determined as if vacant that is at replacement cost intangible assets which represent the value of existing tenant relationships are recorded at their fair values we measure the value of tenant relationships based on our historical experience with turnover in our facilities we amortize to expense the tenant relationships on a straightline basis over the average period that a tenant is expected to utilize the facility currently estimated to be 18 months 

intangible lease rights include 1 purchase price amounts allocated to leases on two properties that cannot be classified as ground or building leases these rights are amortized to expense over the term of the leases and 2 intangibles related to ground leases on four properties that were acquired in 2007 these ground leases were assumed by the company at rates that were lower than the current market rates for similar leases the value associated with these assumed leases were recorded as intangibles which will be amortized over the lease terms 

evaluation of asset impairment we evaluate longlived assets which are held for use for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment if such events occur we compare the carrying value of these longlived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets an impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the asset the 

impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the asset 

when real estate assets are identified by management as held for sale we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the fair value net of selling costs if the estimated fair value net of selling costs of the assets that have been identified for sale are less than the net carrying value of the assets then a valuation allowance is established the operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

investments available for sale we account for our investments in debt and equity securities according to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 115  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  which requires securities classified as available for sale to be stated at fair value adjustments to the fair value of available for sale securities are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income a decline in the fair value of investment securities below cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in a reduction in the carrying amount to fair value the impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established we classified our investments in auction rate securities as investments available for sale in the accompanying balance sheet these investments were carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive deficit unrealized losses that were otherthantemporary were recognized in earnings we had no investments available for sale as of december 31 2008 

fair value of financial instruments the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents receivables other financial instruments included in other assets accounts payable and accrued expenses variable rate notes payable line of credit and other liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2008 and 2007 approximate fair value the fair value of the note receivable to the preferred op unit holder at december 31 2008 and 2007 was 124024 and 108915 respectively the carrying value of the note receivable to the preferred op unit holder at december 31 2008 and 2007 was 100000 and 100000 respectively the aggregate fair value of fixed rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts at december 31 2008 and 2007 was 1062949 and 968519 respectively the carrying value of these fixed rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts at december 31 2008 and 2007 was 937756 and 944916 respectively the fair value of our exchangeable senior notes at december 31 2008 and 2007 was 131039 and 286947 respectively the carrying value of the exchangeable senior notes at december 31 2008 and 2007 was 209663 and 250000 respectively 

investments in real estate ventures our investments in real estate joint ventures where we have significant influence but not control and joint ventures which are vies in which we are not the primary beneficiary are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

under the equity method our investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures for the purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows we follow the look through approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures under this approach distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital eg a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint ventures sale of assets in which case it is reported as an investing activity 

our management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired when events or circumstances indicate that there 

may be an impairment an investment is impaired if managements estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value to the extent impairment has occurred and it is considered to be other than temporary the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment 

derivative instruments and hedging activities statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 133  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk are considered fair value hedges derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges 

for derivatives designated as fair value hedges changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings 

conversion of operating partnership units conversions of operating partnership units to common stock when converted under the original provisions of the agreement are accounted for by reclassifying the underlying net book value of the units from minority interest to equity in accordance with eitf no 957  implementation issues related to the treatment of minority interest in certain real estate investment trusts  

revenue and expense recognition rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants leases are generally on monthtomonth terms prepaid rents are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the leases promotional discounts are recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period late charges administrative fees merchandise sales and truck rentals are recognized in income when earned management and franchise fee revenues are recognized monthly as services are performed and in accordance with the terms of the management agreements tenant reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenues over the period of insurance coverage equity in earnings of real estate entities is recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate entities interest income is recognized as earned 

property expenses including utilities property taxes repairs and maintenance and other costs to manage the facilities are recognized as incurred we accrue for property tax expense based upon estimates and historical trends if these estimates are incorrect the timing of expense recognition could be affected 

real estate sales we evaluate real estate sales for both sale recognition and profit recognition in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 66  accounting for sales of real estate  in general sales of real estate and related profitslosses are recognized when all consideration has changed hands and risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred certain types of continuing involvement preclude sale treatment and related profit recognition other forms of continuing involvement allow for sale recognition but require deferral of profit recognition 

income taxes we have elected to be treated as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code in order to maintain our qualification as a reit among other things we are required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets as a reit we are not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income which meets certain criteria and is distributed 

annually to our stockholders we plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex if we were to fail to meet these requirements we would be subject to federal income tax we are subject to certain state and local taxes provision for such taxes has been included in property operating and general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 

we have elected to treat one of our corporate subsidiaries extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary trs in general our trs may perform additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or nonreal estate related business except for the operation or management of health care facilities or lodging facilities or the provision to any person under a franchise license or otherwise of rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated a trs is subject to corporate federal income tax the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 109  accounting for income taxes fas 109 under fas 109 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 

we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 48  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 48 an interpretation of fas 109 on january 1 2007 as a result of the implementation of fin 48 we recognized no material adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits at the adoption date of january 1 2007 there were no material unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2008 and 2007 there were also no material unrecognized tax benefits 

interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense when incurred as of december 31 2008 and 2007 the company had no interest or penalties related to uncertain tax provisions 

stockbased compensation effective january 1 2006 we adopted sfas no 123 revised 2004  sharebased payment  sfas 123r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values sfas 123r supersedes sfas no 123  accounting for stockbased compensation  and accounting principles board opinion no 25  accounting for stock issued to employees  apb 25 we adopted sfas 123r using the modified prospective application method of adoption which requires us to record compensation cost related to nonvested stock awards as of december 31 2005 by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair value of these awards over their remaining service period with no change in historical reported earnings awards granted after december 31 2005 are valued at fair value in accordance with provisions of sfas 123r and recognized on a straight line basis over the service periods of each award 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 157 fair value measurements fas 157 fas 157 defines fair value establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements fas 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and does not require any new fair value measurements fas 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years in february 2008 the fasb issued fasb statement of position no 1572 effective date of fasb statement no 157 the fsp the fsp amends fas 157 to delay the effective date for fas 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis for items within that scope the fsp defers the effective date of fas 157 to fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years we adopted fas 157 effective january 1 2008 except as it relates to nonfinancial assets and liabilities

funds from operations 

ffo provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary along with net income and cash flows for an understanding of our operating results we believe ffo is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings because net earnings assumes that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses we believe that the values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and ffo more accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts inc nareit as net income computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap excluding gains or losses on sales of operating properties plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis we believe that to further understand our performance ffo should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with gaap as presented in the consolidated financial statements 

the computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity or as an indicator of our ability to make cash 

distributions the following table sets forth the calculation of ffo dollars are in thousands except for share data

cash flows provided by operating activities were 96664 and 101332 for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively this decrease was due mainly to an increase in the cash paid on behalf of affiliated joint ventures and related parties during 2008 compared to 2007 which resulted in an increase in receivables from related parties additionally more cash was spent to acquire other assets in 2008 when compared to 2007 these decreases were partially offset by the increase in cash due to the acquisition of new stabilized properties in 2008 and 2007

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 63972 available in cash and cash equivalents we intend to use this cash to repay debt scheduled to mature in 2009 and for general corporate purposes we are required to distribute at least 90 of our net taxable income excluding net capital gains to our stockholders on an annual basis to maintain our qualification as a reit recently issued guidance from the irs allows for up to 90 of a reits dividends to be paid with its common stock in 2009 if certain conditions are met we will continue to review our dividend payment policy on a quarterly basis and may consider a reduction in our dividend distribution andor payment of our dividend distribution using a combination of cash and our common stock it is unlikely that we will 

have any substantial cash balances that could be used to meet our liquidity needs instead these needs must be met from cash generated from operations and external sources of capital 

our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts during 2008 we experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash or cash equivalents however there can be no assurance that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 

on october 19 2007 we entered into a 100000 credit line we intend to use the proceeds of the credit line to repay debt scheduled to mature in 2009 and for general corporate purposes the credit line has an interest rate of between 100 and 205 basis points over libor depending on certain of our financial ratios the credit line is collateralized by mortgages on certain real estate assets the credit line matures on october 31 2010 with two oneyear extensions available outstanding balances on the credit line at december 31 2008 and 2007 were 27000 and 0 respectively 

on october 4 2004 we entered into a reverse interest rate swap the swap agreement with us bank national association relating to our existing 618 million fixed rate mortgage with wachovia bank which is due in 2009 pursuant to the swap agreement we will receive fixed interest payments of 43 and pay variable interest payments based on the onemonth libor plus 07 on a notional amount of 618 million there were no origination fees or other up front costs incurred by us in connection with the swap agreement 

as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 1299851 of debt resulting in a debt to total capitalization ratio of 580 as of december 31 2008 the ratio of total fixed rate debt and other instruments to total debt was 883 61770 on which we have a reverse interest rate swap has been included as variable rate debt the weighted average interest rate of the total of fixed and variable rate debt at december 31 2008 was 47 

certain of our real estate assets are pledged as collateral for our debt we are subject to certain restrictive covenants relating to our outstanding debt we were in compliance with all covenants at december 31 2008 

we expect to fund our shortterm liquidity requirements including operating expenses recurring capital expenditures dividends to stockholders distributions to holders of op units and interest on our outstanding indebtedness out of our operating cash flow cash on hand and borrowings under our credit line in addition the company is actively pursuing additional term loans secured by unencumbered properties 

our liquidity needs consist primarily of cash distributions to stockholders new facility development property acquisitions principal payments under our borrowings and nonrecurring capital expenditures in addition we evaluate on an ongoing basis the merits of strategic acquisitions and other relationships which may require us to raise additional funds we do not expect that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs and instead expect to fund such needs out of additional borrowings of secured or unsecured indebtedness joint ventures with third parties and from the proceeds of public and private offerings of equity and debt in addition we will continue to review our dividend payment policy on a quarterly basis and may consider a reduction in our dividend distribution andor payment of our dividend distribution using our common stock additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all any additional issuance of equity or equitylinked securities may result in dilution to our stockholders in addition any new securities we issue could have rights preferences and privileges senior to holders of our common stock we may also use op units as currency to fund acquisitions from selfstorage owners who desire taxdeferral in their exiting transactions 

the us credit markets are experiencing significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing continued uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and fund current and future development projects in addition the financial condition of the lenders of our credit facilities may worsen to the point that they default on their obligations to make available to us the funds under those facilities a prolonged downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing these events in the credit markets have also had an adverse affect on other financial markets in the united states which may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock preferred stock or other equity securities these disruptions in the financial market may have other adverse effects on us or the economy generally which could cause our stock price to decline

except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes further except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitments or intent to provide funding to any such entities accordingly we are not materially exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 

our exchangeable senior notes provide for excess exchange value to be paid in shares of our common stock if our stock price exceeds a certain amount see the notes to our financial statements for a further description of our exchangeable senior notes

financing strategy 

we will continue to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts reviewed from time to time by our board of directors although our board of directors has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur we will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or variable rate in making financing decisions we will consider factors including but not limited to 

• the interest rate of the proposed financing • the extent to which the financing impacts flexibility in managing our properties • prepayment penalties and restrictions on refinancing • the purchase price of properties acquired with debt financing • longterm objectives with respect to the financing • target investment returns • the ability of particular properties and our company as a whole to generate cash flow sufficient to cover expected debt service payments • overall level of consolidated indebtedness • timing of debt and lease maturities • provisions that require recourse and crosscollateralization • corporate credit ratios including debt service coverage debt to total capitalization and debt to undepreciated assets and • the overall ratio of fixed and variable rate debt our indebtedness may be recourse nonrecourse or crosscollateralized if the indebtedness is nonrecourse the collateral will be limited to the particular properties to which the indebtedness relates in addition we may invest in properties subject to existing loans collateralized by mortgages or similar liens on our properties or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis we may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness to refinance investments including the redevelopment of existing properties for general working capital or to purchase additional interests in partnerships or joint ventures or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable 

during october 2008 we repurchased 40337 million in aggregate principal amount of our exchangeable senior notes on the open market for 31721 in cash we may from time to time seek to retire repurchase or redeem our additional outstanding debt including our exchangeable senior notes as well as shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases or redemptions if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

seasonality 

the selfstorage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations a greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from may through september historically our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of july while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early march results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our future income cash flows and fair values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary and tax policies domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 13 billion in total debt of which approximately 1524 million was subject to variable interest rates including the approximately 618 million on which we have the reverse interest rate swap if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 15 million annually 

interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur further in the event of a change of that magnitude we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure 

the aggregate fair value of fixed rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts at december 31 2008 was 11 billion the carrying value of these fixed rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts at december 31 2008 was 9378 million the fair value of the exchangeable senior notes at december 31 2008 was 1310 million the carrying value of the exchangeable senior notes at december 31 2008 was 2097 million

management 

members of our executive management team have significant experience in all aspects of the selfstorage industry and have an average of more than fourteen years of industry experience the senior management team has collectively acquired andor developed more than 700 properties during the past 25 years for the company the predecessor and other entities kenneth m woolley chairman and chief executive officer and richard s tanner senior vice president development have worked in the selfstorage industry since 1977 and led some of the earliest selfstorage facility development projects in the united states

our executive management and board of directors have a significant ownership position in the company with executive officers and directors owning 6107401 shares or 92 of our outstanding common stock as of february 15 2008 

industry  competition 

selfstorage facilities refers to properties that offer doityourself monthtomonth storage space rental for personal or business use selfstorage offers a costeffective and flexible storage alternative tenants rent fully enclosed spaces that can vary in size according to their specific needs and to which they have unlimited exclusive access tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units selfstorage unit sizes typically range from five feet by five feet to 20 feet by 20 feet with an interior height of eight to 12 feet properties generally have onsite managers who supervise and run the daytoday operations providing tenants with assistance as needed 

selfstorage provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions due to lifechanges or simply because of a need for storage space the mix of residential tenants using a selfstorage property is determined by a propertys local demographics and often includes people who are looking to downsize their living space or others who are not yet settled into a permanent residence 

items that residential tenants place in selfstorage properties range from cars boats and recreational vehicles to furniture household items and appliances commercial tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods records extra inventory or storage for seasonal goods 

our research has shown that tenants choose a selfstorage property based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or business making highdensity hightraffic population centers ideal locations for a selfstorage property a propertys perceived security and the general professionalism of the site managers and staff are also contributing factors to a sites ability to successfully secure rentals although most selfstorage properties are leased to tenants on a monthtomonth basis tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time 

there are seasonal fluctuations in occupancy rates for selfstorage properties based on our experience generally there is increased leasing activity at selfstorage properties during the summer months due to the higher number of people who relocate during this period the highest level of occupancy is typically at the end of july while the lowest level of occupancy is seen in late february and early march 

since inception in the early 1970s the selfstorage industry has experienced significant growth in the past ten years there has been even greater growth according to the 2008 selfstorage almanac the almanac in 1997 there were only 25180 selfstorage properties in the united states with an average occupancy rate of 885 of net rentable square feet compared to 44974 selfstorage properties in 2007 with an average occupancy rate of 814 of net rentable square feet as population densities have increased in the united states there has been an increase in selfstorage awareness and corresponding development which we expect will continue in the future 

increased competition has affected our business and has led to both pricing and discount pressure this has limited our ability to increase revenues in many markets in which we operate many markets have been able to absorb the increase in selfstorage development due to superior demographics and density however select markets have not been able to absorb the new facilities and have not performed as well 

we have encountered competition when we have sought to acquire properties especially for brokered portfolios aggressive bidding practices have been commonplace between both public and private entities and this competition will continue to be a challenge for the companys growth strategy 

increased development within the selfstorage industry has also led to an increased emphasis on site location property design innovation and functionality we strive to have a creative and flexible approach to our development projects and we are open to a broad array of opportunities because of this flexibility this is especially true for new sites slated for highdensity population centers we can offer unique and attractive architecture to accommodate the requirements and tastes of local planning and zoning boards and to distinguish a facility from other offerings in the market due to the attractive architecture of many of our development properties we have been able to eliminate a typical barrier of entry for most selfstorage developers in areas usually reserved for more traditional retail and commercial users 

the industry is also characterized by fragmented ownership according to the 2008 almanac the top ten selfstorage companies in the united states owned approximately 116 of total us selfstorage properties and the top 50 selfstorage companies owned approximately 153 of the total us properties we believe this fragmentation will contribute to continued consolidation at some level in the future we also believe that we are well positioned to be able to compete for acquisitions given our enhanced ability to access capital as a public company and our historical reputation for closing deals 

after our acquisition of the storage usa properties on july 14 2005 we became the second largest selfstorage operator in the united states we are now one of four public selfstorage reits along with public storage inc nyse psa sovran selfstorage inc nyse sss and ustoreit inc nyse ysi 

growth and investment strategies 

our primary business objectives are to maximize cash flow available for distribution to our stockholders and to achieve sustainable longterm growth in cash flow per share in order to maximize longterm stockholder value we continue to evaluate a range of growth initiatives and opportunities including the following 

• maximize the performance of properties through strategic efficient and proactive management we plan to pursue revenue generating and expense minimizing opportunities in our operations our revenue management team will seek to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our technology systems ability to provide realtime interactive rental rate and discount management our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement national regional and local marketing programs which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost • focus on the acquisition of selfstorage properties from strategic partners and third parties our acquisitions team will continue to pursue the acquisition of single properties and multiproperty portfolios that we believe can provide stockholder value our july 2005 acquisition of storage usa has bolstered our reputation as a reliable ethical buyer which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close nonbrokered private deals in addition our status as an upreit enables flexibility when structuring deals 6 

• develop new selfstorage properties we currently have joint venture and whollyowned development properties and will continue to develop new selfstorage properties in our core markets our development pipeline through 2009 includes 26 projects the majority of the projects will be developed on a whollyowned basis by the company • expand our management business we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline we expect to pursue strategic relationships with owners that should strengthen our acquisition pipeline through agreements which give us first right of refusal to purchase the managed property in the event of a potential sale nineteen of our 39 2007 acquisitions came from this channel financing of our growth strategies 

• acquisition and development financing   we currently have a 1000 million revolving line of credit the credit line that is collateralized by certain of our selfstorage properties as of december 31 2007 the credit line had 1000 million of available capacity based on the assets collateralizing the credit line we expect to maintain a flexible approach in financing new property acquisitions we plan to finance future acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under the credit line traditional secured mortgage financing additional equity offerings and additional joint venture partnerships 

• development joint venture financing   we own 326 of our 591 stabilized properties and 20 of our 60 leaseup properties through joint ventures with third parties including affiliates of prudential financial inc in each joint venture we generally manage the daytoday operations of the underlying properties and have the right to participate in major decisions relating to sales of properties or financings by the applicable joint venture our joint venture partners typically provide most of the equity capital required for the operation of the respective business under the operating agreements for the joint ventures we typically maintain the right to receive between 170 and 500 of the available cash flow from operations after our joint venture partners have received a predetermined return and between 170 and 500 of the available cash flow from capital transactions after our joint venture partners have received a return of their capital plus such predetermined return most joint venture agreements include buysell rights as well as rights of first refusal in connection with the sale of properties by the joint venture 

• disposition of properties   we will continue to review our portfolio for properties or groups of properties that are not strategically located and determine whether to dispose of these properties to fund other growth 

regulation 

generally selfstorage properties are subject to various laws ordinances and regulations including regulations relating to lien sale rights and procedures changes in any of these laws or regulations as well as changes in laws such as the comprehensive environmental response and compensation liability act cercla which increase the potential liability for environmental conditions or circumstances existing or created by tenants or others on properties or laws affecting development construction operation upkeep safety and taxation may result in significant unanticipated expenditures loss of selfstorage sites or other impairments to operations which would adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

under the americans with disabilities act of 1990 the ada all places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled 

persons these requirements became effective in 1992 a number of additional us federal state and local laws also exist that may require modifications to the properties or restrict further renovations thereof with respect to access thereto by disabled persons noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature thereby requiring substantial capital expenditures to the extent our properties are not in compliance we are likely to incur additional costs to comply with the ada 

insurance activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state in accordance with the mccarranferguson act and are subject to the grammleachbliley act and the privacy regulations promulgated by the federal trade commission pursuant thereto 

property management activities are often subject to state real estate brokerage laws and regulations as determined by the particular real estate commission for each state 

changes in any of the laws governing our conduct could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business or could materially affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

employees 

as of february 15 2008 we had 1853 employees and believe our relationship with our employees to be good our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement 




 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our securities involves various risks all investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information contained in this annual report before trading in our securities if any of the events set forth in the following risks actually occur our business operating results prospects and financial condition could be harmed 

our performance is subject to risks associated with real estate investments we are a real estate company that derives our income from operation of our properties there are a number of factors that may adversely affect the income that our properties generate including the following 

risks related to our properties and operations 

if we are unable to promptly relet our units or if the rates upon such reletting are significantly lower than expected then our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

virtually all of our leases are on a monthtomonth basis any delay in reletting units as vacancies arise would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results in addition lower than expected rental rates upon reletting could impede our growth 

we face increasing competition for the acquisition of selfstorage properties and other assets which may impede our ability to make future acquisitions or may increase the cost of these acquisitions 

we compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of selfstorage properties and other assets including national regional and local operators and developers of selfstorage properties these competitors may drive up the price we must pay for selfstorage properties or other assets we seek to acquire or may succeed in acquiring those properties or assets themselves in addition our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive suitors because they may have greater resources may be willing to pay more or may have a more compatible operating philosophy in addition the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment properties may increase this competition will result in increased 

demand for these assets and therefore increased prices paid for them because of an increased interest in singleproperty acquisitions among taxmotivated individual purchasers we may pay higher prices if we purchase single properties in comparison with portfolio acquisitions if we pay higher prices for selfstorage properties or other assets our profitability will be reduced 

our investments in development and redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns which would harm our operating results and reduce the amount of funds available for distributions 

a key component of our growth strategy is exploring new asset development and redevelopment opportunities through strategic joint ventures and on a whollyowned basis to the extent that we engage in these development and redevelopment activities they will be subject to the following risks normally associated with these projects 

• we may be unable to obtain financing for these projects on favorable terms or at all • we may not complete development projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts • we may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning land use building occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations and • occupancy rates and rents at newly developed or redeveloped properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors including market and economic conditions and may result in our investment not being profitable in deciding whether to develop or redevelop a particular property we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring the property up to the standards established for its intended market position or may be unable to increase occupancy at a newly acquired property as quickly as expected or at all any substantial unanticipated delays or expenses could adversely affect the investment returns from these development or redevelopment projects and harm our operating results liquidity and financial condition which could result in a decline in the value of our securities 

we may in the future develop selfstorage properties in geographic regions where we do not currently have a significant presence and where we do not possess the same level of familiarity with development which could adversely affect our ability to develop such properties successfully or at all or to achieve expected performance 

we rely on the investments of our joint venture partners for funding our development and redevelopment projects if our reputation in the selfstorage industry changes or the number of investors considering us an attractive strategic partner is otherwise reduced our ability to develop or redevelop properties could be affected which would limit our growth 

we may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria which may impede our growth and negatively affect our stock price 

our ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy we may not be successful in identifying suitable properties or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms or at all failure to identify or consummate acquisitions will slow our growth which could in turn adversely affect our stock price 

our ability to acquire properties on favorable terms and successfully integrate and operate them may be constrained by the following significant risks 

• competition from local investors and other real estate investors with significant capital including other publiclytraded reits and institutional investment funds • competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price which could reduce our profitability • the inability to achieve satisfactory completion of due diligence investigations and other customary closing conditions • failure to finance an acquisition on favorable terms or at all • we may spend more than the time and amounts budgeted to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties and • we may acquire properties subject to unknown liabilities without any recourse or with only limited recourse such as liabilities for cleanup of undisclosed environmental contamination claims by persons dealing with the former owners of the properties and claims for indemnification by general partners directors officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties in addition strategic decisions by us such as acquisitions may adversely affect the price of our securities 

we may not be successful in integrating and operating acquired properties 

we expect to make future acquisitions of selfstorage properties if we acquire any selfstorage properties we will be required to integrate them into our existing portfolio the acquired properties may turn out to be less compatible with our growth strategy than originally anticipated may cause disruptions in our operations or may divert managements attention away from daytoday operations which could impair our results of operations as a whole 

we depend upon our onsite personnel to maximize tenant satisfaction at each of our properties and any difficulties we encounter in hiring training and maintaining skilled field personnel may harm our operating performance 

we had 1578 field personnel as of february 15 2008 in the management and operation of our properties the general professionalism of our site managers and staff are contributing factors to a sites ability to successfully secure rentals and retain tenants we also rely upon our field personnel to maintain clean and secure selfstorage properties if we are unable to successfully recruit train and retain qualified field personnel the quality of service we strive to provide at our properties could be adversely affected which could lead to decreased occupancy levels and reduced operating performance 

other selfstorage operators may employ store or a technology similar to store which could enhance their ability to compete with us 

we rely on store a stateoftheart proprietary webbased tracking and yield management technology to support all aspects of our business operations and to help us implement new development and acquisition opportunities and strategies if other selfstorage companies obtain a license to use store or employ or develop a technology similar to store their ability to compete with us could be enhanced 

uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flow 

we maintain comprehensive liability fire flood earthquake wind as deemed necessary or as required by our lenders extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our properties with policy specifications limits and deductibles customarily carried for similar properties certain types of losses however may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable such as losses due to earthquakes hurricanes tornadoes riots acts of war or terrorism should an uninsured loss occur we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a property in addition if any such loss is insured we may be required to pay a significant deductible on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to our insurer being obligated to reimburse us for the loss or the amount of the loss may exceed our coverage for the loss as a result our operating results may be adversely affected 

increases in taxes and regulatory compliance costs may reduce our income 

costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws generally are not passed through to tenants directly and will affect us increases in income property or other taxes generally are not passed through to tenants under leases and may reduce our net income funds from operations ffo cash flow financial condition ability to pay or refinance our debt obligations ability to make distributions to stockholders and the trading price of our securities similarly changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which could similarly adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we do not always obtain independent appraisals of our properties and thus the consideration paid for these properties may exceed the value that may be indicated by thirdparty appraisals 

we do not always obtain thirdparty appraisals in connection with our acquisition of properties and the consideration being paid by us in exchange for those properties may exceed the value as determined by thirdparty appraisals in such cases the terms of any agreements and the valuation methods used to determine the value of the properties were determined by our senior management team 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our properties may affect our results of operations 

under various us federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations owners and operators of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigating and remediating certain hazardous substances or other regulated materials on or in such property such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such substances or materials the presence of such substances or materials or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owners or operators ability to lease sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances or other regulated materials may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials into the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with asbestoscontaining materials 

certain environmental laws also impose liability without regard to knowledge or fault for removal or remediation of hazardous substances or other regulated materials upon owners and operators of contaminated property even after they no longer own or operate the property moreover the past or present owner or operator from which a release emanates could be liable for any personal injuries or 

property damages that may result from such releases as well as any damages to natural resources that may arise from such releases 

certain environmental laws impose compliance obligations on owners and operators of real property with respect to the management of hazardous materials and other regulated substances for example environmental laws govern the management of asbestoscontaining materials and leadbased paint failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties or other sanctions 

no assurances can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner or operator of our properties did not create any material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our properties there also exists the risk that material environmental conditions liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future finally future laws ordinances or regulations and future interpretations of existing laws ordinances or regulations may impose additional material environmental liability 

our investments availableforsale portfolio is invested in auction rate securities or ars failures in these auctions affect our liquidity while deterioration in credit ratings of issuers andor third parties insuring such investments may require us to adjust the carrying value of our investment through an impairment charge to earnings 

at december 31 2007 we had 245 million par value invested in auction rate securities if an auction fails for amounts we have invested in ars our investment will not be liquid at december 31 2007 auctions for all of our ars had failed as a result we will not be able to access such funds until a future auction on these investments is successful or these securities are redeemed we cannot assure you that an auction with respect to these securities will ever succeed or that these securities will be redeemed in which case we would be required to hold the ars until maturity these investments are non mortgagebacked and are insured for their principal and interest in the case of default related to these failed auctions we recorded a 12 million otherthantemporary impairment charge and a 14 million temporary impairment charge to reduce the value of our investment in ars to an estimated fair value of approximately 218 million to the extent that the auctions continue to fail andor the credit rating of the issuers or the third parties insuring such investments deteriorates we may be required to record further impairment charges with respect to these securities 

adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating results 

our operating results are dependent upon our ability to maximize occupancy levels and rental rates in our selfstorage properties adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we operate may lower our occupancy levels and limit our ability to increase rents or require us to offer rental discounts if our properties fail to generate revenues sufficient to meet our cash requirements including operating and other expenses debt service and capital expenditures our net income ffo cash flow financial condition ability to make distributions to stockholders and the trading price of our securities could be adversely affected the following factors among others may adversely affect the operating performance of our properties 

• the national economic climate and the local or regional economic climate in the markets in which we operate which may be adversely impacted by among other factors industry slowdowns relocation of businesses and changing demographics • periods of economic slowdown or recession rising interest rates or declining demand for selfstorage or the public perception that any of these events may occur could result in a general decline in rental rates or an increase in tenant defaults 12 

• local or regional real estate market conditions such as the oversupply of selfstorage or a reduction in demand for selfstorage in a particular area • perceptions by prospective users of our selfstorage properties of the safety convenience and attractiveness of our properties and the neighborhoods in which they are located • increased operating costs including the need for capital improvements insurance premiums real estate taxes and utilities • changes in the supply of or demand for similar or competing properties in an area • the impact of environmental protection laws • earthquakes hurricanes and other natural disasters terrorist acts civil disturbances or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses and • changes in tax real estate and zoning laws risks related to our organization and structure 

our business could be harmed if key personnel with longstanding business relationships in the selfstorage industry terminate their employment with us 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our chairman and chief executive officer and the other members of our executive management team our executive management team has substantial experience in the selfstorage industry in addition our ability to continue to develop properties depends on the significant relationships our executive management team has developed with our institutional joint venture partners such as affiliates of prudential financial inc there is no guarantee that any of them will remain employed by us we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers the loss of services of one or more members of our executive management team particularly our chairman and chief executive officer could harm our business and our prospects 

we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business without stockholder consent which may subject us to different risks 

we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business at any time without the consent of our stockholders which could result in our making investments and engaging in business activities that are different from and possibly riskier than the investments and businesses described in this document a change in our investment strategy or our entry into new lines of business may increase our exposure to other risks or real estate market fluctuations 

if other selfstorage companies convert to an upreit structure or if tax laws change we may no longer have an advantage in competing for potential acquisitions 

because we are structured as an upreit we are a more attractive acquirer of properties to taxmotivated sellers than our competitors that are not structured as upreits however if other selfstorage companies restructure their holdings to become upreits this competitive advantage will disappear in addition new legislation may be enacted or new interpretations of existing legislation may be issued by the internal revenue service irs or the us treasury department that could affect the attractiveness of our upreit structure so that it may no longer assist us in competing for acquisitions 

tax indemnification obligations may require the operating partnership to maintain certain debt levels 

in connection with the formation transactions entered into prior to our ipo in 2004 and certain other property acquisitions we agreed to make available to each of kenneth m woolley our chairman and chief executive officer richard s tanner our senior vice president development and other third parties the following tax protections for nine years with a threeyear extension if the applicable party continues to own at least 50 of the op units received by it in the formation transactions at the expiration of the initial nineyear period the opportunity to 1 guarantee debt or 2 enter into a special loss allocation and deficit restoration obligation in an aggregate amount with respect to the foregoing contributors of at least 600 million we agreed to these provisions in order to assist these contributors in preserving their tax position after their contributions these obligations may require us to maintain certain indebtedness that we would not otherwise require for our business 

our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority 

as of december 31 2007 we held interests in 346 properties through joint ventures all of these arrangements could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority our reliance on coventurers financial conditions and disputes between us and our coventurers we expect to continue our joint venture strategy by entering into more joint ventures for the purpose of developing new selfstorage properties and acquiring existing properties in such event we would not be in a position to exercise sole decisionmaking authority regarding the property partnership joint venture or other entity the decisionmaking authority regarding the properties we currently hold through joint ventures is either vested exclusively with our joint venture partners is subject to a majority vote of the joint venture partners or equally shared by us and the joint venture partners in addition investments in partnerships joint ventures or other entities may under certain circumstances involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or coventurers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions partners or coventurers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions such as a sale because neither we nor the partner or coventurer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or coventurers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers andor directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or coventurers might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our thirdparty partners or coventurers which could harm our financial condition 

kenneth m woolley our chairman and chief executive officer spencer f kirk president richard s tanner senior vice president development kent w christensen executive vice president and chief financial officer and charles l allen executive vice president and chief legal officer members of our senior management team have outside business interests which could divert their time and attention away from us which could harm our business 

kenneth m woolley our chairman and chief executive officer as well and certain other members of our senior management team have outside business interests these business interests include the ownership of a selfstorage property located in pico rivera california other than this property the members of our senior management are not currently engaged in any other selfstorage activities outside the company in addition mr woolleys employment agreement includes an exception to his noncompetition covenant pursuant to which he is permitted to devote a portion of his time to the management and operations of nevada west development llc formerly known as rmi development llc a multifamily business in which he has a majority ownership although mr woolleys employment agreement requires that he devote substantially his full business time and attention to us this agreement also permits him to devote time to his outside business interests these outside business interests could interfere with his ability to devote time to our business and affairs and as a result our business could be harmed 

conflicts of interest could arise as a result of our relationship with our operating partnership 

conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates and our operating partnership or any partner thereof our directors and officers have duties to our company under applicable maryland law in connection with their management of our company at the same time we through our whollyowned subsidiary have fiduciary duties as a general partner to our operating partnership and to the limited partners under delaware law in connection with the management of our operating partnership our duties through our whollyowned subsidiary as a general partner to our operating partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our company the partnership agreement of our operating partnership does not require us to resolve such conflicts in favor of either our company or the limited partners in our operating partnership unless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement delaware law generally requires a general partner of a delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith fairness and loyalty and which generally prohibit such general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest 

additionally the partnership agreement expressly limits our liability by providing that neither we our direct whollyowned massachusetts business trust subsidiary as the general partner of the operating partnership nor any of our or their trustees directors or officers will be liable or accountable in damages to our operating partnership the limited partners or assignees for errors in judgment mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if we or such trustee director or officer acted in good faith in addition our operating partnership is required to indemnify us our affiliates and each of our respective trustees officers directors employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against any and all losses claims damages liabilities whether joint or several expenses including without limitation attorneys fees and other legal fees and expenses judgments fines settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims demands actions suits or proceedings civil criminal administrative or investigative that relate to the operations of the operating partnership provided that our operating partnership will not indemnify for 1 willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law 2 any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement or 3 in the case of a criminal proceeding the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful 

the provisions of delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement 

our managements ownership of contingent conversion shares or ccss and contingent conversion units or ccus may cause them to devote a disproportionate amount of time to the performance of the related 14 whollyowned leaseup properties which could cause our overall operating performance to suffer 

in connection with our ipo we issued to certain contributors which included certain members of our senior management ccss andor a combination of op units and ccus the terms of the ccss and ccus provide that they will convert into our common stock and op units respectively only if the relevant 14 leaseup properties identified at the time of the ipo achieve specified performance thresholds prior to december 31 2008 as a result our directors and officers who own ccss and ccus may have an incentive to devote a disproportionately large amount of their time and attention to these properties in comparison with our remaining properties which could harm our overall operating results 

we may pursue less vigorous enforcement of terms of contribution and other agreements because of conflicts of interest with certain of our officers 

kenneth m woolley our chairman and chief executive officer spencer f kirk president kent w christensen executive vice president and chief financial officer charles l allen executive vice president and chief legal officer and richard s tanner senior vice president development had direct or indirect ownership interests in certain properties that were contributed to our operating partnership in the formation transactions following the completion of the formation transactions we under the agreements relating to the contribution of such interests became entitled to indemnification and damages in the event of breaches of representations or warranties made by the contributors in addition kenneth m woolleys employment agreement includes an exception to his noncompetition covenant pursuant to which he is permitted to devote time to the management and operations of nevada west development llc formerly known as rmi development llc a multifamily business none of these contribution and noncompetition agreements was negotiated at an armslength basis we may choose not to enforce or to enforce less vigorously our rights under these contribution and noncompetition agreements because of our desire to maintain our ongoing relationships with the individuals party to these agreements 

certain provisions of maryland law and our organizational documents including the stock ownership limit imposed by our charter may inhibit market activity in our stock and could prevent or delay a change in control transaction 

our charter subject to certain exceptions authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a reit and to limit any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding common stock or 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limit however our board of directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership limit to any proposed transferee whose ownership could jeopardize our qualification as a reit these restrictions on ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the ownership limit may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders different ownership limits apply to the family of kenneth m woolley certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and spencer f kirk certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and certain designated investment entities as defined in our charter 

our board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder approval in addition our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares our board of directors could issue additional shares of our common stock or establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise not be in the best interests of our stockholders 

our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited 

maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances in addition our charter eliminates our directors and officers liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law as a result we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law in addition we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers 

to the extent our distributions represent a return of capital for us federal income tax purposes our stockholders could recognize an increased capital gain upon a subsequent sale of common stock 

distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and not treated by us as a dividend will not be taxable to a us stockholder under current us federal income tax law to the extent those distributions do not exceed the stockholders adjusted tax basis in his her or its common stock but instead will constitute a return of capital and will reduce such adjusted basis if distributions result in a reduction of a stockholders adjusted basis in such holders common stock subsequent sales of such holders common stock will result in recognition of an increased capital gain or decreased capital loss due to the reduction in such adjusted basis 

risks related to the real estate industry 

our primary business involves the ownership operation and development of selfstorage properties 

our current strategy is to own operate and develop only selfstorage properties consequently we are subject to risks inherent in investments in a single industry because investments in real estate are inherently illiquid this strategy makes it difficult for us to diversify our investment portfolio and to limit our risk when economic conditions change decreases in market rents negative tax real estate and zoning law changes and changes in environmental protection laws may also increase our costs lower the value of our investments and decrease our income which would adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

any negative perceptions of the selfstorage industry generally may result in a decline in our stock price 

to the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the selfstorage industry the value of our securities may be negatively impacted which could result in our securities trading below the inherent value of our assets 

costs associated with complying with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 may result in unanticipated expenses 

under the ada all places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these requirements became effective in 1992 a number of additional us federal state and local laws may also require modifications to our properties or restrict certain further renovations of the properties with respect to access thereto by disabled persons noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature 

which could result in substantial capital expenditures we have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine our compliance and we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with the ada or other legislation if one or more of our properties is not in compliance with the ada or other legislation then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the facility into compliance if we incur substantial costs to comply with the ada or other legislation our financial condition results of operations cash flow per share trading price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected 

illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties 

because real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in our portfolio in response to changing economic financial and investment conditions is limited the real estate market is affected by many factors such as general economic conditions availability of financing interest rates and other factors including supply and demand that are beyond our control we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property 

we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold we cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements in acquiring a property we may agree to transfer restrictions that materially restrict us from selling that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property these transfer restrictions would impede our ability to sell a property even if we deem it necessary or appropriate 

any investments in unimproved real property may take significantly longer to yield incomeproducing returns if at all and may result in additional costs to us to comply with rezoning restrictions or environmental regulations 

we have invested in the past and may invest in the future in unimproved real property unimproved properties generally take longer to yield incomeproducing returns based on the typical time required for development any development of unimproved property may also expose us to the risks and uncertainties associated with rezoning the land for a higher use or development and environmental concerns of governmental entities andor community groups any unsuccessful investments or delays in realizing an incomeproducing return or increased costs to develop unimproved real estate could restrict our ability to earn our targeted rate of return on an investment or adversely affect our ability to pay operating expenses which would harm our financial condition and operating results 

risks related to our debt financings 

required payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our properties or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations 

as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 13 billion of outstanding indebtedness we expect to incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions we may borrow under our credit line or borrow new funds to acquire these future properties additionally we do not anticipate that our internally generated cash flow will be adequate to repay our existing indebtedness upon maturity and therefore we expect to repay our indebtedness through refinancings and equity andor debt offerings 

further we may need to borrow funds to make distributions required to maintain our qualification as a reit or to meet our expected distributions 

if we are required to utilize our credit line for purposes other than acquisition activity this will reduce the amount available for acquisitions and could slow our growth therefore our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences including the following 

• our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments • we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms including to make acquisitions or distributions required to maintain our qualification as a reit • we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness • because a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates an increase in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense • we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties possibly on disadvantageous terms • after debt service the amount available for distributions to our stockholders is reduced • our debt level could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt • we may experience increased vulnerability to economic and industry downturns reducing our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions • we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases • we may violate restrictive covenants in our loan documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations and • our default under any one of our mortgage loans with crossdefault or crosscollateralization provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness or result in the foreclosures of other properties we could become highly leveraged in the future because our organizational documents contain no limitation on the amount of debt we may incur 

our organizational documents contain no limitations on the amount of indebtedness that we or our operating partnership may incur we could alter the balance between our total outstanding indebtedness and the value of our portfolio at any time if we become more highly leveraged then the resulting increase in debt service could adversely affect our ability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness and to pay our anticipated distributions andor the distributions required to maintain our reit qualification and could harm our financial condition 

increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and make distributions to our stockholders 

as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 13 billion of debt outstanding of which approximately 1249 million or 95 was subject to variable interest rates including 618 million on which we had a reverse interest rate swap this variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 59 per annum increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase our interest expense which could harm our cash flow and our ability to pay distributions for example 

if market rates of interest on this variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 12 million annually 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations 

in certain cases we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements hedging involves risks such as the risk that the counterparty may fail to honor its obligations under an arrangement failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

recent disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on favorable terms or at all and have other adverse effects on us 

the united states credit markets have recently experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing continued uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to refinance existing debt maturities on favorable terms or at all which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions and fund current and future development projects a prolonged downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing these events in the credit markets have also had an adverse effect on other financial markets in the united states which may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock preferred stock or other equity securities these disruptions in the financial markets may have other adverse effects on us or the economy generally 

risks related to qualification and operation as a reit 

to maintain our qualification as a reit we may be forced to borrow funds on a shortterm basis during unfavorable market conditions 

to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our net taxable income each year excluding net capital gains and we are subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income each year in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions made by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years in order to maintain our reit qualification and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis or possibly longterm to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these borrowing needs could result from a difference in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for us federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt amortization payments 

dividends payable by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates 

the maximum us federal income tax rate for dividends paid by domestic corporations to individual us stockholders is 15 through 2010 dividends paid by reits however are generally 

not eligible for the reduced rates the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause stockholders who are individuals to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits including our securities 

in addition the relative attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends which could negatively affect the value of our properties 

possible legislative or other actions affecting reits could adversely affect our stockholders 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us treasury department changes to tax laws which changes may have retroactive application could adversely affect our stockholders it cannot be predicted whether when in what forms or with what effective dates the tax laws applicable to us or our stockholders will be changed 

the power of our board of directors to revoke our reit election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders 

our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election without the approval of our stockholders if it determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a reit if we cease to qualify as a reit we would become subject to us federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute our net taxable income to our stockholders which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholders 

our failure to qualify as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock 

we believe we operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit or lose our qualification as a reit at any time we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution for each of the years involved because 

• we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates • we also could be subject to the us federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes and • unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following a year during which we were disqualified in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits this means that our us individual stockholders would be taxed on our dividends at capital gains rates and our us corporate stockholders would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends subject in each case to applicable limitations under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and are able to avail ourselves of one or more of the relief provisions under the internal revenue code in order to maintain our reit status we may nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of 50000 or more for each such failure as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our securities 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the internal revenue code is greater in the case of a reit that like us holds its assets through a partnership the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the composition of our assets the sources of our gross income and the owners of our stock our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market value of our assets some of which are not susceptible to precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our net taxable income excluding capital gains and we will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income including capital gains in addition legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors our ability to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that is intended to allow us to qualify for taxation as a reit we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the internal revenue service regarding our qualification as a reit 

we will pay some taxes 

even though we qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we will be required to pay some us federal state and local taxes on our income and property extra space management inc manages selfstorage properties for our joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties we jointly with extra space management inc elected to treat extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary of our company for us federal income tax purposes a taxable reit subsidiary is a fully taxable corporation and may be limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to us in addition we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements among our tenants our taxable reit subsidiary and us are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties or if we receive payments for inventory or property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business also if we sell property as a dealer ie to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on any gain arising from such sales while we dont intend to sell properties as a dealer the irs could take a contrary position to the extent that we are or our taxable reit subsidiary is required to pay us federal state or local taxes we will have less cash available for distribution to stockholders 

complying with reit requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 

to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the nature and diversification of our assets the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock in order to meet these tests we may be required to forego attractive business or investment opportunities thus compliance with the reit requirements may adversely affect our ability to operate solely to maximize profits

 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2007 we owned or had ownership interests in 606 selfstorage properties located in 33 states and washington dc of these properties 260 are whollyowned and 346 are held in joint ventures in addition we managed an additional 45 properties for franchisees or third parties bringing the total number of properties which we own andor manage to 651 we receive a management fee equal to approximately 6 of gross revenues to manage the joint venture third party and franchise sites as of december 31 2007 we owned or had ownership interest in approximately 44 million square feet of space configured in approximately 420000 separate storage units approximately 70 of our properties are clustered around the larger population centers such as atlanta baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas houston las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san francisco these markets contain aboveaverage population and income demographics for new selfstorage properties the clustering of assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale the storage usa acquisition in 2005 gave us an increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in many markets where we had no previous presence 

we consider a property to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization we consider a property to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 or has been open for three years 

as of december 31 2007 approximately 300000 tenants were leasing storage units at the 651 properties that we own andor manage primarily on a monthtomonth basis providing the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit although leases are shortterm in duration the typical tenant tends to remain at our properties for an extended period of time for properties that were stabilized as of december 31 2007 the median length of stay was approximately eleven months 

our property portfolio is made up of different types of construction and building configurations depending on the site and the municipality where it is located most often sites are what we consider hybrid facilities a mix of both driveup buildings and multifloor buildings we have a number of multifloor buildings with elevator access only and a number of facilities featuring groundfloor access only 

the following table sets forth additional information regarding the occupancy of our stabilized properties on a statebystate basis as of december 31 2007 and 2006 the information as of december 31 2006 is on a pro forma basis as though all the properties owned at december 31 2007 were under our control as of december 31 2006

overview 

we are a fully integrated selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust or reit formed to continue the business commenced in 1977 by our predecessor companies to own operate acquire develop and redevelop professionally managed selfstorage properties since 1996 our fully integrated development and acquisition teams have completed the development or acquisition of more than 625 selfstorage properties 

in july 2005 we along with jointventure partner prudential real estate investors prei acquired storage usa susa from ge commercial finance for approximately 23 billion in cash the transaction made us the second largest operator of selfstorage facilities in the united states at december 31 2007 we owned or managed 651 properties in 33 states and washington dc as of december 31 2007 260 of our properties were whollyowned we held joint venture interests in 346 properties and our taxable reit subsidiary extra space management inc operated an additional 45 properties that are owned by franchisees or third parties in exchange for a management fee the properties that we own or in which we hold an ownership interest contain approximately 44 million square feet of rentable space contained in approximately 420000 units and currently serve a customer base of approximately 300000 tenants 

our properties are generally situated in convenient highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as atlanta baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas houston las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san francisco these areas all enjoy above average population growth and income levels the clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale we consider a property to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization a property is considered to be stabilized once it has achieved an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 or has been open for three years 

the susa acquisition gave us a national platform upon which to leverage operational advertising and other economic efficiencies the acquisition also created a builtin acquisition pipeline through various jointventure franchise and thirdparty management partners from which we have grown and can continue to grow in the future we also retained several key executives from the susa organization as well as the majority of its field operations team 

to maximize the performance of our properties we employ a stateoftheart proprietary webbased tracking and yield management technology called store developed by our management team store enables us to analyze set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions as part of the susa acquisition we gained access to susas industry leading revenue management team revman which managed susas rental rate and discount strategies we believe that the combination of stores yield management capabilities and the systematic processes developed by revman has allowed us to more proactively manage revenues 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under existing leases at each of our selfstorage properties from management fees on the properties we manage for jointventure partners franchisees and unaffiliated third parties and from our tenant insurance program our management fee is equal to approximately 6 of total revenues generated by the managed properties 

we operate in competitive markets often where consumers have multiple selfstorage properties from which to choose competition has impacted and will continue to impact our property results we experience minor seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity our operating results depend materially on our ability to lease available selfstorage units to actively manage unit rental rates and on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments we believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the use of store and through the use of the processes developed by revman 

we continue to evaluate and implement a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to enable us to maximize stockholder value our strategies to maximize stockholder value include the following 

• maximize the performance of properties through strategic efficient and proactive management we plan to pursue revenue generating and expense minimizing opportunities in our operations our revenue management team will seek to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through stores ability to provide realtime interactive rental rate and discount management our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement national regional and local marketing programs which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost • focus on the acquisition of selfstorage properties from strategic partners and third parties our acquisitions team will continue to pursue the acquisition of single properties and multiproperty portfolios that we believe can provide stockholder value our july 2005 acquisition of storage usa has bolstered our reputation as a reliable ethical buyer which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close nonbrokered private deals in addition our status as an upreit enables flexibility when structuring deals • develop new selfstorage properties we currently have several joint venture and whollyowned development properties and will continue to develop new selfstorage properties in our core markets our development pipeline through 2009 includes 26 projects the majority of the projects will be developed on a whollyowned basis by the company • expand our management business we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline we expect to pursue strategic relationships with owners that should strengthen our acquisition pipeline through agreements which give us first right of refusal to purchase the managed property in the event of a potential sale nineteen of our 39 2007 acquisitions came from this channel during 2007 we acquired 38 whollyowned properties and a minority equity interest in one additional consolidated property we completed the development of six properties in our core markets of the properties completed three are whollyowned and three are owned by us in joint ventures these joint venture properties provide us with a potential acquisition pipeline in the future twelve properties are scheduled for completion in 2008 11 of which are whollyowned and one of which will be owned by us in a consolidated joint venture 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and 

assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those that impact our most critical accounting policies we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies 

consolidation we follow fasb interpretation no 46r  consolidation of variable interest entities  fin 46r which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities vies under fin 46r arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as vies an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it is the primary beneficiary of the vie 

under fin 46r a vie is created when i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii the entitys equity holders as a group either a lack direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity through voting or similar rights b are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur or c do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur if an entity is deemed to be a vie pursuant to fin 46r the enterprise that is deemed to absorb a majority of the expected losses or receive a majority of expected residual returns of the vie is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 

based on the provisions of fin 46r we have concluded that under certain circumstances when we i enter into option agreements for the purchase of land or facilities from an entity and pay a nonrefundable deposit or ii enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures a vie may be created under condition ii b or c of the previous paragraph for each vie created we have considered expected losses and residual returns based on the probability of future cash flows as outlined in fin 46r if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie the assets liabilities and operations of the vie are consolidated with our financial statements 

real estate assets real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation direct and allowable internal costs associated with the development construction renovation and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized interest property taxes and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized 

expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives depreciation is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements which are generally between five and 39 years 

in connection with our acquisition of properties the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values the value of the tangible assets consisting of land and buildings are determined as if vacant that is at replacement cost intangible assets which represent the value of existing tenant relationships are recorded at their fair values we measure the value of tenant relationships based on our historical experience with turnover in our facilities we amortize to expense the tenant relationships on a straightline basis over the average period that a tenant is expected to utilize the facility currently estimated to be 18 months 

intangible lease rights include 1 purchase price amounts allocated to leases on two properties that cannot be classified as ground or building leases these rights are amortized to expense over the term of the leases and 2 intangibles related to ground leases on four properties that were acquired in 2007 these ground leases were assumed by the company at rates that were lower than the current market rates for similar leases the value associated with these assumed leases were recorded as intangibles which will be amortized over the lease terms 

evaluation of asset impairment we evaluate longlived assets which are held for use for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment if such events occur we compare the carrying value of these longlived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets an impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the asset the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the asset 

when real estate assets are identified by management as held for sale we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the fair value net of selling costs if the estimated fair value net of selling costs of the assets that have been identified for sale are less than the net carrying value of the assets then a valuation allowance is established the operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

investments availableforsale 

we account for our investments in debt and equity securities according to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  which requires securities classified as availableforsale to be stated at fair value adjustments to fair value of availableforsale securities are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income a decline in the market value of investment securities below cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in a reduction in the carrying amount to fair value the impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established we classify our investments in auction rate securities as investments availableforsale in the accompanying balance sheet these investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss the estimation process for fair valuing the investments included consideration of such factors as issuer and insurer credit rating comparable market data if available credit enhancement structures projected yields discount rates and terminal periods 

fair value of financial instruments the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents investments availableforsale receivables other financial instruments included in other assets accounts payable and accrued expenses variable rate notes payable and other liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2007 and 2006 approximate fair value the fair value of fixed rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts at december 31 2007 and 2006 was 13 billion and 8360 million respectively the carrying value of these fixed rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts at december 31 2007 and 2006 was 12 billion and 8630 million respectively 

investments in real estate ventures our investments in real estate joint ventures where we have significant influence but not control and joint ventures which are vies in which we are not the primary beneficiary are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

under the equity method our investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures for the purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows we follow the look through approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures under this approach distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital eg a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint ventures sale of assets in which case it is reported as an investing activity 

our management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired when events or circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment an investment is impaired if managements estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value to the extent impairment has occurred and it is considered to be other than temporary the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment 

derivative instruments and hedging activities statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 133  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk are considered fair value hedges derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges 

for derivatives designated as fair value hedges changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income loss outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings 

conversion of operating partnership units conversions of operating partnership units to common stock when converted under the original provisions of the agreement are accounted for by reclassifying the underlying net book value of the units from minority interest to equity in accordance with eitf no 957  implementation issues related to the treatment of minority interest in certain real estate investment trusts  

revenue and expense recognition rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants leases are generally on monthtomonth terms prepaid rents are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the leases promotional discounts are recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period late charges administrative fees merchandise sales and truck rentals are recognized in income when earned management and franchise fee revenues are recognized monthly as services are performed and in accordance with the terms of the management agreements tenant insurance premiums are recognized as revenues over the period of insurance coverage development fee revenues are recognized as development costs are incurred equity in earnings of real estate entities is recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate entities interest income is recognized as earned 

property expenses including utilities property taxes repairs and maintenance and other costs to manage the facilities are recognized as incurred we accrue for property tax expense based upon estimates and historical trends if these estimates are incorrect the timing of expense recognition could be affected 

real estate sales we evaluate real estate sales for both sale recognition and profit recognition in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 66  accounting for sales of real estate  in general sales of real estate and related profitslosses are recognized when all consideration has changed hands and risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred certain types of continuing involvement preclude sale treatment and related profit recognition other forms of continuing involvement allow for sale recognition but require deferral of profit recognition 

income taxes we have elected to be treated as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code in order to maintain our qualification as a reit among other things we 

are required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets as a reit we are not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to our stockholders we plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex if we were to fail to meet these requirements we would be subject to federal income tax we are subject to certain state and local taxes provision for such taxes has been included in property operating expenses in our consolidated statement of operations 

we have elected to treat one of our corporate subsidiaries as a taxable reit subsidiary trs in general our trs may perform additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or nonreal estate related business except for the operation or management of health care facilities or lodging facilities or the provision to any person under a franchise license or otherwise of rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated our trs is subject to corporate federal income tax the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 109  accounting for income taxes  fas 109 under fas 109 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities there were no material deferred tax assets or liabilities as of december 31 2007 or 2006 and no material income tax provisions or the years ended december 31 2007 2006 or 2005 

we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 48  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  fin 48 an interpretation of fas 109 on january 1 2007 as a result of the implementation of fin 48 we recognized no material adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits at the adoption date of january 1 2007 there were no material unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2007 there were no material unrecognized tax benefits interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense when incurred 

stockbased compensation effective january 1 2006 we adopted sfas no 123 revised 2004  sharebased payment  sfas 123r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values sfas 123r supersedes sfas no 123  accounting for stockbased compensation  and accounting principles board opinion no 25  accounting for stock issued to employees  apb 25 we adopted sfas 123r using the modified prospective application method of adoption which requires us to record compensation cost related to nonvested stock awards as of december 31 2005 by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair value of these awards over their remaining service period with no change in historical reported earnings awards granted after december 31 2005 are valued at fair value in accordance with provisions of sfas 123r and recognized on a straight line basis over the service periods of each award

 39

  depreciation and amortization— the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is a result of additional properties acquired from the susa acquisition and other acquisitions completed throughout 2005 and 2006 

other income and expenses 

the following table sets forth information on other income and expenses for the years indicated 

   interest expense— the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2006 was due primarily to 9469 of interest expense on the mortgage loans on the 61 properties acquired in connection with the susa acquisition the increase was offset by lower interest costs on corporate borrowings and existing property debt capitalized interest during the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 was 3232 and 460 respectively 

  interest income— interest income earned in 2006 was mainly the result of the interest earned on the gross proceeds of 205275 received from the sale of stock the interest income earned in 2005 was primarily earned on the notes receivable that were obtained as part of the susa acquisition these notes receivable were paid down to 0 as of december 31 2006

funds from operations dollars in thousands except share data 

ffo provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary along with net income loss and cash flows for an understanding of our operating results we believe ffo is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings loss because net earnings loss assumes that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses we believe that the values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and ffo more accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts inc nareit as net income loss computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap excluding gains or losses on sales of operating properties plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis we believe that to further understand our performance ffo should be considered along with the reported net income loss and cash flows in accordance with gaap as presented in the consolidated financial statements 

the computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss as an indication of our performance as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions the following table sets forth the calculation of ffo dollars are in thousands except for share data

2007 operational summary 

our 2007 operating results were positive and reflected solid operating fundamentals and operational efficiency with increases in both revenues and net operating income on a samestore basis revenue increased 39 and noi increased 53 samestore expense increases were minimal with a yearonyear increase of a modest 13 revenue increases were driven mostly by rate growth to existing tenants as yearend samestore occupancy decreased to 841 as compared to 851 the previous year 

the markets of chicago columbus dallas and houston were top performers in yearonyear revenue growth at stabilized properties the markets of san franciscooakland and detroit also realized solid yearonyear increases in revenues 

markets performing below the portfolio average in yearonyear revenue growth included atlanta las vegas sacramento and phoenix properties in markets throughout florida continue to perform below the portfolio average though the occupancy began to stabilize during the three months ended december 31 2007 

outlook 

though the level of growth experienced in 2007 was less than in 2006 we continue to see strength in selfstorage fundamentals in many of our core markets we believe that the ability to increase revenues in 2008 over levels achieved in 2007 exists as field surveys show low levels of new supply and our internal customer research indicates continued demand for the selfstorage product type 

we anticipate continued competition from all operators both public and private in all of the markets in which we operate however we believe that the quality and location of our property portfolio our scale as the second largest operator of self storage our revenue management systems and experienced team give us the ability to perform well in various competitive and economic environments 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 174 million available in cash and cash equivalents we intend to use this cash to purchase additional selfstorage properties to fund development and to fund operations in the first two quarters of 2008 we are required to distribute at least 90 of our net taxable income excluding net capital gains to our stockholders on an annual basis to maintain our qualification as a reit therefore it is unlikely that we will have any substantial cash balances that could be used to meet our liquidity needs instead these needs must be met from cash generated from operations and external sources of capital 

at december 31 2007 we had 245 million par value invested in ars which are classified as availableforsale investments auction rate securities are generally longterm debt instruments that provide liquidity through a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals generally every 28 days this mechanism allows existing investors to rollover their holdings and continue to own their respective securities or liquidate their holdings by selling their securities at par our investments are in nonmortgagebacked ars are insured against loss of principal and interest and have credit ratings of aaa—aa as a result of unsuccessful auctions the interest rate is paid at libor plus 125 or 150 basis points and the liquidity of these investments has been diminished based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash including our credit line we do not anticipate that the lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to operate our business related to these failed auctions we recorded a 12 million otherthantemporary impairment charge and a 14 million temporary impairment charge to reduce the value of our investment in ars to an estimated fair value of 218 million 

on october 19 2007 we entered into a new 1000 million revolving line of credit the credit line that matures october 31 2010 we intend to use the proceeds of the credit line for general corporate purposes the credit line has an interest rate of between 100 and 205 basis points over libor depending on certain of our financial ratios the credit line is collateralized by mortgages on certain real estate assets as of december 31 2007 the credit line had 1000 million of capacity based on the assets collateralizing the credit line no amounts were outstanding on the credit line at december 31 2007 

on october 4 2004 we entered into a reverse interest rate swap the swap agreement with us bank national association relating to our existing 618 million fixed rate mortgage with wachovia bank which is due in 2009 pursuant to the swap agreement we will receive fixed interest payments of 43 and pay variable interest payments based on the onemonth libor plus 07 on a notional amount of 618 million there were no origination fees or other up front costs incurred by us in connection with the swap agreement 

as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 13 billion of debt resulting in a debt to total capitalization ratio of 566 as of december 31 2007 the ratio of total fixed rate debt and other instruments to total debt was 905 the weighted average interest rate of the total of fixed and variable rate debt at december 31 2007 was 51 

we expect to fund our shortterm liquidity requirements including operating expenses recurring capital expenditures dividends to stockholders distributions to holders of op units and interest on our outstanding indebtedness out of our operating cash flow cash on hand and borrowings under our credit line 

longterm liquidity needs 

our longterm liquidity needs consist primarily of distributions to stockholders new facility development property acquisitions principal payments under our borrowings and nonrecurring capital expenditures we do not expect that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund our long term liquidity needs and instead expect to fund such needs out of additional borrowings joint ventures with third parties and from the proceeds of public and private offerings of equity and debt we may also use op units as currency to fund acquisitions from selfstorage owners who desire taxdeferral in their exiting transactions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as 

structured finance or special purposes entities which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes further except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitments or intent to provide funding to any such entities accordingly we are not materially exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 

contractual obligations dollars in thousands 

the following table sets forth information on payments due by period at december 31 2007 

 as of december 31 2007 the weighted average interest rate for all fixed rate loans was 50 and the weighted average interest rate on all variable rate loans was 59 

financing strategy 

we will continue to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts reviewed from time to time by our board of directors although our board of directors has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur we will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or variable rate in making financing decisions we will consider factors including but not limited to 

• the interest rate of the proposed financing • the extent to which the financing impacts flexibility in managing our properties • prepayment penalties and restrictions on refinancing • the purchase price of properties acquired with debt financing • longterm objectives with respect to the financing • target investment returns • the ability of particular properties and our company as a whole to generate cash flow sufficient to cover expected debt service payments • overall level of consolidated indebtedness • timing of debt and lease maturities • provisions that require recourse and crosscollateralization • corporate credit ratios including debt service coverage debt to total capitalization and debt to undepreciated assets and • the overall ratio of fixed and variable rate debt 46 

our indebtedness may be recourse nonrecourse or crosscollateralized if the indebtedness is nonrecourse the collateral will be limited to the particular properties to which the indebtedness relates in addition we may invest in properties subject to existing loans collateralized by mortgages or similar liens on our properties or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis we may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness to refinance investments including the redevelopment of existing properties for general working capital or to purchase additional interests in partnerships or joint ventures or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable 

seasonality 

the selfstorage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations a greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from may through september historically our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of july while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early march results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

recent accounting pronouncements 

emerging issues task force eitf topic d109  determining the nature of a host contract related to a hybrid financial instrument issued in the form of a share under fasb statement no 133  topic d109 discussed at the march 15 2007 eitf meeting was effective at the beginning of the first fiscal quarter beginning after june 15 2007 topic d109 provides the sec staffs view as to how one must evaluate whether a preferred stock host contract is a debt host or an equity host it states that the determination of the nature of the host contract for a hybrid financial instrument that is whether the nature of the host contract is more akin to debt or to equity issued in the form of a share should be based on a consideration of economic characteristics and risks the sec staff believes that the consideration of the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract should be based on all the stated and implied substantive terms and features of the hybrid financial instrument this may represent a change from the way these instruments were analyzed in the past 

we elected to early adopt topic d109 which specifically relates to the issuance of preferred op units in connection with the aaaaa rentaspace acquisition that was completed during the quarter ended june 30 2007 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement no 157  fair value measurements  fas 157 fas 157 defines fair value establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements fas 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and does not require any new fair value measurements fas 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years in february 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position no 1572  effective date of fasb statement no 157  the fsp the fsp amends fas 157 to delay the effective date for fas 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis for items within its scope the fsp defers the effective date of fas 157 to fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years we have not quantified the impact that the adoption of fas 157 will have on our financial statements 

in february 2007 the fasb issued statement no 159  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  fas 159 under fas 159 a company may elect to measure eligible financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 we have not quantified the impact that the adoption of fas 159 will have on our financial statements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued revised statement no 141  business combinations  fas 141r fas 141r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the assets acquired and liabilities assumed generally assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction will be recorded at the acquisitiondate fair value with limited exceptions fas 141r will also change the accounting treatment and disclosure for certain specific items in a business combination fas 141r applies proactively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning on or after december 15 2008 we will assess the impact of fas 141r if and when a future acquisition occurs however the application of fas 141r will result in a significant change in accounting for future acquisitions after the effective date 

in december 2007 the fasb issued statement no 160  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements—an amendment of arb no 51 fas 160 fas 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary fas 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 we do not currently expect the adoption of fas 160 to have a material impact on our financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our future income cash flows and fair values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary and tax policies domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 13 billion in total debt of which 1249 million was subject to variable interest rates including the 618 million on which we have the reverse interest rate swap if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 12 million annually 

interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur further in the event of a change of that magnitude we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure 

the fair value of fixed rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts at december 31 2007 was 13 billion the carrying value of these fixed rate notes payable at december 31 2007 was 12 billion

members of our executive management team have significant experience in all aspects of the selfstorage industry and have an average of more than ten years of industry experience the senior management team has collectively acquired andor developed more than 675 properties during the past 25 years for the company the predecessor and other entities kenneth m woolley chairman and chief executive officer and richard s tanner senior vice president development have worked in the selfstorage industry since 1977 and led some of the earliest selfstorage facility development projects in the united states 

the remainder of our executive management team and their years of industry experience are as follows kent christensen executive vice president and chief financial officer 9 years charles allen executive vice president and chief legal officer 9 years and karl haas executive vice president and chief operating officer 19 years 

members of the executive management team have guided the company through substantial growth developing and acquiring over 29 billion in assets since 1996 this growth has been funded through equity offerings and more than 20 billion in private equity capital since 1998 this private equity capital has come primarily from sophisticated high networth individuals and institutional investors such as affiliates of prudential financial inc and fidelity investments 

our executive management and board of directors have a significant ownership position in the company with executive officers and directors owning approximately 44 million shares or 68 of our outstanding common stock as of february 15 2007 

industry  competition 

selfstorage facilities refers to properties that offer doityourself monthtomonth storage space rental for personal or business use selfstorage offers a costeffective and flexible storage alternative tenants rent fully enclosed spaces that can vary in size according to their specific needs and to which they have unlimited exclusive access tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units selfstorage unit sizes typically range from five feet by five feet to 20 feet by 20 feet with an interior height of eight to 12 feet properties generally have onsite managers who supervise and run the daytoday operations providing tenants with assistance as needed 

selfstorage provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions due to lifechanges or simply because of a need for storage space the mix of residential tenants using a selfstorage property is determined by a property’s local demographics and often includes people who are looking to downsize their living space or others who are not yet settled into a permanent residence 

items that residential tenants place in selfstorage properties range from cars boats and recreational vehicles to furniture household items and appliances commercial tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods records extra inventory or storage for seasonal goods 

our research has shown that tenants choose a selfstorage property based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or business making highdensity hightraffic population centers ideal locations for a selfstorage property a property’s perceived security and the general professionalism of the site managers and staff are also contributing factors to a site’s ability to successfully secure rentals although most selfstorage properties are leased to tenants on a monthtomonth basis tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time 

there are seasonal fluctuations in occupancy rates for selfstorage properties based on our experience generally there is increased leasing activity at selfstorage properties during the summer months due to the higher number of people who relocate during this period the highest level of occupancy is typically at the end of july while the lowest level of occupancy is seen in late february and early march 

since inception in the early 1970’s the selfstorage industry has experienced significant growth in the past ten years there has been even greater growth according to the selfstorage almanac the “almanac” in 1996 there were only 25180 selfstorage properties in the united states with an average occupancy rate of 885 of net rentable square feet compared to 42976 selfstorage properties in 2006 with an average occupancy rate of 830  of net rentable square feet as population densities have 

increased in the united states there has been an increase in selfstorage awareness and corresponding development which we expect will continue in the future 

increased competition has affected our business and has led to both pricing and discount pressure this has limited our ability to increase revenues in many markets in which we operate many markets have been able to absorb the increase in selfstorage development due to superior demographics and density however select markets have not been able to absorb the new facilities and have not performed as well 

we have encountered competition when we seek to acquire properties especially for brokered portfolios aggressive bidding practices have been commonplace between both public and private entities and this competition will continue to be a challenge for the company’s growth strategy 

increased development within the selfstorage industry has also led to an increased emphasis on site location property design innovation and functionality we strive to have a creative and flexible approach to our development projects and we are open to a broad array of opportunities because of this flexibility this is especially true for new sites slated for highdensity population centers to accommodate the requirements and tastes of local planning and zoning boards and to distinguish a facility from other offerings in the market due to the attractive architecture of many of our development properties we have been able to eliminate a typical barrier of entry for most selfstorage developers in areas usually reserved for more traditional retail and commercial users 

the industry is also characterized by fragmented ownership according to the 2007 almanac the top ten selfstorage companies in the united states owned approximately 116 of total us selfstorage properties and the top 50 selfstorage companies owned approximately 155 of the total us properties we believe this fragmentation will contribute to continued consolidation at some level in the future we also believe we are well positioned to be able to compete for acquisitions given our enhanced ability to access capital as a public company and our historical reputation for closing deals 

after our acquisition of the storage usa properties on july 14 2005 we became the second largest selfstorage operator in the united states we are now one of four public selfstorage reits along with public storage inc nyse psa sovran selfstorage inc nyse sss and ustoreit inc nyse ysi 

growth and investment strategies 

our primary business objectives are to maximize cash flow available for distribution to our stockholders and to achieve sustainable longterm growth in cash flow per share in order to maximize longterm stockholder value we continue to evaluate a range of growth initiatives and opportunities these include 

·   maximize the performance of properties through strategic efficient and proactive management   we plan to pursue revenue generating and expense minimizing opportunities in our operations our revenue management team will seek to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our technology system’s ability to provide realtime interactive rental rate and discount management our scale allows greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement national regional and local marketing programs which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost

·   focus on the acquisition of selfstorage properties from strategic partners and third parties   our acquisitions team will continue to pursue the acquisition of single properties and multiproperty portfolios that we believe can provide stockholder value our july 2005 acquisition of storage usa has bolstered our reputation as a reliable ethical buyer which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close nonbrokered private deals in addition our status as an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust enables flexibility when structuring deals

·   develop new selfstorage properties    we have several joint venture and whollyowned development properties and will continue to develop new selfstorage properties in our core markets our development pipeline through 2009 includes 27 projects the majority of the projects will be developed on a whollyowned basis by the company

·   expand our management business    we see the management business as a future acquisition pipeline and expect to pursue strategic relationships with owners that should strengthen our acquisition pipeline through agreements which give us first right of refusal to purchase the managed property in the event of a potential sale twelve of our 2006 acquisitions came from this channel

financing of our growth strategies 

·   acquisition and development financing 

we as guarantor and our operating partnership currently have a 100 million revolving line of credit the “credit facility” that is collateralized by our selfstorage properties as of december 31 2006 the credit facility had approximately 810 million of available capacity based on the assets collateralizing the credit facility we expect to maintain a flexible approach in financing new property acquisitions we plan to finance future acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under the credit facility traditional secured mortgage financing and additional equity offerings 

·   development joint venture financing 

we own 338 of our stabilized properties and 10 of our leaseup properties through joint ventures with third parties including affiliates of prudential financial inc in each joint venture we generally manage the daytoday operations of the underlying properties and have the right to participate in major decisions relating to sales of properties or financings by the applicable joint venture our joint venture partners typically provide most of the equity capital required for the operation of the respective business under the operating agreements for the joint ventures we typically maintain the right to receive between 170 and 500 of the available cash flow from operations after our joint venture partners have received a predetermined return and between 170 and 500 of the available cash flow from capital transactions after our joint venture partners have received a return of their capital plus such predetermined return most joint venture agreements include buysell rights as well as rights of first refusal in connection with the sale of properties by the joint venture 

·   disposition of properties 

we will continue to review our portfolio for properties or groups of properties that are not strategically located and determine whether to dispose of these properties to fund other growth 

regulation 

generally selfstorage properties are subject to various laws ordinances and regulations including regulations relating to lien sale rights and procedures changes in any of these laws or regulations as well as changes in laws such as the comprehensive environmental response and compensation liability act or cercla which increase the potential liability for environmental conditions or circumstances existing or created by tenants or others on properties or laws affecting development construction operation upkeep safety and taxation may result in significant unanticipated expenditures loss of selfstorage sites or other impairments to operations which would adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

under the americans with disabilities act of 1990 the “ada” all places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these requirements became effective in 1992 a number of additional us federal state and local laws also exist 

that may require modifications to the properties or restrict further renovations thereof with respect to access thereto by disabled persons noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature thereby requiring substantial capital expenditures to the extent our properties are not in compliance we are likely to incur additional costs to comply with the ada 

insurance activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state in accordance with the mccarranferguson act and are subject to the grammleachbliley act and the privacy regulations promulgated by the federal trade commission pursuant thereto 

property management activities are often subject to state real estate brokerage laws and regulations as determined by the particular real estate commission for each state 

changes in any of the laws governing our conduct could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business or could materially affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

employees 

as of february 15 2007 we had 1835 employees and believe our relationship with our employees to be good our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement 




 item 1a   risk factors 

an investment in our securities involves various risks all investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information contained in this annual report before trading in our securities if any of the events set forth in the following risks actually occur our business operating results prospects and financial condition could be harmed 

our performance is subject to risks associated with real estate investments we are a real estate company that derives our income from operation of our properties there are a number of factors that may adversely affect the income that our properties generate including the following 

risks related to our properties and operations 

if we are unable to promptly relet our units or if the rates upon such reletting are significantly lower than expected then our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

virtually all of our leases are on a monthtomonth basis any delay in reletting units as vacancies arise would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results in addition lower than expected rental rates upon reletting could impede our growth 

we face increasing competition for the acquisition of selfstorage properties and other assets which may impede our ability to make future acquisitions or may increase the cost of these acquisitions 

we compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of selfstorage properties and other assets including national regional and local operators and developers of selfstorage properties these competitors may drive up the price we must pay for selfstorage properties or other assets we seek to acquire or may succeed in acquiring those properties or assets themselves in addition our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive suitors because they may have greater resources may be willing to pay more or may have a more compatible operating philosophy in addition the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment properties may increase this competition will result in increased demand for these assets and therefore increased prices paid for them because of an increased interest in singleproperty acquisitions among taxmotivated individual purchasers we may pay higher prices if we purchase single properties in 

comparison with portfolio acquisitions if we pay higher prices for selfstorage properties or other assets our profitability will be reduced 

our investments in development and redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns which would harm our operating results and reduce the amount of funds available for distributions 

a key component of our growth strategy is exploring new asset development and redevelopment opportunities through strategic joint ventures and on a whollyowned basis to the extent that we engage in these development and redevelopment activities they will be subject to the following risks normally associated with these projects 

·   we may be unable to obtain financing for these projects on favorable terms or at all

·   we may not complete development projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts

·   we may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning land use building occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations and

·   occupancy rates and rents at newly developed or redeveloped properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors including market and economic conditions and may result in our investment not being profitable

in deciding whether to develop or redevelop a particular property we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring the property up to the standards established for its intended market position or may be unable to increase occupancy at a newly acquired property as quickly as expected or at all any substantial unanticipated delays or expenses could adversely affect the investment returns from these development or redevelopment projects and harm our operating results liquidity and financial condition which could result in a decline in the value of our securities 

we may in the future develop selfstorage properties in geographic regions where we do not currently have a significant presence and where we do not possess the same level of familiarity with development which could adversely affect our ability to develop such properties successfully or at all or to achieve expected performance 

we rely on the investments of our joint venture partners for funding our development and redevelopment projects if our reputation in the selfstorage industry changes or the number of investors considering us an attractive strategic partner is otherwise reduced our ability to develop or redevelop properties could be affected which would limit our growth 

we may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria which may impede our growth and negatively affect our stock price 

our ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy we may not be successful in identifying suitable properties or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms or at all failure to identify or consummate acquisitions will slow our growth which could in turn adversely affect our stock price 

our ability to acquire properties on favorable terms and successfully integrate and operate them may be constrained by the following significant risks 

·   competition from local investors and other real estate investors with significant capital including other publiclytraded reits and institutional investment funds

·   competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price which could reduce our profitability

·   satisfactory completion of due diligence investigations and other customary closing conditions

·   failure to finance an acquisition on favorable terms or at all

·   we may spend more than the time and amounts budgeted to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties and

·   we may acquire properties subject to liabilities without any recourse or with only limited recourse with respect to unknown liabilities such as liabilities for cleanup of undisclosed environmental contamination claims by persons dealing with the former owners of the properties and claims for indemnification by general partners directors officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties

in addition strategic decisions by us such as acquisitions may adversely affect the price of our securities 

we may not be successful in integrating and operating acquired properties 

we expect to make future acquisitions of selfstorage properties if we acquire any selfstorage properties we will be required to integrate them into our existing portfolio the acquired properties may turn out to be less compatible with our growth strategy than originally anticipated may cause disruptions in our operations or may divert management’s attention away from daytoday operations which could impair our results of operations as a whole 

we depend upon our onsite personnel to maximize tenant satisfaction at each of our properties and any difficulties we encounter in hiring training and maintaining skilled field personnel may harm our operating performance 

we had 1618 field personnel as of february 15 2007 in the management and operation of our properties the general professionalism of our site managers and staff are contributing factors to a site’s ability to successfully secure rentals and retain tenants we also rely upon our field personnel to maintain clean and secure selfstorage properties if we are unable to successfully recruit train and retain qualified field personnel the quality of service we strive to provide at our properties could be adversely affected which could lead to decreased occupancy levels and reduced operating performance 

other selfstorage operators may employ store or a technology similar to store which could enhance their ability to compete with us 

we rely on store to support all aspects of our business operations and to help us implement new development and acquisition opportunities and strategies if other selfstorage companies obtain a license to use store or employ or develop a technology similar to store their ability to compete with us could be enhanced 

uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flow 

we maintain comprehensive liability fire flood earthquake wind as deemed necessary or as required by our lenders extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our properties with policy specifications limits and deductibles customarily carried for similar properties certain types of losses however may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable such as losses due to earthquakes hurricanes tornadoes riots acts of war or terrorism should an uninsured loss occur we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a property in addition if any such loss is insured we may be required to pay a significant deductible on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to our insurer being obligated to reimburse us for the loss or the amount of the loss may exceed our coverage for the loss as a result our operating results may be adversely affected 

increases in taxes and regulatory compliance costs may reduce our income 

costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws generally are not passed through to tenants directly and will affect us increases in income property or other taxes generally are not passed through to tenants under leases and may reduce our net income funds from operations “ffo” cash flow financial condition ability to pay or refinance our debt obligations ability to make distributions to stockholders and the trading price of our securities similarly changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which could similarly adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we do not always obtain independent appraisals of our properties and thus the consideration paid for these properties may exceed the value that may be indicated by thirdparty appraisals 

we do not always obtain thirdparty appraisals in connection with our acquisition of properties and the consideration being paid by us in exchange for those properties may exceed the value as determined by thirdparty appraisals in such cases the terms of any agreements and the valuation methods used to determine the value of the properties were determined by our senior management team 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our properties may affect our results of operations 

under various us federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations owners and operators of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigating and remediating certain hazardous substances or other regulated materials on or in such property such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such substances or materials the presence of such substances or materials or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s or operator’s ability to lease sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances or other regulated materials may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials into the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with asbestoscontaining materials 

certain environmental laws also impose liability without regard to knowledge or fault for removal or remediation of hazardous substances or other regulated materials upon owners and operators of contaminated property even after they no longer own or operate the property moreover the past or present owner or operator from which a release emanates could be liable for any personal injuries or 

property damages that may result from such releases as well as any damages to natural resources that may arise from such releases 

certain environmental laws impose compliance obligations on owners and operators of real property with respect to the management of hazardous materials and other regulated substances for example environmental laws govern the management of asbestoscontaining materials and leadbased paint failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties or other sanctions 

no assurances can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner or operator of our properties did not create any material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our properties there also exists the risk that material environmental conditions liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future finally future laws ordinances or regulations and future interpretations of existing laws ordinances or regulations may impose additional material environmental liability 

adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating results 

our operating results are dependent upon our ability to maximize occupancy levels and rental rates in our selfstorage properties adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we operate may lower our occupancy levels and limit our ability to increase rents or require us to offer rental discounts if our properties fail to generate revenues sufficient to meet our cash requirements including operating and other expenses debt service and capital expenditures our net income ffo cash flow financial condition ability to make distributions to stockholders and trading price of our securities could be adversely affected the following factors among others may adversely affect the operating performance of our properties 

·   the national economic climate and the local or regional economic climate in the markets in which we operate which may be adversely impacted by among other factors industry slowdowns relocation of businesses and changing demographics

·   periods of economic slowdown or recession rising interest rates or declining demand for selfstorage or the public perception that any of these events may occur could result in a general decline in rental rates or an increase in tenant defaults

·   local or regional real estate market conditions such as the oversupply of selfstorage or a reduction in demand for selfstorage in a particular area

·   perceptions by prospective users of our selfstorage properties of the safety convenience and attractiveness of our properties and the neighborhoods in which they are located

·   increased operating costs including need for capital improvements insurance premiums real estate taxes and utilities

·   changes in supply of or demand for similar or competing properties in an area

·   the impact of environmental protection laws

·   earthquakes hurricanes and other natural disasters terrorist acts civil disturbances or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses and

·   changes in tax real estate and zoning laws

risks related to our organization and structure 

our business could be harmed if key personnel with longstanding business relationships in the selfstorage industry terminate their employment with us 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our chairman and chief executive officer and the other members of our executive management team our executive management team has substantial experience in the selfstorage industry in addition our ability to continue to develop properties depends on the significant relationships our executive management team has developed with our institutional joint venture partners such as affiliates of prudential financial inc there is no guarantee that any of them will remain employed by us we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers the loss of services of one or more members of our executive management team particularly our chairman and chief executive officer could harm our business and our prospects 

we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business without stockholder consent which may subject us to different risks 

we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business without stockholder consent which may subject us to different risks we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business at any time without the consent of our stockholders which could result in our making investments and engaging in business activities that are different from and possibly riskier than the investments and businesses described in this document a change in our investment strategy or our entry into new lines of business may increase our exposure to other risks or real estate market fluctuations 

if other selfstorage companies convert to an upreit structure or if tax laws change we may no longer have an advantage in competing for potential acquisitions 

because we are structured as an upreit we are a more attractive acquirer of properties to taxmotivated sellers than our competitors that are not structured as upreits however if other selfstorage companies restructure their holdings to become upreits this competitive advantage will disappear in addition new legislation may be enacted or new interpretations of existing legislation may be issued by the internal revenue service “irs” or the us treasury department that could affect the attractiveness of our upreit structure so that it may no longer assist us in competing for acquisitions 

tax indemnification obligations may require the operating partnership to maintain certain debt levels 

in connection with the formation transactions entered into prior to our ipo in 2004 we agreed to make available to each of kenneth m woolley our chairman and chief executive officer richard s tanner our senior vice president development and other third parties the following tax protections for nine years with a threeyear extension if the applicable party continues to own at least 50 of the op units received by it in the formation transactions at the expiration of the initial nineyear period the opportunity to 1 guarantee debt or 2 enter into a special loss allocation and deficit restoration obligation in an aggregate amount with respect to the foregoing contributors of at least 600 million we agreed to these provisions in order to assist these contributors in preserving their tax position after their contributions these obligations may require us to maintain certain indebtedness that we would not otherwise require for our business 

our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority 

as of december 31 2006 we held interests in 348 properties through joint ventures all of these arrangements could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority our reliance on coventurers’ financial conditions and disputes between us and our coventurers we expect to continue our 

joint venture strategy by entering into more joint ventures for the purpose of developing new selfstorage properties and acquiring existing properties in such event we would not be in a position to exercise sole decisionmaking authority regarding the property partnership joint venture or other entity the decisionmaking authority regarding the properties we currently hold through joint ventures is either vested exclusively with our joint venture partners is subject to a majority vote of the joint venture partners or equally shared by us and the joint venture partners in addition investments in partnerships joint ventures or other entities may under certain circumstances involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or coventurers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions partners or coventurers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions such as a sale because neither we nor the partner or coventurer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or coventurers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers andor directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or coventurers might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our thirdparty partners or coventurers which could harm our financial condition 

kenneth m woolley our chairman and chief executive officer spencer f kirk one of our directors richard s tanner senior vice president development kent w christensen executive vice president and chief financial officer and charles l allen executive vice president and chief legal officer members of our senior management team have outside business interests which could divert their time and attention away from us which could harm our business 

kenneth m woolley our chairman and chief executive officer as well as one of our directors and certain other members of our senior management team have outside business interests these business interests include the ownership of a selfstorage property located in pico rivera california which as of december 31 2006 was in leaseup and the ownership of extra space development llc other than this property and extra space development llc the members of our senior management are not currently engaged in any other selfstorage activities outside the company in addition mr woolley’s employment agreement includes an exception to his noncompetition covenant pursuant to which he is permitted to devote a portion of his time to the management and operations of nevada west development llc formerly known as rmi development llc a multifamily business in which he has a majority ownership although mr woolley’s employment agreement requires that he devote substantially his full business time and attention to us this agreement also permits him to devote time to his outside business interests these outside business interests could interfere with his ability to devote time to our business and affairs and as a result our business could be harmed 

conflicts of interest could arise as a result of our relationship with our operating partnership 

conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates and our operating partnership or any partner thereof our directors and officers have duties to our company under applicable maryland law in connection with their management of our company at the same time we through our whollyowned subsidiary have fiduciary duties as a general partner to our operating partnership and to the limited partners under delaware law in connection with the management of our operating partnership our duties through our whollyowned subsidiary as a general partner to our operating partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our company the partnership agreement of our operating partnership does not require us to resolve such conflicts in favor of either our company or the limited partners in our operating partnership 

unless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement delaware law generally requires a general partner of a delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith fairness and loyalty and which generally prohibit such general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest 

additionally the partnership agreement expressly limits our liability by providing that neither we our direct whollyowned massachusetts business trust subsidiary as the general partner of the operating partnership nor any of our or their trustees directors or officers will be liable or accountable in damages to our operating partnership the limited partners or assignees for errors in judgment mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if we or such trustee director or officer acted in good faith in addition our operating partnership is required to indemnify us our affiliates and each of our respective trustees officers directors employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against any and all losses claims damages liabilities whether joint or several expenses including without limitation attorneys’ fees and other legal fees and expenses judgments fines settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims demands actions suits or proceedings civil criminal administrative or investigative that relate to the operations of the operating partnership provided that our operating partnership will not indemnify for 1 willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law 2 any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement or 3 in the case of a criminal proceeding the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful 

the provisions of delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement 

our management’s ownership of contingent conversion shares or ccss and contingent conversion units or ccus may cause them to devote a disproportionate amount of time to the performance of the related 14 whollyowned earlystage leaseup properties which could cause our overall operating performance to suffer 

in connection with our ipo we issued to certain contributors which included certain members of our senior management ccss andor a combination of op units and ccus the terms of the ccss and ccus provide that they will convert into our common stock and op units respectively only if the relevant 14 leaseup properties identified at the time of the ipo achieve specified performance thresholds prior to december 31 2008 as a result our directors and officers who own ccss and ccus may have an incentive to devote a disproportionately large amount of their time and attention to these properties in comparison with our remaining properties which could harm our operating results 

we may pursue less vigorous enforcement of terms of contribution and other agreements because of conflicts of interest with certain of our officers 

kenneth m woolley our chairman and chief executive officer spencer f kirk who serves as director kent w christensen executive vice president and chief financial officer charles l allen executive vice president and chief legal officer and richard s tanner senior vice president development had direct or indirect ownership interests in certain properties that were contributed to our operating partnership in the formation transactions following the completion of the formation transactions we under the agreements relating to the contribution of such interests became entitled to indemnification and damages in the event of breaches of representations or warranties made by the contributors in addition kenneth m woolley’s employment agreement includes an exception to his non 

competition covenant pursuant to which he is permitted to devote time to the management and operations of nevada west development llc formerly known as rmi development llc a multifamily business none of these contribution and noncompetition agreements was negotiated at an arm’slength basis we may choose not to enforce or to enforce less vigorously our rights under these contribution and noncompetition agreements because of our desire to maintain our ongoing relationships with the individuals party to these agreements 

certain provisions of maryland law and our organizational documents including the stock ownership limit imposed by our charter may inhibit market activity in our stock and could prevent or delay a change in control transaction 

our charter subject to certain exceptions authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a reit and to limit any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding common stock or 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limit however our board of directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership limit to any proposed transferee whose ownership could jeopardize our qualification as a reit these restrictions on ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the ownership limit may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders different ownership limits apply to the family of kenneth m woolley certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and spencer f kirk certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and certain designated investment entities as defined in our charter 

our board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder approval in addition our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares our board of directors could issue additional shares of our common stock or establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise not be in the best interests of our stockholders 

our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited 

maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances in addition our charter eliminates our directors’ and officers’ liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law as a result we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might 

otherwise exist under common law in addition we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers 

to the extent our distributions represent a return of capital for us federal income tax purposes our stockholders could recognize an increased capital gain upon a subsequent sale of common stock 

distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and not treated by us as a dividend will not be taxable to a us stockholder under current us federal income tax law to the extent those distributions do not exceed the stockholder’s adjusted tax basis in his her or its common stock but instead will constitute a return of capital and will reduce such adjusted basis if distributions result in a reduction of a stockholder’s adjusted basis in such holder’s common stock subsequent sales of such holder’s common stock will result in recognition of an increased capital gain or realized capital loss due to the reduction in such adjusted basis 

risks related to the real estate industry 

our primary business involves the ownership operation and development of selfstorage properties 

our current strategy is to own operate and develop only selfstorage properties consequently we are subject to risks inherent in investments in a single industry because investments in real estate are inherently illiquid this strategy makes it difficult for us to diversify our investment portfolio and to limit our risk when economic conditions change decreases in market rents negative tax real estate and zoning law changes and changes in environmental protection laws may also increase our costs lower the value of our investments and decrease our income which would adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

any negative perceptions of the selfstorage industry generally may result in a decline in our stock price 

to the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the selfstorage industry the value of our securities may be negatively impacted which could result in our securities trading below the inherent value of our assets 

costs associated with complying with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 may result in unanticipated expenses 

under the ada all places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these requirements became effective in 1992 a number of additional us federal state and local laws may also require modifications to our properties or restrict certain further renovations of the properties with respect to access thereto by disabled persons noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature which could result in substantial capital expenditures we have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine our compliance and we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with the ada or other legislation if one or more of our properties is not in compliance with the ada or other legislation then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the facility into compliance if we incur substantial costs to comply with the ada or other legislation our financial condition results of operations cash flow per share trading price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected 

illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties 

because real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in our portfolio in response to changing economic financial and investment conditions is limited the real estate market is affected by many factors such as general economic conditions availability of financing interest rates and other factors including supply and demand that are beyond our control we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property 

we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold we cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements in acquiring a property we may agree to transfer restrictions that materially restrict us from selling that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property these transfer restrictions would impede our ability to sell a property even if we deem it necessary or appropriate 

any investments in unimproved real property may take significantly longer to yield incomeproducing returns if at all and may result in additional costs to us to comply with rezoning restrictions or environmental regulations 

we have invested in the past and may invest in the future in unimproved real property unimproved properties generally take longer to yield incomeproducing returns based on the typical time required for development any development of unimproved property may also expose us to the risks and uncertainties associated with rezoning the land for a higher use or development and environmental concerns of governmental entities andor community groups any unsuccessful investments or delays in realizing an incomeproducing return or increased costs to develop unimproved real estate could restrict our ability to earn our targeted rate of return on an investment or adversely affect our ability to pay operating expenses which would harm our financial condition and operating results 

risks related to our debt financings 

required payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our properties or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations 

as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 9482 million of outstanding indebtedness we expect to incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions we may borrow under our line of credit or borrow new funds to acquire these future properties additionally we do not anticipate that our internally generated cash flow will be adequate to repay our existing indebtedness upon maturity and therefore we expect to repay our indebtedness through refinancings and equity andor debt offerings further we may need to borrow funds to make distributions required to maintain our qualification as a reit or to meet our expected distributions 

if we are required to utilize our line of credit for purposes other than acquisition activity this will reduce the amount available for acquisitions and could slow our growth therefore our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences including the following 

·   our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments

·   we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms including to make acquisitions or distributions required to maintain our qualification as a reit

·   we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness

·   because a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates an increase in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense

·   we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties possibly on disadvantageous terms

·   after debt service the amount available for distributions to our stockholders is reduced

·   our debt level could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt

·   we may experience increased vulnerability to economic and industry downturns reducing our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions

·   we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases

·   we may violate restrictive covenants in our loan documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations and

·   our default under any one of our mortgage loans with crossdefault or crosscollateralization provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness or result in the foreclosures of other properties

we could become highly leveraged in the future because our organizational documents contain no limitation on the amount of debt we may incur 

our organizational documents contain no limitations on the amount of indebtedness that we or our operating partnership may incur we could alter the balance between our total outstanding indebtedness and the value of our portfolio at any time if we become more highly leveraged then the resulting increase in debt service could adversely affect our ability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness and to pay our anticipated distributions andor the distributions required to maintain our reit qualification and could harm our financial condition 

increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and make distributions to our stockholders 

as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 9482 million of debt outstanding of which approximately 851 million or 90 was subject to variable interest rates including 618 million on which we had a reverse interest rate swap this variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 66 per annum increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase our interest expense which could harm our cash flow and our ability to pay distributions for example if market rates of interest on this variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 09 million annually 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations 

in certain cases we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements hedging involves risks such as the risk that the counterparty may fail to honor its obligations under an arrangement failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

risks related to qualification and operation as a reit 

to maintain our qualification as a reit we may be forced to borrow funds on a shortterm basis during unfavorable market conditions 

to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our net taxable income each year excluding net capital gains and we are subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income each year in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions made by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years in order to maintain our reit qualification and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis or possibly longterm to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these borrowing needs could result from a difference in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for us federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt amortization payments 

dividends payable by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates 

the maximum us federal income tax rate for dividends paid by domestic corporations to individual us stockholders is 15 through 2008 dividends paid by reits however are generally not eligible for the reduced rates the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause stockholders who are individuals to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits including our securities 

in addition the relative attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends which could negatively affect the value of our properties 

possible legislative or other actions affecting reits could adversely affect our stockholders 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us treasury department changes to tax laws which changes may have retroactive application could adversely affect our stockholders it cannot be predicted whether when in what forms or with what effective dates the tax laws applicable to us or our stockholders will be changed 

the power of our board of directors to revoke our reit election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders 

our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election without the approval of our stockholders if it determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a reit if we cease to qualify as a reit we would become subject to us federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our net taxable income to our stockholders which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholders 

our failure to qualify as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock 

we operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit or lose our qualification as a reit at any 

time we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution for each of the years involved because 

·   we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates

·   we also could be subject to the us federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes and

·   unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following a year during which we were disqualified

in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits this means that our us individual stockholders would be taxed on our dividends at capital gains rates and our us corporate stockholders would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends subject in each case to applicable limitations under the internal revenue code as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our securities 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the internal revenue code is greater in the case of a reit that like us holds its assets through a partnership the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the composition of our assets and sources of our gross income our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market value of our assets some of which are not susceptible to precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our net taxable income excluding capital gains in addition legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors our ability to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments 

we will pay some taxes 

even though we qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we will be required to pay some us federal state and local taxes on our income and property extra space management inc manages selfstorage properties for our joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties we jointly with extra space management inc elected to treat extra space management inc as a “taxable reit subsidiary” of our company for us federal income tax purposes a taxable reit subsidiary is a fully taxable corporation and may be limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to us in addition we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements among our tenants our taxable reit subsidiary and us are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties or if we receive payments for inventory or property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business to the extent that we are or our taxable reit subsidiary is required to pay us federal state or local taxes we will have less cash available for distribution to stockholders 

complying with reit requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 

to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the nature and diversification of our assets the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock in order to meet these tests we may be required to forego attractive business or investment opportunities thus compliance with the reit requirements may adversely affect our ability to operate solely to maximize profits

 item 2   properties 

as of december 31 2006 we owned or had ownership interests in 567 selfstorage properties located in 32 states and washington dc of these properties 219 are whollyowned and 348 are held in joint ventures in addition we managed an additional 74 properties for franchisees or third parties bringing the total numbers of properties which we own andor manage to 641 we receive a management fee equal to approximately 6 of gross revenues to manage the joint venture third party and franchise sites as of december 31 2006 we owned or had ownership interest in approximately 41 million square feet of space configured in approximately 380000 separate storage units approximately 70 of our properties are clustered around the larger population centers such as atlanta baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san francisco these markets contain aboveaverage population and income demographics for new selfstorage properties the clustering of assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale the storage usa acquisition has given us an increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in many markets where we had no previous presence 

we consider a property to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization we consider a property to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80 occupancy rate or has been open for three years 

as of december 31 2006 greater than 100000 tenants were leasing storage units at our 219 whollyowned properties primarily on a monthtomonth basis providing the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit although leases are shortterm in duration the typical tenant tends to remain at our properties for an extended period of time for properties that were stabilized as of december 31 2006 the median length of stay was approximately eleven months 

our property portfolio is a made up of different types of construction and building configurations depending on the site and the municipality where it is located most often sites are what we consider “hybrid” facilities a mix of both driveup buildings and multifloor buildings we have a number of multifloor buildings with elevator access only and a number of facilities featuring groundfloor access only 

the following table sets forth additional information regarding the occupancy of our stabilized properties on a statebystate basis as of december 31 2006 and 2005 the information as of december 31 2005 is on a pro forma basis as though all the properties owned at december 31 2006 were under our control as of december 31 2005

market information 

our common stock has been traded on the new york stock exchange “nyse” under the symbol “exr” since our ipo on august 17 2004 prior to that time there was no public market for our common stock 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the high and low bid price for our common stock as reported by the nyse and the per share dividends declared

holders of shares of common stock are entitled to receive distributions when declared by our board of directors out of any assets legally available for that purpose as a reit we are required to distribute at least 90 of our “reit taxable income” which is generally equivalent to our net taxable ordinary income determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid to our stockholders annually in order to maintain our reit qualification for us federal income tax purposes 




 37 

management and franchise fees— our taxable reit subsidiary extra space management inc manages properties owned by our joint ventures and third parties management fees generally represent 60 of cash collected from properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures the increase in management fees is due mainly to new fees associated with the susa acquisition which occurred in july 2005 through this acquisition we obtained equity interests in joint ventures which own a total of 336 properties we obtained management contracts for these new joint venture properties and also obtained over 50 new third party and franchise management contracts in conjunction with the susa acquisition

tenant insurance— tenant insurance revenue relates to a new tenant insurance program adopted in 2005 this program was started in conjunction with the susa acquisition to replace susa’s tenant insurance program

acquisition and development fees— the decrease in acquisition and development fee revenue was due to the decreased volume of development relating to joint ventures in 2005 compared to prior years

other income— other income represents primarily income from truck rentals the increase in other income is associated with the susa acquisition and other acquisitions made in 2005

expenses 

the following table sets forth information on expenses for the years indicated 

 

  

property operations— the increase in property operations expense in 2005 was primarily due to increases of 9045 associated with the susa acquisition 8852 associated with other acquisitions and 1873 from the buyout of certain joint venture interests previously accounted for using the equity method of accounting there were also increases in expenses of 733 at existing properties due to increases in utilities repairs and maintenance and property taxes which was partially offset by the decrease of 606 of property operating expenses due to the deconsolidation of certain properties in 2004 during the year ended december 31 2004 we and the predecessor opened five new properties and acquired 44 new properties during the year ended december 31 2005 we acquired 61 properties in connection with the susa acquisition and nine properties in other acquisitions

tenant insurance— tenant insurance expense for 2005 relates to a new tenant insurance program adopted in 2005 this program was started in conjunction with the susa acquisition to replace susa’s tenant insurance program

unrecovered development and acquisition costs— unrecovered development costs for 2005 decreased when compared to 2004 due to lower level of development activity

general and administrative— the significant increase in general and administrative expenses during the year ended december 31 2005 was due mainly to the increased costs associated with the management of the additional properties that have been added through acquisitions and new joint venture arrangements entered into during 2005 we incurred approximately 1500 of additional general and administrative 

expenses during 2005 relating to the integration of the susa properties and administrative systems and 601 of amortization of deferred compensation expense related to stock grants 

depreciation and amortization— the increase in depreciation and amortization expense results from more properties being open during the year ended december 31 2005 than were open during the year ended december 31 2004 due mainly to acquisitions of new properties we acquired 70 properties during 2005 61 of which were acquired in connection with the susa acquisition

other income and expenses 

the following table sets forth information on other income and expenses for the years indicated 

 

  

interest expense and loss on debt extinguishments— the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2005 was due primarily to 4312 of interest incurred on the new trust preferred debt and 7977 of interest expense on the mortgage loans on the 61 properties acquired in connection with the susa acquisition the remainder of the increase was due mainly to other new loans obtained in 2005 related to the susa acquisition and other acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2004 there was 3523 paid to extinguish debt there was no debt extinguishment expense in 2005 capitalized interest during the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 was 459 and 1213 respectively during 2005 we acquired 70 new properties which increased outstanding debt by 206198 as of december 31 2005

interest income— the significant increase in interest income for the year ended december 31 2005 when compared to the prior year was mainly the result of the interest earned on the 37667 of notes receivable that we acquired in connection with the susa acquisition these notes receivable were paid down to 12109 by december 31 2005

minority interest—fidelity preferred return— minority interest—fidelity preferred return was 0 for the year ended december 31 2005 as the fidelity minority interest was redeemed september 9 2004

minority interest—operating partnership— loss allocated to the operating partnership represents 804 of the net loss for the year ended december 31 2005 the amount allocated to minority interest was higher than in the prior year due mainly to the fact that the operating partnership was in place for a full year in 2005 compared to only the period subsequent to the ipo in 2004

loss allocated to other minority interests— there were no losses allocated to other minority interests during the year ended december 31 2005 because we redeemed or deconsolidated all other minority interests in operating properties during the year ended december 31 2004 the only other minority interest in place as of december 31 2005 is an interest in a development property which has not yet begun operations

equity in earnings of real estate ventures— the increase in equity in earnings of real estate ventures is due primarily to our purchase of new equity interests in joint ventures as a result of the susa acquisition we own joint venture interests in an additional 336 new properties

gain on sale of real estate assets— the gain on sale of real estate assets was 0 for the year ended december 31 2005 as there were no significant gains on the sale of assets during 2005 the gain on sale of real estate assets for the year ended december 31 2004 was due primarily to a gain of 1920 on the sale of our joint venture interest in a property in laguna hills california in august 2004

funds from operations 

ffo provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary along with net income loss and cash flows for an understanding of our operating results we believe ffo is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings because net earnings assume that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses we believe that the values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and ffo more accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts inc “nareit” as net income loss computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” excluding gains or losses on sales of operating properties plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis we believe that to further understand our performance ffo should be considered along with the reported net income loss and cash flows in accordance with gaap as presented in the consolidated financial statements 

the computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss as an indication of our performance as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions the following table sets forth the calculation of ffo dollars are in thousands except for share data 

 

  

samestore stabilized property results 

we consider samestore stabilized portfolio to consist of only those properties owned wholly at the beginning and at the end of the applicable periods presented and that have achieved stabilization as of the first day of such period the following table sets forth operating data for our same store portfolio we consider the following samestore presentation to be meaningful in regards to the properties shown below these results provide information relating to propertylevel operating changes without the effects of acquisitions or completed developments 

 

  

comparison of the year ended december 31 2006 to the year ended december 31 2005 

the increase in samestore rental revenues was primarily due to increased rental rates to new and existing tenants and our ability to maintain occupancy the increase in samestore operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in property taxes and utilities 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2005 to the year ended december 31 2004 

the increase in samestore rental revenues was primarily due to increased rental rates to new and existing tenants and our ability to maintain occupancy the increase in samestore operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in repairs and maintenance snow removal and property taxes

comparison of the year ended december 31 2006 to the year ended december 31 2005 

cash flows provided by operating activities were 74520 and 14771 for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to the addition of new stabilized properties including properties added as a result of the susa acquisition in addition the increase was also a result of the collection of receivables from affiliated joint ventures and related parties as a result of normal operations 

cash used in investing activities was 239778 and 614834 for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively the decrease in 2006 is primarily the result of the 530972 of cash paid in the acquisition of storage usa in 2005 offset by the increase in the acquisition of other real estate assets in 2006 versus 2005 

cash provided by financing activities was 207406 and 604387 for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively the decrease consisted primarily of additional borrowings in 2006 of 165666 versus 808936 in 2005 and net proceeds from share issuances of 197474 in 2006 versus 271537 in 2005 this was offset by repayments on borrowings of 98866 in 2006 compared to 431255 in 2005 in addition the company also paid 50005 in dividends to common stockholders in 2006 compared to 34585 in 2005 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2005 to the year ended december 31 2004 

cash flows provided by used in operating activities were 14771 and 6158 for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to the addition of new stabilized properties through the susa acquisition and other acquisitions there have also been lower cash funding requirements relating to our leaseup properties as occupancy has increased 

cash used in investing activities was 614834 and 261298 for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively the increase in 2005 is primarily the result of the 530972 of cash paid in the acquisition of storage usa this increase was offset by the fact that we acquired fewer other properties and had fewer development projects during 2005 compared to 2004 we also received principal payments of 25938 related to the notes receivable acquired in conjunction with the susa transaction during 2005 

cash provided by financing activities was 604387 and 280039 for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively the 2005 financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from share issuances of 271537 additional borrowings of 808936 including borrowings to fund the susa acquisition offset by the repayment of 431255 of line of credit and notes payable the 2004 financial activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from share issuances of 264475 additional borrowings of 418154 including borrowings to fund the purchase of 44 stabilized properties and the development of existing projects offset by the repayment of 325917 of borrowings 

2006 operational summary 

our 2006 operating results reflected a continuation of solid selfstorage fundamentals as well as positive operational momentum our acquisition of storage usa and the integration of its business processes had a positive impact on our results particularly in the areas of revenue management and technology revenue increases in 2006 were driven mostly by rate growth as yearend samestore occupancy was 855 compared with 854 as of yearend 2005 expense growth was driven by property taxes utility costs and normal increases in employeerelated expenses snow removal expenses which adversely affected our 2005 results were less of an impact during 2006 due to the decreased snowfall in the midwest and northeastern united states 

northern california phoenix and south florida were our strongest performing markets atlanta chicago dallas and houston also performed well weaker performing markets were detroit philadelphia and southern new jersey southern california which has been a leading market for several years softened somewhat and performed inline with the portfolio average 

integration efforts arising from the susa acquisition continued throughout the year and focused on the capital improvement of the susa properties these improvements we believe will have a positive effect on the properties in the future by making them more marketable to new and existing customers the majority of the work was completed during 2006 and a residual number of projects will continue into 2007 we consider the integration of the two companies now complete the benefits of scale from being the second largest operator of selfstorage in the united states began to be felt in the areas of marketing and site management 

outlook 

we anticipate continued strength in selfstorage fundamentals due to positive overall economic conditions in many of our core markets we believe that the ability to increase revenues in 2007 over levels achieved in 2006 exists we anticipate continued competition from all operators both public and private in all of the markets in which we operate however we believe that the quality and location of our property portfolio our revenue management systems and the strength of selfstorage fundamentals will provide opportunities to grow revenues in 2007 

our discounting strategies continue to evolve higher levels of discounting were felt in 2006 due to several promotional tests executed throughout the year we will continue to selectively discount certain sites and units based on occupancy availability and competitive parameters that are controlled through our centralized realtime technology systems and revenue management team 

property taxes and utility expenses are once again seen as the primary drivers of expenses in the coming year as we continue to acquire existing selfstorage facilities tax reassessments will continue to occur snow removal may also contribute to a higher level of expenses 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 708 million available in cash and cash equivalents we intend to use this cash to purchase additional selfstorage properties in the first two quarters of 2007 we are required to distribute at least 90 of our net taxable income excluding net capital gains to our stockholders on an annual basis to maintain our qualification as a reit therefore it is unlikely that we will have any substantial cash balances that could be used to meet our liquidity needs instead these needs must be met from cash generated from operations and external sources of capital 

on september 9 2004 we as guarantor and our operating partnership entered into a 1000 million revolving line of credit “credit facility” which includes a 100 million swingline subfacility the credit facility is collateralized by selfstorage properties the operating partnership intends to use the proceeds of the credit facility for general corporate purposes and acquisitions as of december 31 2006 the credit facility had approximately 810 million of available capacity based on the assets collateralizing the credit facility there was no principal balance outstanding under the credit facility as of december 31 2006 

on october 4 2004 we entered into a reverse interest rate swap with us bank national association relating to our existing 618 million fixed rate mortgage with wachovia bank which is due in 2009 pursuant to the swap agreement we will receive fixed interest payments of 43 and pay variable interest payments based on the onemonth libor plus 07 on a notional amount of 618 million there were no origination fees or other up front costs incurred by us in connection with the swap agreement 

as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 9482 million of debt resulting in a debt to total capitalization ratio of 433 as of december 31 2006 the ratio of total fixed rate debt and other instruments to total debt was 910 the weighted average interest rate of the total of fixed and variable rate debt at december 31 2006 was 55 

we expect to fund our shortterm liquidity requirements including operating expenses recurring capital expenditures dividends to stockholders distributions to holders of op units and interest on our outstanding indebtedness out of our operating cash flow cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility 

longterm liquidity needs 

our longterm liquidity needs consist primarily of distributions to stockholders new facility development property acquisitions principal payments under our borrowings and nonrecurring capital expenditures we do not expect that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund our long term liquidity needs and instead expect to fund such needs out of additional borrowings joint ventures with third parties and from the proceeds of public and private offerings of equity and debt we may also use op units as currency to fund acquisitions from selfstorage owners who desire taxdeferral in their exiting transactions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes further except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitments or intent to provide funding to any such entities accordingly we are not materially exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth information on payments due by period at december 31 2006 

 

  

as of december 31 2006 the weighted average interest rate for all fixed rate loans was 54 and the weighted average interest rate on all variable rate loans was 66 

financing strategy 

we will continue to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts determined from time to time by our board of directors although our board of directors has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur we will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or variable rate in making financing decisions our board of directors will consider factors including but not limited to 

·   the interest rate of the proposed financing

·   the extent to which the financing impacts flexibility in managing our properties

·   prepayment penalties and restrictions on refinancing

·   the purchase price of properties acquired with debt financing

·   longterm objectives with respect to the financing

·   target investment returns

·   the ability of particular properties and the company as a whole to generate cash flow sufficient to cover expected debt service payments

·   overall level of consolidated indebtedness

·   timing of debt and lease maturities

·   provisions that require recourse and crosscollateralization

·   corporate credit ratios including debt service coverage debt to total capitalization and debt to undepreciated assets and

·   the overall ratio of fixed and variable rate debt

our indebtedness may be recourse nonrecourse or crosscollateralized if the indebtedness is nonrecourse the collateral will be limited to the particular properties to which the indebtedness relates in addition we may invest in properties subject to existing loans collateralized by mortgages or similar liens on our properties or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis we may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness to refinance investments including the redevelopment of existing properties for general working capital or to purchase additional interests in partnerships or joint ventures or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable 

seasonality 

the selfstorage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations a greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from may through september historically our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of july while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early march results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” “fin 48” fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return fin 48 also provides guidance on the related derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting for interim periods disclosure and transition of uncertain tax positions fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings we have evaluated the impact of this new pronouncement and anticipate that there will be no material effect on our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our future income cash flows and fair values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary and tax policies domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 9482 million in total debt of which 851 million was subject to variable interest rates including the 618 million on which we have the reverse interest rate swap if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 09 million annually 

interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic 

activity that could occur further in the event of a change of that magnitude we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure 

the fair value of fixed rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts at december 31 2006 was 835667 the carrying value of these fixed rate notes payable at december 31 2006 was 863101

members of our executive management team have significant experience in all aspects of the selfstorage industry and have an average of more than ten years of industry experience the senior management team has collectively acquired andor developed more than 650 properties during the past 25 years for the company the predecessor and other entities kenneth m woolley chairman and chief executive officer and richard s tanner senior vice president development have worked in the selfstorage industry since 1977 and led two of the earliest selfstorage facility development projects in the united states

industry  competition 

selfstorage properties refer to properties that offer doityourself monthtomonth storage space rental for personal or business use selfstorage offers a costeffective and flexible storage alternative tenants rent fully enclosed spaces that can vary in size according to their specific needs and to which they have unlimited exclusive access tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units selfstorage unit sizes typically range from five feet by five feet to 20 feet by 20 feet with an interior height of eight to 12 feet properties generally have onsite managers who supervise and run the daytoday operations providing tenants with assistance as needed 

selfstorage provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions whether due to a lifechange or simply because of a need for storage space the mix of residential tenants using a selfstorage property is determined by a propertys local demographics and often includes people who are looking to downsize their living space or others who are not yet settled in large homes 

items that residential tenants place in selfstorage properties range from cars boats and recreational vehicles to furniture household items and appliances commercial tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods records or extra inventory or storage for seasonal goods 

our research has shown that tenants choose a selfstorage property based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or business making highdensity hightraffic population centers ideal locations for locating a selfstorage property a propertys perceived security and the general professionalism of the site managers and staff are also contributing factors to a sites ability to successfully secure rentals although most selfstorage properties are leased to tenants on a monthtomonth basis tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time 

selfstorage does have seasonal fluctuations in occupancy rates for selfstorage properties based on our experience generally there is increased leasing activity at selfstorage properties during the summer months due to the higher number of people who relocate during this period the highest level of occupancy is achieved in july and august while the lowest level of occupancy is seen in february and march 

since inception in the early 1970s the selfstorage industry has experienced significant growth in the past ten years there has been even greater growth according to the 2006 selfstorage almanac the almanac in 1995 there were only 23972 selfstorage properties in the united states with an average occupancy rate of 885 of net rentable square feet compared to 41122 selfstorage properties in 2005 with an average occupancy rate of 830 of net rentable square feet as population densities have increased in the united states there has been an increase in selfstorage awareness and corresponding development which we expect will continue in the future 

our research indicates that the factors most important to tenants when choosing a selfstorage site are a convenient location a clean environment friendly service and a professional helpful staff our experience also indicates that successfully competing in the selfstorage industry requires an experienced and dedicated management team that is supported by an efficient and flexible operating platform that is responsive to tenants needs and expectations 

increased competition has affected our business and has led to both pricing and discount pressure this has limited our ability to increase revenues in many markets in which we operate many markets have been able to absorb the increase in selfstorage development due to superior demographics and density however select markets have not been able to absorb the new facilities and have not performed as well 

we have encountered competition when we seek to acquire properties especially for brokered portfolios aggressive bidding practices have been commonplace between both public and private entities and this competition has limited our ability to grow at a more consistent pace 

increased development within the selfstorage industry has also led to an increased emphasis on site location property design innovation and functionality we strive to have a creative and flexible approach to our development projects and we are open to a broad array of opportunities because of this flexibility this is especially true for new sites slated for highdensity population centers to accommodate the requirements and tastes of local planning and zoning boards and to distinguish a facility from other offerings in the market due to the attractive architecture of many of our development properties we have been able to eliminate a typical barrier of entry for most selfstorage developers in areas usually reserved for more traditional retail and commercial users 

the industry is also characterized by fragmented ownership according to the almanac the top five selfstorage companies in the united states owned approximately 100 of total us selfstorage properties and the top 50 selfstorage companies owned approximately 153 of the total us properties we believe this fragmentation will contribute to continued consolidation at some level into the future we also believe we are well positioned to be able to compete for acquisitions given our enhanced ability to access capital as a public company and our historical reputation for closing deals 

after our acquisition of the storage usa properties on july 14 2005 we became the second largest selfstorage owner and operator in the united states we are now one of five public selfstorage reits along with public storage inc nyse psa shurgard storage centers inc nyse shu sovran selfstorage inc nyse sss and ustoreit inc nyse ysi 

growth and investment strategies 

our primary business objectives are to maximize cash flow available for distribution to our stockholders and to achieve sustainable longterm growth in cash flow per share in order to maximize longterm stockholder value our business strategy to achieve these objectives consists of the following elements 

• maximize cash flow at our properties we seek to maximize revenuegenerating opportunities by responding to changing local market conditions through interactive yield management of the rental rates and discount levels at our properties supported by store our licensed property management software we will seek to respond to changing market conditions and to maximize revenuegenerating opportunities through interactive rental rate management 

• pursue opportunities to acquire selfstorage portfolios we intend to continue to selectively acquire for cash or by utilizing units in our operating partnership as acquisition currency privatelyheld selfstorage portfolios and single selfstorage 

assets in high population density areas with an undersupply or equilibrium of selfstorage demand reflag them under the extra space storage brand name and implement our comprehensive property and operating systems so as to maximize operating performance over time 

• strategically select and develop sites we plan to continue to expand by selecting and developing new selfstorage properties with costeffective appealing construction in desirable areas based on specific data including visibility and convenience of location market occupancy and rental rates market saturation traffic count household density median household income barriers to entry and future demographic and migration trends because of the attractive architecture of many of our properties we have been able to eliminate a typical barrier of entry for most selfstorage developers in areas usually reserved for more traditional retail and commercial properties 

• continue joint venture strategy to pursue development opportunities and enhance returns we plan to grow by continuing our development activities in conjunction with our joint venture partners while mitigating the risks normally associated with earlystage development and leaseup activities where appropriate we plan to also seek to acquire properties in a capitalefficient manner in conjunction with our joint venture partners typically in these deals we seek to have a small capital interest and once our joint venture partner receives a predetermined return on its investment the remaining profits will be distributed between us and our joint venture partners 

financing of our growth strategies 

• acquisition financing we as guarantor and our operating partnership currently have a 100 million revolving line of credit that is collateralized by our selfstorage properties as of december 31 2005 the credit facility had approximately 761 million of available borrowings based on the assets collateralizing the credit facility we expect to maintain a flexible approach in financing new property acquisitions we plan to finance future acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under the credit facility traditional secured mortgage financing and additional equity offerings 

• development joint venture financing we own 341 of our stabilized properties and 13 of our leaseup properties through joint ventures with third parties including affiliates of prudential financial inc in each joint venture we generally manage the daytoday operations of the underlying properties and have the right to participate in major decisions relating to sales of properties or financings by the applicable joint venture our joint venture partners typically provide most of the equity capital required for the operation of the respective business under the operating agreements for the joint ventures we typically maintain the right to receive between 170 and 500 of the available cash flow from operations after our joint venture partners have received a predetermined return and between 170 and 500 of the available cash flow from capital transactions after our joint venture partners have received a return of its capital plus such predetermined return some joint venture agreements include buysell rights as well as rights of first refusal in connection with the sale of properties by the joint venture 

• disposition of properties we will continue to review our portfolio for properties or groups of properties that are not strategically located and determine whether to dispose of these properties to fund other growth 

regulation 

generally selfstorage properties are subject to various laws ordinances and regulations including regulations relating to lien sale rights and procedures changes in any of these laws or regulations as well as changes in laws such as the comprehensive environmental response and compensation liability act or cercla which increase the potential liability for environmental conditions or circumstances existing or created by tenants or others on properties or laws affecting development construction operation upkeep safety and taxation may result in significant unanticipated expenditures loss of selfstorage sites or other impairments to operations which would adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

under the american disabilities act the ada all places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these requirements became effective in 1992 a number of additional us federal state and local laws also exist that may require modifications to the properties or restrict further renovations thereof with respect to access thereto by disabled persons noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature thereby requiring substantial capital expenditures to the extent our properties are not in compliance we are likely to incur additional costs to comply with the ada 

insurance activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state in accordance with the mccarranferguson act and are subject to the grammleachbliley act and the privacy regulations promulgated by the federal trade commission pursuant thereto 

property management activities are often subject to state real estate brokerage laws and regulations as determined by the particular real estate commission for each state 

changes in any of the laws governing our conduct could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business or could materially affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

employees 

as of february 28 2006 we had 1943 employees and believe our relationship with our employees to be good our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement 




 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our securities involves various risks all investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information contained in this annual report before trading in our securities if any of the events set forth in the following risks actually occur our business operating results prospects and financial condition could be harmed 

our performance is subject to risks associated with real estate investments we are a real estate company that derives our income from operation of our properties there are a number of factors that may adversely affect the income that our properties generate including the following 

risks related to our properties and operations 

if we are unable to promptly relet our units or if the rates upon such reletting are significantly lower than expected then our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

virtually all of our leases are on a monthtomonth basis any delay in reletting units as vacancies arise would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results in addition lower than expected rental rates upon reletting could impede our growth 

we face increasing competition for the acquisition of selfstorage properties and other assets which may impede our ability to make future acquisitions or may increase the cost of these acquisitions 

we compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of selfstorage properties and other assets including national regional and local operators and developers of selfstorage properties these competitors may drive up the price we must pay for selfstorage properties or other assets we seek to acquire or may succeed in acquiring those properties or assets themselves in addition our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive suitors because they may have greater resources may be willing to pay more or may have a more compatible operating philosophy in addition the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment properties may increase this competition will result in increased demand for these assets and therefore increased prices paid for them because of an increased interest in singleproperty acquisitions among taxmotivated individual purchasers we may pay higher prices if we purchase single properties in comparison with portfolio acquisitions if we pay higher prices for selfstorage properties or other assets our profitability will be reduced 

our investments in development and redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns which would harm our operating results and reduce the amount of funds available for distributions 

a key component of our growth strategy is exploring new asset development and redevelopment opportunities through strategic joint ventures to the extent that we engage in these development and redevelopment activities they will be subject to the following risks normally associated with these projects 

• we may be unable to obtain financing for these projects on favorable terms or at all • we may not complete development projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts • we may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning land use building occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations and • occupancy rates and rents at newly developed or redeveloped properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors including market and economic conditions and may result in our investment not being profitable in deciding whether to develop or redevelop a particular property we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring the property up to the standards established for its intended market position or may be unable to increase occupancy at a newly acquired property as quickly as expected or at all any substantial unanticipated delays or expenses could adversely affect the investment returns from these development or redevelopment projects and harm our operating results liquidity and financial condition which could result in a decline in the value of our securities 

we may in the future develop selfstorage properties in geographic regions where we do not currently have a significant presence and where we do not possess the same level of familiarity with development which could adversely affect our ability to develop such properties successfully or at all or to achieve expected performance 

we rely to a large extent on the investments of our joint venture partners for funding our development and redevelopment projects if our reputation in the selfstorage industry changes or the number of investors considering us an attractive strategic partner is otherwise reduced our ability to develop or redevelop properties could be affected which would limit our growth 

we may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria which may impede our growth and negatively affect our stock price 

our ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are 

compatible with our growth strategy we may not be successful in identifying suitable properties or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms or at all failure to identify or consummate acquisitions will slow our growth which could in turn adversely affect our stock price 

our ability to acquire properties on favorable terms and successfully integrate and operate them may be constrained by the following significant risks 

• competition from local investors and other real estate investors with significant capital including other publiclytraded reits and institutional investment funds • competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price which could reduce our profitability • satisfactory completion of due diligence investigations and other customary closing conditions • failure to finance an acquisition on favorable terms or at all • we may spend more than the time and amounts budgeted to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties and • we may acquire properties subject to liabilities without any recourse or with only limited recourse with respect to unknown liabilities such as liabilities for cleanup of undisclosed environmental contamination claims by persons dealing with the former owners of the properties and claims for indemnification by general partners directors officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties in addition strategic decisions by us such as acquisitions may adversely affect the price of our common stock 

we may not be successful in integrating and operating acquired properties 

we expect to make future acquisitions of selfstorage properties if we acquire any selfstorage properties we will be required to integrate them into our existing portfolio the acquired properties may turn out to be less compatible with our growth strategy than originally anticipated may cause disruptions in our operations or may divert managements attention away from daytoday operations which could impair our results of operations as a whole 

we depend upon our onsite personnel to maximize tenant satisfaction at each of our properties and any difficulties we encounter in hiring training and maintaining skilled field personnel may harm our operating performance 

we have 1628 field personnel as of february 28 2006 in the management and operation of our properties the general professionalism of our site managers and staff are contributing factors to a sites ability to successfully secure rentals we also rely upon our field personnel to maintain clean and secure selfstorage properties if we are unable to successfully recruit train and retain qualified field personnel the quality of service we strive to provide at our properties could be adversely affected which could lead to decreased occupancy levels and reduced operating performance 

other selfstorage operators may employ store or a technology similar to store which could enhance their ability to compete with us 

we rely on store to support all aspects of our business operations and to help us implement new development and acquisition opportunities and strategies if other selfstorage companies obtain a license to use store or employ or develop a technology similar to store their ability to compete with us could be enhanced 

uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flow 

we maintain comprehensive liability fire flood earthquake wind as deemed necessary or as required by our lenders extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our properties with policy specifications limits and deductibles customarily carried for similar properties certain types of losses however may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable such as losses due to earthquakes hurricanes tornadoes riots acts of war or terrorism should an uninsured loss occur we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a property in addition if any such loss is insured we may be required to pay a significant deductible on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to our insurer being obligated to reimburse us for the loss or the amount of the loss may exceed our coverage for the loss as a result our operating results may be adversely affected 

increases in taxes and regulatory compliance costs may reduce our income 

costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws generally are not passed through to tenants directly and will affect us increases in income property or other taxes generally are not passed through to tenants under leases and may reduce our net income ffo cash flow financial condition ability to pay or refinance our debt obligations ability to make distributions to stockholders and the trading price of our common stock similarly changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which could similarly adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we did not always obtain independent appraisals of our properties and thus the consideration paid for these properties may exceed the value that may be indicated by thirdparty appraisals 

we do not always obtained thirdparty appraisals of the properties in connection with our acquisitions of properties and the consideration being paid by us in exchange for those properties may exceed the value as determined by thirdparty appraisals in such cases the terms of any agreements and the valuation methods used to determine the value of the properties were determined by our senior management team 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our properties may affect our results of operations 

under various us federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations owners and operators of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigating and remediating certain hazardous substances or other regulated materials on or in such property such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such substances or materials the presence of such substances or materials or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owners or operators ability to lease sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances or other regulated materials may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials into the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with asbestoscontaining materials 

certain environmental laws also impose liability without regard to knowledge or fault for removal or remediation of hazardous substances or other regulated materials upon owners and operators of contaminated property even after they no longer own or operate the property moreover the past or present owner or operator from which a release emanates could be liable for any personal injuries or 

property damages that may result from such releases as well as any damages to natural resources that may arise from such releases 

certain environmental laws impose compliance obligations on owners and operators of real property with respect to the management of hazardous materials and other regulated substances for example environmental laws govern the management of asbestoscontaining materials and leadbased paint failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties or other sanctions 

no assurances can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner or operator of our properties did not create any material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our properties there also exists the risk that material environmental conditions liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future finally future laws ordinances or regulations and future interpretations of existing laws ordinances or regulations may impose additional material environmental liability 

adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating results 

our operating results are dependent upon our ability to maximize occupancy levels and rental rates in our selfstorage properties adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we operate may lower our occupancy levels and limit our ability to increase rents or require us to offer rental discounts if our properties fail to generate revenues sufficient to meet our cash requirements including operating and other expenses debt service and capital expenditures our net income funds from operations ffo cash flow financial condition ability to make distributions to stockholders and common stock trading price could be adversely affected the following factors among others may adversely affect the operating performance of our properties 

• the national economic climate and the local or regional economic climate in the markets in which we operate which may be adversely impacted by among other factors industry slowdowns relocation of businesses and changing demographics • periods of economic slowdown or recession rising interest rates or declining demand for selfstorage or the public perception that any of these events may occur could result in a general decline in rental rates or an increase in tenant defaults • local or regional real estate market conditions such as the oversupply of selfstorage or a reduction in demand for selfstorage in a particular area • perceptions by prospective users of our selfstorage properties of the safety convenience and attractiveness of our properties and the neighborhoods in which they are located • increased operating costs including need for capital improvements insurance premiums real estate • taxes and utilities • changes in supply of or demand for similar or competing properties in an area • the impact of environmental protection laws • earthquakes hurricanes and other natural disasters terrorist acts civil disturbances or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses and • changes in tax real estate and zoning laws risks related to our organization and structure 

our business could be harmed if key personnel with longstanding business relationships in the selfstorage industry terminate their employment with us 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our chairman and chief executive officer and the other members of our executive management team our executive 

management team has substantial experience in the selfstorage industry in addition our ability to continue to develop properties depends on the significant relationships our executive management team has developed with our institutional joint venture partners such as affiliates of prudential financial inc there is no guarantee that any of them will remain employed by us we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers the loss of services of one or more members of our executive management team particularly our chairman and chief executive officer could harm our business and our prospects 

we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business without stockholder consent which may subject us to different risks 

we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business without stockholder consent which may subject us to different risks we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business at any time without the consent of our stockholders which could result in our making investments and engaging in business activities that are different from and possibly riskier than the investments and businesses described in this document a change in our investment strategy or our entry into new lines of business may increase our exposure to other risks or real estate market fluctuations 

if other selfstorage companies convert to an upreit structure or if tax laws change we may no longer have an advantage in competing for potential acquisitions 

because we are structured as an upreit we are a more attractive acquirer of property to taxmotivated sellers than our competitors that are not structured as upreits however if other selfstorage companies restructure their holdings to become upreits this competitive advantage will disappear in addition new legislation may be enacted or new interpretations of existing legislation may be issued by the internal revenue service irs or the us treasury department that could affect the attractiveness of our upreit structure so that it may no longer assist us in competing for acquisitions 

tax indemnification obligations may require the operating partnership to maintain certain debt levels 

in connection with the formation transactions we agreed to make available to each of kenneth m woolley our chairman and chief executive officer richard s tanner our senior vice president development and other third parties the following tax protections for nine years with a threeyear extension if the applicable party continues to own at least 50 of the op units received by it in the formation transactions at the expiration of the initial nineyear period the opportunity to 1 guarantee debt or 2 enter into a special loss allocation and deficit restoration obligation in an aggregate amount with respect to the foregoing contributors of at least equal to 600 million we agreed to these provisions in order to assist these contributors in preserving their tax position after their contributions these obligations may require us to maintain certain indebtedness than we would not otherwise require for our business 

our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority 

as of december 31 2005 we held interests in 354 properties through joint ventures all of these arrangements could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority our reliance on coventurers financial conditions and disputes between us and our coventurers we expect to continue our joint venture strategy by entering into more joint ventures for the purpose of developing new selfstorage properties and acquiring existing properties in such event we would not be in a position to exercise sole decisionmaking authority regarding the property partnership joint venture or other entity the decisionmaking authority regarding the properties we currently hold through joint ventures is either vested exclusively with our joint venture partners is subject to a majority vote of the joint 

venture partners or equally shared by us and the joint venture partners in addition investments in partnerships joint ventures or other entities may under certain circumstances involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or coventurers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions partners or coventurers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions such as a sale because neither we nor the partner or coventurer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or coventurers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers andor directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or coventurers might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our thirdparty partners or coventurers which could harm our financial condition 

kenneth m woolley our chairman and chief executive officer spencer f kirk one of our directors richard s tanner senior vice president development kent w christensen senior vice president chief financial officer and charles l allen senior vice president senior legal counsel members of our senior management team have outside business interests which could divert their time and attention away from us which could harm our business 

kenneth m woolley our chairman and chief executive officer as well as one of our directors and certain other members of our senior management team have outside business interests these business interests include the ownership of a selfstorage property located in pico rivera california which as of december 31 2005 was in leaseup and the ownership of extra space development llc other than this property and extra space development llc the members of our senior management are not currently engaged in any other selfstorage activities outside the company in addition mr woolleys employment agreement includes an exception to his noncompetition covenant pursuant to which he is permitted to devote a portion of his time to the management and operations of rmi development llc a multifamily business in which he has a majority ownership although mr woolleys employment agreement requires that he devote substantially his full business time and attention to us this agreement also permits him to devote time to his outside business interests these outside business interests could interfere with his ability to devote time to our business and affairs and as a result our business could be harmed 

conflicts of interest could arise as a result of our relationship with our operating partnership 

conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates on the one hand and our operating partnership or any partner thereof on the other our directors and officers have duties to our company under applicable maryland law in connection with their management of our company at the same time we through our wholly owned subsidiary have fiduciary duties as a general partner to our operating partnership and to the limited partners under delaware law in connection with the management of our operating partnership our duties through our wholly owned subsidiary as a general partner to our operating partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our company the partnership agreement of our operating partnership does not require us to resolve such conflicts in favor of either our company or the limited partners in our operating partnership 

unless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement delaware law generally requires a general partner of a delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith fairness and loyalty and which generally prohibit such general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest 

additionally the partnership agreement expressly limits our liability by providing that neither we our direct wholly owned massachusetts business trust subsidiary as the general partner of the operating partnership nor any of our or their trustees directors or officers will be liable or accountable in damages to our operating partnership the limited partners or assignees for errors in judgment mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if we or such trustee director or officer acted in good faith in addition our operating partnership is required to indemnify us our affiliates and each of our respective trustees officers directors employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against any and all losses claims damages liabilities whether joint or several expenses including without limitation attorneys fees and other legal fees and expenses judgments fines settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims demands actions suits or proceedings civil criminal administrative or investigative that relate to the operations of the operating partnership provided that our operating partnership will not indemnify for 1 willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law 2 any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement or 3 in the case of a criminal proceeding the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful 

the provisions of delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement 

our managements ownership of contingent conversion shares or ccss and contingent conversion units or ccus may cause them to devote a disproportionate amount of time to the performance of the 14 wholly owned earlystage leaseup properties which could cause our overall operating performance to suffer 

in connection with our ipo we issued to certain contributors which included certain members of our senior management ccss andor a combination of op units and ccus the terms of the ccss and ccus provide that they will convert into our common stock and op units respectively only if the relevant 14 leaseup properties identified at the time of the initial public offering achieve specified performance thresholds prior to december 31 2008 as a result our directors and officers who own ccss and ccus may have an incentive to devote a disproportionately large amount of their time and attention to these properties in comparison with our remaining properties which could harm our operating results 

we may pursue less vigorous enforcement of terms of contribution and other agreements because of conflicts of interest with certain of our officers 

kenneth m woolley our chairman and chief executive officer spencer f kirk who serves as director kent w christensen senior vice president chief financial officer charles l allen senior vice president senior legal counsel and richard s tanner senior vice president development had direct or indirect ownership interests in certain properties that were contributed to our operating partnership in the formation transactions following the completion of the formation transactions we under the agreements relating to the contribution of such interests became entitled to indemnification and damages in the event of breaches of representations or warranties made by the contributors in addition kenneth m woolleys employment agreement includes an exception to his noncompetition covenant pursuant to which he is permitted to devote time to the management and operations of rmi development llc a multifamily business none of these contribution and noncompetition agreements was negotiated on an armslength basis we may choose not to enforce or to enforce less vigorously our rights under these contribution and noncompetition agreements because of our desire to maintain our ongoing relationships with the individuals party to these agreements 

certain provisions of maryland law and our organizational documents including the stock ownership limit imposed by our charter may inhibit market activity in our stock and could prevent or delay a change in control transaction 

our charter subject to certain exceptions authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a reit and to limit any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding common stock or 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limit however our board of directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership limit to any proposed transferee whose ownership could jeopardize our qualification as a reit these restrictions on ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the ownership limit may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders different ownership limits apply to the family of kenneth m woolley certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and spencer f kirk certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and certain designated investment entities as defined in our charter 

our board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder approval in addition our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares our board of directors could issue additional shares of our common stock or establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 

our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited 

maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances in addition our charter eliminates our directors and officers liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law as a result we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law in addition we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers 

to the extent our distributions represent a return of capital for us federal income tax purposes our stockholders could recognize an increased capital gain upon a subsequent sale of common stock 

distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and not treated by us as a dividend will not be taxable to a us stockholder under current us federal income tax law to the extent those distributions do not exceed the stockholders adjusted tax basis in his her or its common stock but instead will constitute a return of capital and will reduce such adjusted basis if distributions 

result in a reduction of a stockholders adjusted basis in such holders common stock subsequent sales of such holders common stock will result in recognition of an increased capital gain or realized capital loss due to the reduction in such adjusted basis 

risks related to the real estate industry 

our primary business involves the ownership operation and development of selfstorage properties 

our current strategy is to own operate and develop only selfstorage properties consequently we are subject to risks inherent in investments in a single industry because investments in real estate are inherently illiquid this strategy makes it difficult for us to diversify our investment portfolio and to limit our risk when economic conditions change decreases in market rents negative tax real estate and zoning law changes and changes in environmental protection laws may also increase our costs lower the value of our investments and decrease our income which would adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

any negative perceptions of the selfstorage industry generally may result in a decline in our stock price 

to the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the selfstorage industry the value of our common stock may be negatively impacted which could result in our common stock trading below the inherent value of our assets 

costs associated with complying with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 may result in unanticipated expenses 

under the ada all places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these requirements became effective in 1992 a number of additional us federal state and local laws may also require modifications to our properties or restrict certain further renovations of the properties with respect to access thereto by disabled persons noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature which could result in substantial capital expenditures we have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine our compliance and we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with the ada or other legislation if one or more of our properties is not in compliance with the ada or other legislation then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the facility into compliance if we incur substantial costs to comply with the ada or other legislation our financial condition results of operations cash flow per share trading price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected 

illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties 

because real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in our portfolio in response to changing economic financial and investment conditions is limited the real estate market is affected by many factors such as general economic conditions availability of financing interest rates and other factors including supply and demand that are beyond our control we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property 

we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold we cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or 

to make those improvements in acquiring a property we may agree to transfer restrictions that materially restrict us from selling that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property these transfer restrictions would impede our ability to sell a property even if we deem it necessary or appropriate 

any investments in unimproved real property may take significantly longer to yield incomeproducing returns if at all and may result in additional costs to us to comply with rezoning restrictions or environmental regulations 

we have invested in the past and may invest in the future in unimproved real property unimproved properties generally take longer to yield incomeproducing returns based on the typical time required for development any development of unimproved property may also expose us to the risks and uncertainties associated with rezoning the land for a higher use or development and environmental concerns of governmental entities andor community groups any unsuccessful investments or delays in realizing an incomeproducing return or increased costs to develop unimproved real estate could restrict our ability to earn our targeted rate of return on an investment or adversely affect our ability to pay operating expenses which would harm our financial condition and operating results 

risks related to our debt financings 

required payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our properties or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations 

as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 8668 million of outstanding indebtedness we expect to incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions we may borrow under our line of credit or borrow new funds to acquire these future properties additionally we do not anticipate that our internally generated cash flow will be adequate to repay our existing indebtedness upon maturity and therefore we expect to repay our indebtedness through refinancings and equity andor debt offerings further we may need to borrow funds to make distributions required to maintain our qualification as a reit or to meet our expected distributions 

if we are required to utilize our line of credit for purposes other than acquisition activity this will reduce the amount available for acquisitions and could slow our growth therefore our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences including the following 

• our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments • we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms including to make acquisitions or distributions required to maintain our qualification as a reit • we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness • because a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates an increase in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense • we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties possibly on disadvantageous terms • after debt service the amount available for distributions to our stockholders is reduced • our debt level could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt • we may experience increased vulnerability to economic and industry downturns reducing our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions • we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases 15 

• we may violate restrictive covenants in our loan documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations and • our default under any one of our mortgage loans with crossdefault or crosscollateralization provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness or result in the foreclosures of other properties we could become highly leveraged in the future because our organizational documents contain no limitation on the amount of debt we may incur 

our organizational documents contain no limitations on the amount of indebtedness that we or our operating partnership may incur we could alter the balance between our total outstanding indebtedness and the value of our portfolio at any time if we become more highly leveraged then the resulting increase in debt service could adversely affect our ability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness and to pay our anticipated distributions andor the distributions required to maintain our reit qualification and could harm our financial condition 

increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and make distributions to our stockholders 

as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 8668 million of debt outstanding of which approximately 942 million or 109 will be subject to variable interest rates including 618 million on which we had a reverse interest rate swap this variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 57 per annum increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase our interest expense which could harm our cash flow and our ability to pay distributions for example if market rates of interest on this variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 10 million annually 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations 

in certain cases we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements hedging involves risks such as the risk that the counterparty may fail to honor its obligations under an arrangement failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

risks related to qualification and operation as a reit 

to maintain our qualification as a reit we may be forced to borrow funds on a shortterm basis during unfavorable market conditions 

to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our net taxable income each year excluding net capital gains and we are subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income each year in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions made by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years in order to maintain our reit qualification and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis or possibly longterm to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these borrowing needs could result from a difference in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for us federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt amortization payments 

dividends payable by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates 

the maximum us federal income tax rate for dividends paid by domestic corporations to individual us stockholders is 15 through 2008 dividends paid by reits however are generally not eligible for the reduced rates the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause stockholders who are individuals to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits including our common stock 

in addition the relative attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends which could negatively affect the value of our properties 

possible legislative or other actions affecting reits could adversely affect our stockholders 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us treasury department changes to tax laws which changes may have retroactive application could adversely affect our stockholders it cannot be predicted whether when in what forms or with what effective dates the tax laws applicable to us or our stockholders will be changed 

the power of our board of directors to revoke our reit election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders 

our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election without the approval of our stockholders if it determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a reit if we cease to qualify as a reit we would become subject to us federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our net taxable income to our stockholders which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholders 

our failure to qualify as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock 

we operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit or lose our qualification as a reit at any time we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution to you for each of the years involved because 

• we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates • we also could be subject to the us federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes and • unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following a year during which we were disqualified in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits this means that our us individual stockholders would be taxed on our dividends at capital gains rates and our us corporate stockholders would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends subject in each case to applicable limitations under the internal revenue code as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the internal revenue code is greater in the case of a reit that like us holds its assets through a partnership the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the composition of our assets and sources of our gross income our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market value of our assets some of which are not susceptible to precise determination and for which we will not obtain any independent appraisals also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our net taxable income excluding capital gains in addition legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors our ability to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments 

we will pay some taxes 

even though we qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we will be required to pay some us federal state and local taxes on our income and property extra space management inc manages selfstorage properties for our joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties we jointly with extra space management inc elected to treat extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary of our company for us federal income tax purposes a taxable reit subsidiary is a fully taxable corporation and may be limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to us in addition we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements among our tenants our taxable reit subsidiary and us are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties or if we receive payments for inventory or property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business to the extent that we are or our taxable reit subsidiary is required to pay us federal state or local taxes we will have less cash available for distribution to stockholders 

complying with reit requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 

to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the nature and diversification of our assets the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock in order to meet these tests we may be required to forego attractive business or investment opportunities thus compliance with the reit requirements may adversely affect our ability to operate solely to maximize profits

 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2005 we owned or had ownership interests in 546 selfstorage properties located in 34 states including washington dc of these properties 192 are whollyowned and 354 are held in joint ventures in addition we managed an additional 85 properties for franchisees or third parties the properties owned and operated before the storage usa acquisition operate under the trademarked extra space storage brand name we are currently implementing a rebranding program that will convert all of the storage usa properties to the extra space storage brand as of december 31 2005 we owned or had ownership interest in approximately 38 million square feet of space configured in approximately 370000 separate storage units approximately 70 of our properties are clustered around the larger population centers such as baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st 

petersburgtampa and san francisco these markets contain aboveaverage population and income demographics and high barriers to entry for new selfstorage properties the clustering of assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale the storage usa acquisition has given us the increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in many markets where we had no previous presence 

we consider a property to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization we also consider a property to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80 occupancy rate or has been open for three years these same rules have been applied to the recently acquired susa properties 

as of december 31 2005 greater than 100000 tenants were leasing storage units at our 192 whollyowned properties primarily on a monthtomonth basis providing the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit although leases are shortterm in duration the typical tenant tends to remain at our properties for an extended period of time for properties that were stabilized as of december 31 2005 the median length of stay was approximately 11 months 

the following table sets forth additional information regarding the occupancy of the stabilized properties on a statebystate basis as of december 31 2005 and 2004 the information as of december 31 2004 is on a pro forma basis as though all the properties owned at december 31 2005 were under our control as of december 31 2004 

 1 represents unit count as of december 31 2005 which may differ from december 31 2004 unit count due to unit conversions or expansions 2 represents net rentable square feet as of december 31 2005 which may differ from december 31 2004 net rentable square feet due to unit conversions or expansions 20

our properties are generally situated in convenient highly visible locations clustered around large population bases however due to certain factors we have a handful of locations outside the top metropolitan statistical areas msas that were developed or acquired based on the market familiarity with the properties or as part of a larger portfolio 

in addition to our 192 whollyowned properties and the 354 properties in which we have an ownership interest we also manage 85 properties for third parties and franchisees as of december 31 2005 bringing total properties which we own andor manage to 631 we receive a management fee equal to approximately 60 of gross revenues to manage these joint ventures third parties and franchisees sites

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report we make statements in this section that are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws for a complete discussion of forwardlooking statements see the section in this form 10k entitled statements regarding forwardlooking information certain risk factors may cause actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion for a discussion of such risk factors see the section in this form 10k entitled statements regarding forwardlooking information 

overview 

we are a fully integrated selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust or reit formed to continue the business commenced in 1977 by our predecessor companies to own operate acquire develop and redevelop professionally managed selfstorage properties since 1996 our fully integrated development and acquisition teams have completed the development or acquisition of more than 600 selfstorage properties 

in july 2005 we along with jointventure partner prudential real estate investors prei acquired storage usa susa from ge commercial finance for approximately 23 billion in cash the transaction the largest to date in the selfstorage industry made us the second largest operator of selfstorage facilities in the united states with 631 properties owned or managed in 34 states including washington dc as of december 31 2005 192 of our properties were wholly owned we held joint venture interests in 354 properties and our taxable reit subsidiary extra space management inc operated an additional 85 properties that are owned by franchisees or third parties in exchange for a management fee the properties that we own or in which we hold an ownership interest contain approximately 38 million square feet of rentable space contained in approximately 370000 units and currently serve a customer base of 275000 tenants 

the susa acquisition gives us a national platform upon which to leverage operational advertising and other economic efficiencies the acquisition also creates a builtin acquisition pipeline through various jointventure franchise and thirdparty management partners from which we can grow in the future we have also been able to retain several key executives from the susa organization as well as the majority of its field operations team 

to maximize the performance of our properties we employ a stateoftheart proprietary webbased tracking and yield management technology called store developed by our management team store enables us to analyze set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions as part of the susa acquisition we gained access to susas industry leading revenue management team revman which managed susas rental rate and discount strategies we believe that the combination of stores yield management capabilities and the systematic processes developed by revman will allow us to more proactively manage revenue in the future 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under existing leases on each of our selfstorage properties and from management fees on the properties we manage for jointventure partners franchisees and unaffiliated third parties this management fee is equal to approximately 6 of total revenues generated by the managed properties 

we operate in competitive markets often where consumers have multiple selfstorage properties from which to choose competition has impacted and will continue to impact our property results we experience minor seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity our operating results therefore depend materially on our ability to lease available selfstorage space to actively manage unit rental rates and 

on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments we believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the use of store the operating management software employed at the properties and through the use of the process developed by revman 

we continue to evaluate and implement a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to enable us to maximize stockholder value our strategies to maximize stockholder value include 

• maximize cash flow at our properties— we seek to maximize revenuegenerating opportunities by responding to changing local market conditions through interactive yield management of the rental rates at our properties • pursue opportunities to acquire selfstorage portfolios— we intend to continue to selectively acquire for cash or by utilizing op units as acquisition currency privatelyheld selfstorage portfolios and single selfstorage assets in high population density areas • strategically select and develop sites— we plan to continue to expand by selecting and developing new selfstorage properties through joint ventures • continue our joint venture strategy to pursue development opportunities and enhance returns— we plan to grow by continuing our development activities in conjunction with our joint venture partners thus mitigating the risks normally associated with earlystage development and leaseup activities where appropriate we plan to also seek to acquire properties in a capitalefficient manner in conjunction with our joint venture partners during 2005 we acquired 70 whollyowned properties and minority equity interests in 336 additional properties we completed the development of six properties in our core markets including two expansions of whollyowned properties one of these development properties is owned by us in a joint venture and the other three properties are owned by extra space development an entity in which we do not have any ownership interest but which is owned by certain members of senior management these joint venture and third party development properties provide us with a potential acquisition pipeline in the future thirteen properties are scheduled for completion in 2006 eight of which will be owned by us in a jointventure format 

as of december 31 2005 we operated 631 properties located in 34 states including washington dc of the 631 properties 192 are wholly owned 354 are held in joint ventures with third parties and an additional 85 properties are owned by franchisees or third parties and managed by us in exchange for a management fee the properties are generally situated in convenient highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san francisco these areas all enjoy above average population growth and income levels and high barriers to entry for new selfstorage properties the clustering of our assets around these population centers which has intensified following the susa acquisition enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale we consider a property to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization a property is considered to be stabilized once it has achieved an 80 occupancy rate or has been open for three years 

in the results of operations discussion below we will compare the results of our operations for the year ended december 31 2005 with historical results of operations for the predecessor for the period from january 1 2004 through august 16 2004 and with our historical results of operations for the period from august 17 2004 through december 31 2004 comparisons to any prior periods are to the historical results of the operations of the predecessor 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those that impact our most critical accounting policies we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies 

consolidation we follow fasb interpretation no 46r consolidation of variable interest entities fin 46r which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities vies under fin 46r arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as vies an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it is the primary beneficiary of the vie 

under fin 46r a vie is created when i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii the entitys equity holders as a group either a lack direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity through voting or similar rights b are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur or c do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur if an entity is deemed to be a vie pursuant to fin 46r the enterprise that is deemed to absorb a majority of the expected losses or receive a majority of expected residual returns of the vie is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 

based on the provisions of fin 46r we have concluded that under certain circumstances when we i enter into option agreements for the purchase of land or facilities from an entity and pay a nonrefundable deposit or ii enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures a vie may be created under condition ii b or c of the previous paragraph for each vie created we have considered expected losses and residual returns based on the probability of future cash flows as outlined in fin 46r if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie the assets liabilities and operations of the vie are consolidated with our financial statements 

real estate assets real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation direct and allowable internal costs associated with the development construction renovation and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized interest property taxes and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized 

expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives depreciation is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements which are generally between 5 and 39 years 

in connection with our acquisition of properties the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values the value of the tangible assets consisting of land and buildings are determined as if vacant that is at replacement cost intangible assets which represent the value of existing tenant relationships are recorded at their estimated fair values we measure the value of tenant relationships based on our historical experience with turnover in its facilities we amortize to expense the tenant relationships on a 

straightline basis over the average period that a tenant is expected to utilize the facility currently estimated to be18 months 

intangible lease rights represent purchase price amounts allocated to leases on two properties that cannot be classified as ground or building leases these rights are amortized to expense over the life of the lease 

evaluation of asset impairment we evaluate longlived assets which are held for use for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment if such events occur we compare the carrying value of these longlived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets an impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the asset the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the asset 

when real estate assets are identified by management as held for sale we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the fair value net of selling costs if the estimated fair value net of selling costs of the assets that have been identified for sale is less than the net carrying value of the assets then a valuation allowance is established the operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

investments in real estate ventures our investments in real estate joint ventures where we have significant influence but not control and joint ventures which are vies in which we are not the primary beneficiary are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

under the equity method our investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures for the purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows we follow the look through approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures under this approach distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital eg a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint ventures sale of assets in which case it is reported as an investing activity 

our management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired when events or circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment an investment is impaired if managements estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value to the extent impairment has occurred and it is considered to be other than temporary the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment 

derivative instruments and hedging activities statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended and interpreted establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk are considered fair value hedges derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges 

for derivatives designated as fair value hedges changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income loss outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings 

conversion of operating partnership units conversions of operating partnership units to common stock when converted under the original provisions of the agreement is accounted for by reclassifying the underlying net book value of the units from minority interest to equity in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 957 implementation issues related to the treatment of minority interest in certain real estate investment trusts 

revenue and expense recognition rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants leases are generally on monthtomonth terms prepaid rents are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the lease property expenses including utilities property taxes repairs and maintenance and other cost to manage the facilities are recorded as incurred 

management and franchise fee revenue and tenant insurance revenue are recognized when earned development and acquisition fee revenue is recognized ratably as development costs are incurred 

real estate sales we evaluate real estate sales for both sale recognition and profit recognition in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 66 accounting for sales of real estate in general sales of real estate and related profitslosses are recognized when all consideration has changed hands and risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred certain types of continuing involvement preclude sale treatment and related profit recognition other forms of continuing involvement allow for sale recognition but require deferral of profit recognition 

income taxes we have elected to be treated as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code in order to maintain our qualification as a reit among other things we are required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets as a reit we are not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to our stockholders we plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex if we were to fail to meet these requirements we would be subject to federal income tax we are subject to certain state and local taxes provision for such taxes has been included in real estate and other taxes in our consolidated statement of operations 

we have elected to treat certain of our existing and newly created corporate subsidiaries as taxable reit subsidiaries trs in general our trs may perform additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or nonreal estate related business except for the operation or management of health care facilities or lodging facilities or the provision to any person under a franchise license or otherwise of rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated a trs is subject to corporate federal income tax 

stockbased compensation as permitted by sfas no123 accounting for stockbased compensation as amended by sfas no 148 accounting for stock based compensation—transition and disclosure—an amendment of fasb statement no 123 we have elected to 

measure and record compensation cost relative to employee stock option costs in accordance with accounting principles board opinion apb no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations and make pro forma disclosures of net loss and basic loss per share as if the fair value method of valuing stock options had been applied under abp no 25 compensation cost is recognized for stock options granted to employees when the option price is less than the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of grant

administrative systems and 601 of amortization of deferred compensation expense related to stock grants

funds from operations 

ffo provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary along with net loss and cash flows for an understanding of our operating results ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts inc nareit as net income loss computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap excluding gains or losses on sales of properties plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis we believe that to further understand our performance ffo should be considered along with the reported net loss and cash flows in accordance with gaap as presented in the consolidated financial statements 

the computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss as an indication of our performance as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activates as a measure of our liquidity or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions the following table sets for the calculation of ffo 



samestore stabilized property results 

we consider samestore stabilized portfolio to consist of only those properties owned wholly at the beginning and at the end of the applicable periods presented and that had achieved stabilization as of the first day of such period the following table sets forth operating data for the samestore portfolio for our same store portfolio we consider the following samestore presentation to be meaningful in regards to the 38 properties shown below these results provide information relating to propertylevel operating changes without the effects of acquisitions or completed developments

cash flows provided by used in operating activities were 14771 and 6158 for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to the addition of new stabilized properties through the susa acquisition and other acquisitions there have also been lower cash funding requirements relating to our leaseup properties as occupancy has increased 

cash used in investing activities was 614834 and 261298 for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively the increase in 2005 is primarily the result of the 530972 of cash paid in the acquisition of storage usa this increase was offset by the fact that we acquired fewer other properties and had fewer development projects during 2005 compared to 2004 we also received payments of 26783 related to the notes receivable acquired in conjunction with the susa transaction during 2005 

cash provided by financing activities was 604387 and 280039 for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively the 2005 financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from share issuances of 271537 additional borrowings of 808936 including borrowings to fund the susa acquisition offset by the repayment of 431255 of line of credit and notes payable the 2004 financial activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from share issuances of 264475 additional borrowings of 418154 including borrowings to fund the purchase of 44 stabilized properties and the development of existing projects offset by the repayment of 325917 of borrowings 

2005 operational summary 

2005 proved to be both a rewarding and challenging year for us during the course of the year we became the second largest operator of selfstorage in the united states with the acquisition of susa 

and faced the expected challenges of a complex integration while attempting to maximize operational performance in a competitive marketplace 

the susa acquisition took center stage in 2005 and commanded a majority of our efforts throughout the year especially during the second and third quarters our operating results were positive as revenue levels increased compared to those seen in 2004 however our operational performance lagged internal expectations during the first six months of 2005 due to the resources required to close and integrate the susa acquisition 

operational performance improved significantly in the last six months of the year largely due to the impact of the newly acquired susa properties and more aggressive pricing and discounting strategies instituted by revman mission critical business processes were completed shortly after the closing of the transaction and the majority of the integration has been completed as a result of completing this integration we are hopeful that the recent performance trend will continue 

the florida and california markets were among our strongest performing markets both before and after the susa acquisition after the acquisition our newly strengthened markets of phoenix las vegas and washington dc were also recognized for their strong revenue growth metrochicago michigan new jersey ohio and pennsylvania were among our weakest performing markets 

competitive pressure remains a factor to performance however due to the strength of selfstorage fundamentals in many markets the ability to raise rental rates continues to be evident despite these increases many competitors are continuing with high levels of rental discounts which act as a drag on revenue 

on a samestore basis for our presusa legacy properties we experienced increased rental activity compared to 2004 while moveout activity was slightly lower the susa properties experienced increased rental activity compared to 2004 while moveout activity was slightly lower 

outlook 

we anticipate continued strength in selfstorage fundamentals due to positive economic conditions in many of our core markets we believe that the ability to increase revenues in 2006 over levels achieved in 2005 exists 

we have seen improvement in our recent yearonyear performance with both occupancy and revenue though there can be no assurance that this trend will continue we believe that positive economic conditions the quality and location of our property portfolio and the combination of technology and revman with its ability to implement realtime pricing and promotions will provide us with the opportunity to grow revenues in 2006 

we anticipate continued competition from all operators both public and private in all of the markets in which we operate despite this we expect a positive operating environment for selfstorage operators particularly for those with welllocated highly visible and efficiently managed selfstorage properties we will continue to enhance operational processes and implement technology to maximize our effectiveness as an operator 

revenue outlook 

increased revenues were seen by many operators in 2005 this was also true for us as was illustrated by positive samestore revenue growth the ability for us to leverage revman and our technology platform gives us a positive revenue outlook for 2006 we aim to achieve not the highest level of occupancy but the highest sustainable level of revenue to increase stockholder value this may mean lower occupancy levels when compared on a yearonyear basis we will also selectively discount 

certain sites and units based on occupancy availability and competitive parameters that are controlled through our point of sale software and revman 

rental discounts were flat in 2005 on our samestore portfolio compared to 2004 and remains an important factor for us our evolving system of analyzing different data as it relates to site performance competitive variables and operational experience will drive sitelevel and portfolio performance in the future the ability to proactively control discounts also rests upon the site management team and we are developing several initiatives to assist our field personnel in this regard 

with the acquisition of susa and our increased scale advertising opportunities that only a few selfstorage companies currently possess are now available to us we will continue to look at communication tools that stretch marketing dollars further while investigating marketing channels to better communicate our services to prospective customers online marketing and commercial sales are two marketing programs that will be much more prominent in 2006 especially since the acquisition of susa these programs were heavily utilized at susa and we believe that they will have a positive affect on our ability to maximize revenues over time 

expense outlook 

property taxes utilities and repairs and maintenance were the main components of 2005s increased operating expenses as we continue to acquire existing selfstorage facilities tax reassessments will continue to occur snow removal was the main factor behind the increase in repairs and maintenance and is largely uncontrollable national vendor programs have and will continue to be pursued which may drive down the cost of facility maintenance due to increased scale we are not forecasting any major increase in repairs and maintenance in 2005 we believe that through continued refinement of insurance and risk management processes that insurance costs can also be reduced 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 28653 available in cash and cash equivalents we will be required to distribute at least 90 of our net taxable income excluding net capital gains to our stockholders on an annual basis to maintain our qualification as a reit we intend to use this cash to purchase additional selfstorage properties in the first quarter of 2006 therefore it is unlikely that we will have any substantial cash balances that could be used to meet our liquidity needs instead these needs must be met from cash generated from operations and external sources of capital 

on september 9 2004 we as guarantor and our operating partnership entered into a 100 million revolving line of credit credit facility which includes a 10 million swingline sub facility the credit facility is collateralized by selfstorage properties the operating partnership intends to use the proceeds of the credit facility for general corporate purposes and acquisitions as of december 31 2005 the credit facility had approximately 761 million of available borrowings based on the assets collateralizing the credit facility there was no principal balance outstanding under the credit facility as of december 31 2005 

on october 4 2004 we entered into a reverse interest rate swap with us bank national association relating to our existing 61770 fixed rate mortgage with wachovia bank which is due 2009 pursuant to the swap agreement we will receive fixed interest payments of 430 and pay variable interest payments based on the onemonth libor plus 655 on a notional amount of 61770 there were no origination fees or other up front costs incurred by us in connection with the swap agreement 

as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 8668 million of debt resulting in a debt to total capitalization ratio of 521 as of december 31 2005 the ratio of total fixed rate debt and other instruments to total debt is 891 the weighted average interest rate of the total of fixed and variable rate debt at december 31 2005 is 53 

we expect to fund our shortterm liquidity requirements including operating expenses recurring capital expenditures dividends to stockholders distributions to holders of op units and interest on our outstanding indebtedness out of our operating cash flow cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility 

longterm liquidity needs 

our longterm liquidity needs consist primarily of distributions to stockholders new facility development property acquisitions principal payments under our borrowings and nonrecurring capital expenditures we do not expect that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund our long term liquidity needs and instead expect to fund such needs out of additional borrowings joint ventures with third parties and from the proceeds of public and private offerings of equity and debt we may also use op units as currency to fund acquisitions from selfstorage owners who desire taxdeferral in their exiting transactions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes further except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitments or intent to provide funding to any such entities accordingly we are not materially exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth information on payments due by period at december 31 2005 

 as of december 31 2005 the weighted average interest rate for all fixed rate loans was 53 and the weighted average interest rate on all variable rate loans was 57 

financing strategy 

we will continue to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts determined from time to time by our board of directors although our board of directors has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur we will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or variable rate in making financing decisions our board of directors will consider factors including but not limited to 

• the interest rate of the proposed financing • the extent to which the financing impacts flexibility in managing our properties • prepayment penalties and restrictions on refinancing 40 

• the purchase price of properties acquired with debt financing • longterm objectives with respect to the financing • target investment returns • the ability of particular properties and the company as a whole to generate cash flow sufficient to cover expected debt service payments • overall level of consolidated indebtedness • timing of debt and lease maturities • provisions that require recourse and crosscollateralization • corporate credit ratios including debt service coverage debt to total capitalization and debt to undepreciated assets and • the overall ratio of fixed and variablerate debt our indebtedness may be recourse nonrecourse or crosscollateralized if the indebtedness is nonrecourse the collateral will be limited to the particular properties to which the indebtedness relates in addition we may invest in properties subject to existing loans collateralized by mortgages or similar liens on our properties or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis we may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness to refinance investments including the redevelopment of existing properties for general working capital or to purchase additional interests in partnerships or joint ventures or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable 

seasonality 

the selfstorage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations a greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from may through september historically our highest level of occupancy has been as of the end of july while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early march results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 share—based payment sfas 123r which requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees and disallows the use of the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options but expresses no preference for a type of valuation model this statement supersedes apb no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees but does not change the accounting guidance for share—based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in sfas no 123 as originally issued sfas 123 r is effective for our year beginning january 1 2006 we intend to use the modified—prospective method to report stock compensation upon adoption of sfas 123r the stockbased compensation expense for 2006 is not expected to be materially different than the pro forma expense disclosed for 2005 under apb no 25 we will allocate the expense for unvested stock options granted prior to january 1 2006 over the vesting period unless the options are forfeited 

in june 2005 the emerging issues task force eitf released issue no 045 determining whether a general partner or the general partners as a group controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights eitf 0405 eitf 0405 creates a framework for evaluating whether a general partner or a group of general partners controls a limited partnership and therefore should consolidate the partnership eitf 0405 states that the presumption of general partner control would be overcome only when the limited partners have certain specific rights as outlined in eitf 0405 eitf 0405 is effective immediately for all newly formed limited partnerships and for existing limited partnership agreements that are modified for general partners in all other limited partnerships eitf 0405 is effective no later than the beginning of the first reporting 

period in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 currently this guidance will not materially affect our consolidated financial position results of operations or statement of cash flows 

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our future income cash flows and fair values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary and tax policies domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2005 we had 8668 million in total debt of which 942 million is subject to variable interest rates including the 618 million on which we have the reverse interest rate swap if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 10 million annually 

interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur further in the event of a change of that magnitude we may take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure 

the fair value of fixed rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts at december 31 2005 was 750527 the carrying value of these fixed rate notes payable at december 31 2005 was 772570

industry  competition 

  

selfstorage properties refer to properties that offer doityourself monthtomonth storage space rental for personal or business use selfstorage offers a costeffective and flexible storage alternative tenants rent fully enclosed spaces that can vary in size according to their specific needs and to which they have unlimited exclusive access tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units selfstorage unit sizes typically range from five feet by five feet to 20 feet by 20 feet with an interior height of eight to 12 feet 

  

selfstorage provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions whether due to a lifechange or simply because of a need for extra storage space the mix of residential tenants using a selfstorage property is determined by a property’s local demographics and often includes people who are looking to downsize their living space or others who are not yet settled in large homes 

  

the range of items residential tenants place in selfstorage properties range from cars boats and recreational vehicles to furniture household items and appliances commercial tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods records or extra inventory or storage for seasonal goods 

  

selfstorage properties provide an accessible storage alternative at a relatively low cost tenants typically rent an enclosed space to which they have unlimited exclusive access properties generally have onsite managers who supervise and run the daytoday operations providing tenants with assistance as needed 

  

the company’s research has shown that tenants choose a selfstorage property based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or business making highdensity hightraffic population centers ideal locations for locating a selfstorage property a property’s perceived security and the general professionalism of the site managers and staffs are also contributing factors to a site’s ability to successfully secure rentals although most selfstorage properties are leased to tenants on a monthtomonth basis tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time 

  

selfstorage does have seasonal fluctuations in occupancy rates for selfstorage properties based on the company’s experience generally there is increased leasing activity at selfstorage properties during the summer months due to the higher number of people who relocate during this period the highest level of occupancy is achieved in july and august while the lowest level of occupancy is seen in february and march 

  

since it’s inception in the early 1970’s the selfstorage industry has seen significant growth in the past ten years there has been even greater growth according to the 2005 selfstorage almanac the “almanac” in 1994 there were approximately 19500 selfstorage properties in the united states with an average occupancy rate of 848 of net rentable square feet compared to approximately 38800 selfstorage properties in 2004 with an average occupancy rate of 842 of net rentable square feet as population densities have increased in the united states there has been an increase in selfstorage awareness and development which the company expects will continue in the future 

  

the company has found that the factors most important to tenants when choosing a selfstorage site are a convenient location a clean environment friendly service and a professional helpful staff its experience also indicates that successfully competing in the selfstorage industry requires an experienced and dedicated management team that is supported by an efficient and flexible operating platform that is responsive to tenants’ needs and expectations 

  

increased competition has affected the company’s business and has led to both pricing and discounts pressure this has limited the company’s ability to increase revenues in many markets in which it operates many markets have been able to absorb the increase in selfstorage development due to superior demographics and density however select markets have not been able to absorb the new facilities and have not performed as well as others 

  

competition can also be seen on the acquisitions front especially with brokered portfolios bidding wars have been commonplace between both public and private entities and this competition has hindered the company’s ability to grow at a more consistent pace 

  

the growth within the industry has also led to an increased emphasis on site location property design innovation and functionality especially for new sites slated for highdensity population centers to accommodate the requirements and tastes of local planning and zoning boards and to distinguish a facility from other offerings in the market 

  

the company strives to have a creative and flexible approach to its development projects and it is open to a broad array of opportunities because of this flexibility due to the attractive architecture of many of the company’s properties the company has been able to eliminate a typical barrier of entry for most selfstorage developers in areas usually reserved for more traditional retail and commercial users 

  

the industry is also characterized by fragmented ownership according to the almanac the top five selfstorage companies in the united states owned approximately 99 of total us selfstorage properties and the top 50 selfstorage companies owned approximately 156 of the total us properties the company believes this fragmentation will contribute to continued consolidation at some level into the future the company also believes it is well positioned to be able to compete for acquisitions given its enhanced ability to access capital as a public company and its historical reputation for closing deals 

  

according to the almanac the company is the seventh largest selfstorage owner and operator in the united states as of december 31 2004 the company is now one of five selfstorage reits along with public storage inc psa shurgard storage centers inc shu sovran selfstorage inc sss and ustoreit inc ysi 

  

growth and investment strategies 

  

the company’s primary business objectives are to maximize cash flow available for distribution to its shareholders and to achieve sustainable longterm growth in cash flow per share in order to maximize longterm shareholder value the company’s business strategy to achieve these objectives consists of the following elements

the company intends to continue to selectively acquire for cash or by utilizing units in its operating partnership as acquisition currency privatelyheld selfstorage portfolios and single selfstorage assets in 

  

high population density areas with an undersupply or equilibrium of selfstorage demand reflag them under the extra space storage brand name and implement its comprehensive property and operating systems so as to maximize operating performance over time 

  

   

the company plans to continue to expand by selecting and developing new selfstorage properties through joint ventures with costeffective appealing construction in desirable areas based on specific data including visibility and convenience of location market occupancy and rental rates market saturation traffic count household density median household income barriers to entry and future demographic and migration trends because of the attractive architecture of many of the company’s properties it has been able to eliminate a typical barrier of entry for most selfstorage developers in areas usually reserved for more traditional retail and commercial properties 

  

   

the company plans to grow by continuing its development activities in conjunction with its joint venture partners while mitigating the risks normally associated with earlystage development and leaseup activities where appropriate the company plans to also seek to acquire properties in a capitalefficient manner in conjunction with its joint venture partners typically in these deals the company seeks to have a small capital interest and once its joint venture partner receives a predetermined return on its investment the remaining profits will be distributed to the joint venture partners 

  

financing of the company’s growth strategies 

  

   

on september 9 2004 the company as guarantor and its operating partnership entered into a 100 million revolving line of credit which includes a 10 million swingline subfacility the “credit facility” the credit facility is collateralized by selfstorage properties since the company’s initial public offering the company has funded substantially all of its acquisitions through the credit facility as of december 31 2004 the credit facility had approximately 635 million of available borrowings based on the assets collateralizing the credit facility the company expects to maintain a flexible approach in financing new property acquisitions the company plans to finance future acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under the credit facility traditional secured mortgage financing and additional equity offerings

overview

in connection with the initial public offering the existing holders of class a class b class c and class e units in the predecessor exchanged these units for an aggregate of 7939950 shares of common stock 1608437 operating partnership “op” units 3888843 ccs’s and 200046 ccu’s and 18885 in cash as a result of this exchange the predecessor became a wholly owned subsidiary of extra space storage lp the “operating partnership” which is a subsidiary of the company the transaction did not result in a change in the carrying value of the predecessor’s assets and liabilities because the exchange was accounted for at historical cost as a transfer of assets between companies under common control 

  

the company is a fully integrated selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust formed to continue the business commenced in 1977 by its predecessor companies to own operate acquire develop and redevelop professionally managed selfstorage properties since 1996 the company’s fully integrated development and acquisition teams have completed the development or acquisition of more than 130 selfstorage properties to maximize revenuegenerating opportunities for the properties the company employs a stateoftheart proprietary webbased tracking and yield management technology called store developed by the company’s management team store enables the company to analyze set and adjust rental rates in real time across its portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions 

  

the company derives substantially all of its revenues from rents received from tenants under existing leases on each of its selfstorage properties the company operates in competitive markets where consumers have multiple selfstorage selfstorage properties from which to choose competition has and will continue to impact the company’s results the company experiences minor seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity the company’s operating results therefore depend materially on its ability to lease available selfstorage space and on the ability of its tenants to make required rental payments the company believes it is able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the use of store the operating management software employed at the properties 

  

the company continues to evaluate a range of new growth initiatives and opportunities in order to enable it to maximize shareholder value these include

in the results of operations discussion below the company has combined the historical results of operations for the predecessor for the period from january 1 2004 through august 16 2004 with the historical results of operations for the company for the period from august 17 2004 through december 31 2004 in discussing the historical results of the operations for the company for the year ended december 31 2004 comparisons to the respective prior periods are to the historical results of operations of the predecessor 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

management of the company has prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require the company to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results may differ from these estimates the company has summarized below those accounting policies and estimates that require its most difficult subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on its financial condition and results of operations management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis these estimates are based on information currently available to management and on various other assumptions management believes are reasonable as of the date of this report 

  

   

the company determines the fair value of the real estate it acquires including land land improvements and buildings by valuing the real estate at the purchase price less any intangible assets this fair value is then allocated to land land improvements and buildings based on the company’s determination of the relative fair values of these assets 

  

the company determines the fair value of the intangible assets it acquires in accordance with purchase accounting for acquisitions by considering the value of inplace leases and the value of tenant relationships the company does not place a value on the inplace leases due to the monthtomonth terms of the leases the company values tenant relationships as two months’ projected rent end of month rent roll based on the stable nature of rentals and vacates in its selfstorage properties and the minimal amount of time and effort required to replace an existing tenant 

  

   

the company has estimated the useful life of tenant relationships to be approximately 18 months based on experience with the period of time a tenant stays in a property 

  

   

when real estate assets are identified by management as held for sale the company discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the fair value net of selling costs if the estimated fair value net of selling costs of the assets which have been identified for sale is less than the net carrying value of the assets a valuation allowance is established

2004 operational summary 

  

the 2004 year proved to be challenging for the company not only did it become a public company and overcome the requisite obstacles but it also faced strong competition in most of the markets where it operates 

  

the first three months of 2004 signaled a return to increased revenues and occupancy for the company this was also true for most public and private selfstorage operators however during the second quarter the company saw its rental activity and corresponding occupancy begin to drop on a yearonyear basis the company believes this was due to strong competitive pressures in certain markets where of the company’s properties are located high levels of discounting and aggressive pricing by certain competitors continued well into the third and fourth quarter of 2004 

  

the company also became more aggressive in terms of its promotional strategy moving from sitelevel promotions to unitlevel promotions that its software can stringently control this combination negatively affected second and third quarter results 

  

the company instituted several inhouse initiatives and marketing promotions in the third quarter these tactics combined with additional lessstringent promotional rules at properties proved to stimulate occupancy and revenue growth during the third quarter and into the fourth quarter the company witnessed positively trending improvement in both revenue and occupancy on a yearonyear basis despite increased promotional activity in the third and fourth quarters promotional discounts at the 31 wholly owned samestore properties were 241 below 2003 discounting levels 

  

the company experienced flat movein activity as compared to 2003 while moveout activity was slightly lower occupancies remained essentially flat on a yearonyear basis california florida and new jersey were the strongest regions in terms of revenue growth for the year ended december 31 2004 while massachusetts and pennsylvania were the weakest 

  

outlook 

  

the company has seen marked improvement in its recent yearonyear performance with both occupancy and revenue though there can be no assurance that this trend will continue the company believes that positive economic conditions and its use of real realtime pricing and promotions will continue to provide the company with the opportunity to grow revenues 

  

the company anticipates increased competition from all operators both public and private in all of the markets in which the company operates in 2005 despite this the company expects continued improvement in the operating climate for selfstorage operators particularly for those with welllocated highly visible and efficiently managed selfstorage properties the company will continue to enhance operational processes and implement technology to maximize its effectiveness as an operator 

  

revenue outlook 

  

2004 signaled a gradual return to increased revenues and occupancy for many operators this was also true for the company and the predecessor as illustrated by samestore revenue growth and net operating income growth with the use of the company’s store software technology the company aims to achieve not the highest level of occupancy but the highest sustainable level of revenue to increase shareholder value this may mean lower occupancy levels when compared on a yearonyear basis the company will also continue to selectively discount certain sites and units based on occupancy availability and competitive parameters that are controlled through the company’s software 

  

discounting though substantially lower in 2004 on a samestore portfolio comparison from 2003 remains an important factor for the company the company’s evolving system of analyzing different data as it relates to site performance customer behavior competitive variables and its operational experience will drive sitelevel and portfolio performance in the future 

  

as the company continues to grow media opportunities that only a few companies currently possess in the industry will become available currently select marketing programs have been targeted on a local level the company seeks to both continue to stretch its marketing dollar further and investigate other marketing channels to better communicate its services to prospective customers 

  

expense outlook 

  

property taxes and insurance costs were the main components of 2004’s increased operating expenses an increase in credit card merchant fees had both positive and negative impacts as it signified customers placing their monthly rental purchases on an autopay format that eliminates manual processes for the company’s site personnel but also resulted in higher fees the company believes that expenses such as credit card merchant fees are somewhat controllable and should be brought in line with prior years through proactive negotiating by the company in regards to the samestore group of properties the company is forecasting no major increase in repairs and maintenance in 2005 the unknown factor regarding repairs and maintenance will be the snow removal situation in the eastern united states as a result of several major storms in early 2005 the company believes that its insurance costs are controllable to an extent and is hopeful that they will decrease in the future through continued refinement of insurance and risk management processes 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

as of december 31 2004 the company had approximately 24329 available in cash and cash equivalents the company will be required to distribute at least 90 of its net taxable income excluding net capital gains to its shareholders on an annual basis to maintain its qualification as a reit the company intends to use this cash to purchase additional selfstorage properties in the first quarter of 2005 therefore it is unlikely that the company will have any substantial cash balances that could be used to meet its liquidity needs instead these needs must be met from cash generated from operations and external sources of capital 

  

on september 9 2004 the company as guarantor and its operating partnership entered into a 100 million revolving line of credit “credit facility” which includes a 10 million swingline sub facility the credit facility is collateralized by selfstorage properties the operating partnership intends to use the proceeds of the credit facility for general corporate purposes and acquisitions as of december 31 2004 the credit facility has approximately 635 million of capacity based on the assets collateralizing the credit facility the outstanding principal balance of the credit facility at december 31 2004 was 390 million and is due september 2007

the company expects to fund its shortterm liquidity requirements including operating expenses recurring capital expenditures dividends to shareholders distributions to holders of op units and interest on its outstanding indebtedness out of its operating cash flow cash on hand and borrowings under the credit facility 

  

longterm liquidity needs 

  

the company’s longterm liquidity needs consist primarily of distributions to shareholders new facility development property acquisitions principal payments under the company’s borrowings and nonrecurring capital expenditures the company does not expect that its operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund its long term liquidity needs and instead expects to fund such needs out of additional borrowings joint ventures with third parties and from the proceeds of public and private offerings of equity and debt the company may also use op units as currency to fund acquisitions from selfstorage owners who desire taxdeferral in their exiting transactions 

  

financing strategy 

  

the company will continue to employ leverage in its capital structure in amounts determined from time to time by its board of directors although its board of directors has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that the company may incur it will consider a number of factors in evaluating the company’s level of indebtedness from time to time as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or variable rate in making financing decisions the company’s board of directors will consider factors including but not limited to

as of december 31 2004 the company had 473 million in total debt of which 194 million is subject to variable interest rates including the 618 million on which the company has the reverse interest rate swap if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 19 million annually 

  

interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company’s financial instruments these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur further in the event of a change of that magnitude the company may take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects these analyses assume no changes in the company’s financial structure
