manufacturing 

we manufacture integrated circuits and discrete semiconductors through a combination of wholly owned manufacturing facilities a manufacturing facility operated jointly with another semiconductor company and thirdparty foundries and assembly and test subcontractors we manage our manufacturing assets together through one centralized organization to ensure we realize scale benefits in asset utilization purchasing volumes and overhead leverage across businesses 

in the future we expect to outsource an increased part of our internal demand for wafer foundry and packaging services to thirdparty manufacturing sources in order to increase our flexibility to accommodate increased demand 

the manufacturing of a semiconductor involves several phases of production which can be broadly divided into “frontend” and “backend” processes frontend processes take place at highly complex wafer manufacturing facilities called fabrication plants or “wafer fabs” and involve the imprinting of substrate silicon wafers with the precise circuitry required for semiconductors to function the frontend production cycle requires high levels of precision and involves as many as 300 process steps backend processes involve the assembly test and packaging of semiconductors in a form suitable for distribution in contrast to the highly complex frontend process backend processing is generally less complicated and as a result we tend to determine the location of our backend facilities based more on cost factors than on technical considerations 

we primarily focus our internal and joint venture wafer manufacturing operations on running proprietary specialty process technologies that enable us to differentiate our products on key performance features and we generally outsource wafer manufacturing in process technologies that are available at thirdparty wafer foundries when it is economical to do so in addition we increasingly focus our inhouse manufacturing on our competitive 8inch wafer facilities which predominantly run manufacturing processes in the 140 nanometer 180 nanometer and 250 nanometer process nodes this focus increases our return on invested capital and reduces capital expenditures 

our frontend manufacturing facilities use a broad range of production processes and proprietary design methods including complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos bipolar bipolar cmos bicmos and doublediffused metal on silicon oxide semiconductor dmos technologies our wafer fabs produce semiconductors with line widths ranging from 90 nanometers to 3 microns for integrated circuits and 05 microns to greater than 4 microns for discretes this broad technology portfolio enables us to meet increasing demand from customers for system solutions which require a variety of technologies 

our backend manufacturing facilities test and package many different types of products using a wide variety of processes to optimize flexibility we use shared technology platforms for our backend assembly operations most of our assembly and test activities are maintained inhouse 

the following table shows selected key information with respect to our major frontend and backend facilities 



1 joint venture with tsmc we are entitled to 60 of the joint venture’s annual capacity 

we use a large number of raw materials in our front and backend manufacturing processes including silicon wafers chemicals gases lead frames substrates molding compounds and various types of precious and other metals our most important raw materials are the raw or substrate silicon wafers we use to make our semiconductors we purchase these wafers which must meet exacting specifications from a limited number of suppliers in the geographic region in which our fabrication facilities are located at our wholly owned fabrication plants we use raw wafers ranging from 6 inches to 8 inches in size our ssmc wafer fab facility which produces 8 inch wafers is jointly owned by tsmc and ourselves emerging fabrication technologies employ larger wafer sizes and accordingly we expect that our production requirements will in the future shift towards larger substrate wafers 

we typically source our other raw materials in a similar fashion as our wafers although our portfolio of suppliers is more diverse some of our suppliers provide us with materials on a justintime basis which permits us to reduce our procurement costs and the negative cash flow consequences of maintaining inventories but exposes us to potential supply chain interruptions we purchase most of our raw materials on the basis of fixed price contracts 

due to the covid19 pandemic semiconductor supply chains have been under significant pressure as a result there has been a tendency towards longer term contracts with suppliers in exchange for capacity from an operational perspective all of our manufacturing facilities continue to operate around the world in accordance with guidance issued by local and national government authorities 

sales marketing and customers 

we market our products and solutions worldwide to a variety of oems contract manufacturers and distributors we generate demand for our products by delivering product solutions to our customers and supporting their system designin activities by providing application architecture expertise and local field application engineering support 

our sales and marketing teams are organized into five regions which are emea europe the middle east and africa the americas japan south korea and greater china and asia pacific these sales regions are responsible for managing customer relationships and creating demand for our solutions through the full ecosystem development in addition our sales and marketing teams in the regions partner with our distributors and our large number of mass market customers 

our sales and marketing strategy focuses on key defined verticals in automotive mobile industrial  iot and communication infrastructure deepening our relationship with our top oems and electronic manufacturing service customers expanding our reach to our mass market customers startups and our distribution partners and becoming their preferred supplier which we believe assists us in reducing sales volatility in challenging markets we have longstanding customer relationships with most of our customers our 10 largest oem end customers some of whom are supplied by distributors in alphabetical order are apple aptiv bosch continental denso harman auto lge samsung visteon and vitesco we also have a strong position with our distribution partners including our three largest arrow avnet and wt micro 

our revenue is primarily the sum of our direct sales to oems plus our distributors’ resale of nxp products avnet accounted for 18 of our revenue in 2021 and 17 in 2020 no other distributor accounted for greater than 10 of our revenue no oem for which we had direct sales to accounted for more than 10 of our revenue in 2021 or 2020 

research and development 

we believe that our future success depends on our ability to both improve our existing products and to develop new products for both existing and new markets we direct our research and development efforts largely to the development of new semiconductor solutions where we see significant opportunities for growth we target applications that require stringent overall system and subsystem performance as new and challenging applications proliferate we believe that many of these applications will benefit from our solutions we have assembled a global team of highly skilled semiconductor and embedded software design engineers with expertise in rf analog power management interface security and digital processing 

to outpace market growth we invest in research and development to extend or create leading market positions with an emphasis on fast growing sizable market segments such as adas invehicle networks and power management as well as edge computing to support the successful deployment in the iot with our crossover processing technology but also in emerging markets such as massive mimo in rf power and mmwave for 5g in addition we invest a few percent of our total research and development expenditures in research activities that develop fundamental new technologies or product categories that could contribute significantly to our companys growth in the future 

we annually perform a fundamental review of our business portfolio and our related new product and technology development opportunities in order to decide on changes in the allocation of our research and development resources for products targeting established markets we evaluate our research and development expenditures based on clear business need and risk assessments for breakthrough technologies and new market opportunities we look at the strategic fit and synergies with the rest of our portfolio and the size of the potential addressable market overall we allocate our research and development to maintain a healthy mix of emerging growth and mature businesses 

intellectual property 

the creation and use of intellectual property is a key aspect of our strategy to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace we seek to protect our proprietary technologies by obtaining patents trademarks domain names retaining trade secrets and defending enforcing and utilizing our intellectual property rights where appropriate we believe this strategy allows us to preserve the advantages of our products and technologies and helps us to improve the return on our investment in research and development we have a broad portfolio of approximately 9500 patent families each patent family includes all patents and patent applications originating from the same invention to protect confidential technical information and software we rely on copyright and trade secret law and enter into confidentiality agreements as applicable in situations where we believe that a third party has infringed on our intellectual property we enforce our rights through all available legal means to the extent that we determine the benefits of such actions to outweigh the costs and risks involved 

we own a number of trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business where we consider it desirable we develop names for our new products and secure trademark protection our trademarks allow us to further distinguish our company and our products and are important in our relationships with customers suppliers partners and endusers 

while our patents trademarks trade secrets and other intellectual property rights constitute valuable assets we do not view any individual right or asset as material to our operations as a whole we believe it is the combination of our proprietary technology patents knowhow and other intellectual property rights and assets that creates an advantage for our business 

in addition to obtaining our own patents and other intellectual property rights we have entered into licensing agreements and other arrangements authorizing us to use intellectual property rights confidential technical information software and other technology owned by third parties we also engage in certain instances in licensing and selling of certain of our technology patents and other intellectual property rights 

competition 

we compete with many different semiconductor companies on a global basis including with both integrated device manufacturers “idms” as well as fabless companies nearly all our competitors invest extensively in research and development manufacturing sales and marketing capabilities across a broad spectrum of product lines many of our competitors are focused on single applications or market segments most of our competitors compete with us with respect to some but not all of our product lines 

our primary key public competitors in alphabetical order include but are not limited to analog devices inc infineon technologies ag intel corp marvell technology mediatek inc microchip technology inc nvidia corp qualcomm incorporated renesas electronics corp stmicroelectronics nv and texas instruments incorporated 

the basis on which we compete varies across end markets and geographic regions this includes competing on the basis of our ability to develop new products and the underlying intellectual property in a timely manner to meet customer requirements in terms of product features quality performance warranty availability and cost in addition we are asked to deliver full system capabilities which include multiple nxp devices and enabling software this requires indepth knowledge of specific applications in target markets in order to develop robust system solutions and qualified customer support resources

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to the coronavirus covid19 pandemic 

the extent to which the coronavirus covid19 outbreak and measures taken in response thereto could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict the covid19 pandemic and measures taken in response have adversely impacted the companys financial condition and results of operations 

the novel strain of the coronavirus identified in china in late 2019 has globally spread throughout other areas such as asia europe the middle east and north america and has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and shutdowns these measures have adversely impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations the operations of our customers and those of our respective vendors and suppliers we have significant manufacturing operations in china malaysia thailand singapore taiwan the netherlands and the us and each of these countries has been affected by the outbreak and taken measures to try to contain it there is considerable uncertainty regarding such measures and potential future measures and restrictions on our access to our manufacturing facilities or on our support operations or workforce or similar limitations for our vendors and suppliers and restrictions or disruptions of transportation such as reduced availability of air transport port closures and increased border controls or closures could limit our capacity to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the outbreak has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty we experienced a significant decline in revenue in the first half of 2020 related to the covid19 outbreak and then a swift rebound in demand beginning in the third quarter of 2020 and accelerating through the fourth quarter of 2021 the situation remains uncertain and the continued spread of covid19 or variants of covid19 may result in another economic

slowdown similar or worse than what we experienced in the first half of 2020 including the possibility that it could lead to a global recession risks related to a slowdown or recession are described in our risk factor titled “significantly increased volatility and instability and unfavorable economic conditions may adversely affect our business” below 

the spread of covid19 caused us to modify our business practices including employee travel employee work locations and cancellation of physical participation in meetings events and conferences and we may reinstitute these and additional measures as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners and suppliers as we continue to respond to the covid19 situation in the communities in which we operate there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed 

the degree to which covid19 adversely impacts our future results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including but not limited to the duration and spread of the outbreak its severity the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume even after the covid19 outbreak has subsided we may experience material adverse impacts to our business as a result of the global economic impact and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows it may also heighten many of the other risks described below there are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of covid19 as a global pandemic may have and as a result the ultimate impact of the outbreak on our operations and financial results is highly uncertain and subject to change 

risks related to the semiconductor industry and the markets in which we participate 

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical 

historically the relationship between supply and demand in the semiconductor industry has caused a high degree of cyclicality in the semiconductor market semiconductor supply is partly driven by manufacturing capacity which in the past has demonstrated alternating periods of substantial capacity additions and periods in which no or limited capacity was added as a general matter semiconductor companies are more likely to add capacity in periods when current or expected future demand is strong and margins are or are expected to be high investments in new capacity can result in overcapacity which can lead to a reduction in prices and margins in response companies typically limit further capacity additions eventually causing the market to be relatively undersupplied in addition demand for semiconductors varies which can exacerbate the effect of supply fluctuations as a result of this cyclicality the semiconductor industry has in the past experienced significant downturns such as in 19971998 20012002 and in 20082009 often in connection with or in anticipation of maturing life cycles of semiconductor companies’ products and declines in general economic conditions these downturns have been characterized by diminishing demand for enduser products high inventory levels underutilization of manufacturing capacity and accelerated erosion of average selling prices the foregoing risks have historically had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

significantly increased volatility and instability and unfavorable economic conditions may adversely affect our business 

it is difficult for us our customers and suppliers to forecast demand trends we may be unable to accurately predict the extent or duration of cycles or their effect on our financial condition or result of operations and can give no assurance as to the timing extent or duration of the current or future business cycles generally or specific to the markets in which we participate in the first half of 2020 demand in the automotive market steeply declined as a result of manufacturing shutdowns by automotive oems due to the coronavirus pandemic resulting in an unforeseen negative impact to our results of operations beginning in the third quarter of 2020 demand rebounded more quickly than anticipated and accelerated through the fourth quarter of 2021 resulting in our inability to fully satisfy customer demand in 2008 and 2009 europe the united states and international markets experienced increased volatility and instability related to the global financial crisis in the event of a future decline in global economic conditions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the resulting economic decline might disproportionately affect the markets in which we participate further exacerbating a decline in our results of operations 

the semiconductor industry is highly competitive if we fail to introduce new technologies and products in a timely manner this could adversely affect our business 

the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and characterized by constant and rapid technological change short product lifecycles significant price erosion and evolving standards accordingly the success of our business depends to a significant extent on our ability to develop new technologies and products that are ultimately successful in the market the costs related to the research and development necessary to develop new technologies and products are significant and any reduction of our research and development budget could harm our competitiveness meeting evolving industry requirements and introducing new products to the market in a timely manner and at prices that are acceptable to our customers are significant factors in determining our competitiveness and success commitments to develop new products must be made well in advance of any resulting sales and technologies and standards may change during development potentially rendering our products outdated or noncompetitive before their introduction if we are unable to successfully develop new products our revenue may decline substantially moreover some of our competitors are wellestablished entities are larger than us and have greater resources than we do if these competitors increase the resources they devote to developing and marketing their products we may not be able to compete effectively any consolidation among our competitors could enhance their product offerings and financial resources further strengthening their competitive position in addition some of our competitors operate in narrow business areas relative to us allowing them to concentrate their research and development efforts directly on products and services for those areas which may give them a competitive advantage as a result of these competitive pressures we may face declining sales volumes or lower prevailing prices for our products and we may not be able to reduce our total costs in line with this declining revenue if any of these risks materialize they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the demand for our products depends to a significant degree on the demand for our customers’ end products 

the vast majority of our revenue is derived from sales to manufacturers in the automotive industrial  iot mobile and communication infrastructure demand in these markets fluctuates significantly driven by consumer spending consumer preferences the development of new technologies and prevailing economic conditions in addition the specific products in which our semiconductors are incorporated may not be successful or may experience price erosion or other competitive factors that affect the price manufacturers are willing to pay us such customers have in the past and may in the future vary order levels significantly from period to period request postponements to scheduled delivery dates modify their orders or reduce lead times this is particularly common during periods of low demand this can make managing our business difficult as it limits the predictability of future revenue it can also affect the accuracy of our financial forecasts furthermore developing industry trends including customers’ use of outsourcing and new and revised supply chain models may affect our revenue costs and working capital requirements 

if customers do not purchase products made specifically for them we may not be able to resell such products to other customers or may not be able to require the customers who have ordered these products to pay a cancellation fee the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by continued price erosion especially after a product has been on the market 

one of the results of the rapid innovation in the semiconductor industry is that pricing pressure especially on products containing older technology can be intense product life cycles are relatively short and as a result products tend to be replaced by more technologically advanced substitutes on a regular basis 

in turn demand for older technology falls causing the price at which such products can be sold to drop in some cases precipitously in order to continue profitably supplying these products we must reduce our production costs in line with the lower revenue we can expect to generate per unit usually this must be accomplished through improvements in process technology and production efficiencies if we cannot advance our process technologies or improve our efficiencies to a degree sufficient to maintain required margins we will no longer be able to make a profit from the sale of these products moreover we may not be able to cease production of such products either due to contractual obligations or for customer relationship reasons and as a result may be required to bear a loss on such products we cannot guarantee that competition in our core product markets will not lead to price erosion lower revenue or lower margins in the future should reductions in our 

manufacturing costs fail to keep pace with reductions in market prices for the products we sell this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to our business operations 

in many of the market segments in which we compete we depend on winning selection processes and failure to be selected could adversely affect our business in those market segments 

one of our business strategies is to participate in and win competitive bid selection processes to develop products for use in our customers’ equipment and products these selection processes can be lengthy and require us to incur significant design and development expenditures with no guarantee of winning a contract or generating revenue failure to win new design projects and delays in developing new products with anticipated technological advances or in commencing volume shipments of these products may have an adverse effect on our business this risk is particularly pronounced in markets where there are only a few potential customers and in the automotive market where due to the longer design cycles involved failure to win a designin could prevent access to a customer for several years our failure to win a sufficient number of these bids could result in reduced revenue and hurt our competitive position in future selection processes because we may not be perceived as being a technology or industry leader each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our global business operations expose us to international business risks that could adversely affect our business 

if any of the following international business risks were to materialize or become worse they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

• negative economic developments in economies around the world and the instability of governments and international trade arrangements such as the increase of barriers to international trade including the imposition of tariffs on imports by the united states and china the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union and the sovereign debt crisis in certain european countries 

• social and political instability in a number of countries around the world including continued hostilities and civil unrest in the middle east the instability may have a negative effect on our business financial condition and operations via our customers and volatility in energy prices and the financial markets 

• potential terrorist attacks 

• epidemics and pandemics such as the coronavirus outbreak which may adversely affect our workforce as well as our suppliers and customers 

• adverse changes in governmental policies especially those affecting trade and investment 

• volatility in foreign currency exchange rates in particular with respect to the us dollar and transfer restrictions in particular in china and 

• threats that our operations or property could be subject to nationalization and expropriation 

goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets 

goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition as a result of our acquisition of marvell’s wireless wifi connectivity business unit bluetooth technology portfolio and related assets in 2019 we recognized goodwill of 11 billion and intangible assets of 05 billion we review our goodwill and other intangible assets balance for impairment upon any indication of a potential impairment and in the case of goodwill at a minimum of once a year impairment may result from among other things a sustained decrease in share price deterioration in performance adverse market conditions adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including changes that restrict the activities of or affect the products and services we sell challenges to the validity of certain registered intellectual property reduced sales of certain products incorporating intellectual property and a variety of other factors the amount of any quantified impairment must be expensed immediately as a charge to results of operations depending on future circumstances it is possible that we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets any future determination of impairment of goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and stockholders’ equity 

in difficult market conditions our high fixed costs combined with low revenue may negatively affect our results of operations 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by high fixed costs and notwithstanding our utilization of thirdparty manufacturing capacity our production requirements are in part met by our own manufacturing facilities in less favorable industry environments like we faced in the first half of 2020 we are generally faced with a decline in the utilization rates of our manufacturing facilities due to decreases in demand for our products during such periods our fabrication plants could operate at lower loading level while the fixed costs associated with the full capacity continue to be incurred resulting in lower gross profit 

we may from time to time restructure parts of our organization any such restructuring may impact customer satisfaction and the costs of implementation may be difficult to predict 

we have previously executed restructuring initiatives and continue to assess restructure and make changes to parts of the processes in our organization if the global economy remains volatile our revenues could decline and we may be forced to take cost savings steps that could result in additional charges and materially affect our business the costs of implementing any restructurings changes or cost savings steps may differ from our estimates and any negative impacts on our revenues or otherwise of such restructurings changes or steps such as situations in which customer satisfaction is negatively impacted may be larger than originally estimated 

if we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements and social plans with our labor unions as they expire from time to time if regular or statutory consultation processes with employee representatives such as works councils fail or are delayed or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage our business and operating results could be materially harmed 

we are a party to collective bargaining agreements and social plans with our labor unions we are also required to consult with our employee representatives such as works councils on items such as restructurings acquisitions and divestitures although we believe that our relations with our employees employee representatives and unions are satisfactory no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate these agreements as they expire from time to time or to conclude the consultation processes in a timely and favorable way the impact of future negotiations and consultation processes with employee representatives could have a material impact on our financial results also if we fail to extend or renegotiate our labor agreements and social plans if significant disputes with our unions arise or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage we could incur higher ongoing labor costs or experience a significant disruption of operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our working capital needs are difficult to predict 

our working capital needs are difficult to predict and may fluctuate the comparatively long period between the time at which we commence development of a product and the time at which it may be delivered to a customer leads to high inventory and workinprogress levels the volatility of our customers’ own businesses and the time required to manufacture products also makes it difficult to manage inventory levels and requires us to stockpile products across many different specifications 

our business may be adversely affected by costs relating to product defects and we could be faced with product liability and warranty claims 

we make highly complex electronic components and accordingly there is a risk that defects may occur in any of our products such defects can give rise to significant costs including expenses relating to recalling products replacing defective items writing down defective inventory and loss of potential sales in addition the occurrence of such defects may give rise to product liability and warranty claims including liability for damages caused by such defects if we release defective products into the market our reputation could suffer and we may lose sales opportunities and incur liability for damages moreover since the cost of replacing defective semiconductor devices is often much higher than the value of the devices themselves we may at times face damage claims from customers in excess of the amounts they pay us for our products including consequential damages we also face exposure to potential liability resulting from the fact that our customers typically integrate the semiconductors we sell into numerous consumer products which are then sold into the marketplace we are exposed to product liability claims if our semiconductors or the consumer products based on them malfunction and result in personal injury or death we may be named in product liability claims even if there is no evidence that our products caused the damage in question and such claims could result in significant costs 

and expenses relating to attorneys’ fees and damages in addition our customers may recall their products if they prove to be defective or make compensatory payments in accordance with industry or business practice or in order to maintain good customer relationships if such a recall or payment is caused by a defect in one of our products our customers may seek to recover all or a portion of their losses from us if any of these risks materialize our reputation would be harmed and there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face risks related to security vulnerabilities in our products 

we and third parties regularly identify security vulnerabilities with respect to our products and services the same holds for the operating systems and workloads that run on them and the components that interact with them components and ip we purchase or license from third parties for use in our products as well as industrystandard specifications we implement in our products are also regularly subject to security vulnerabilities as we have become a more datacentric company our processors and other products are being used in additional and new and critical application areas that create new or increased cybersecurity privacy or safety risks this includes applications that gather and process large amounts of data such as the cloud or internet of things and critical infrastructure and automotive applications we our customers and the users of our products do not always promptly learn of or have the ability to fully assess the magnitude or effects of a vulnerability including the extent if any to which a vulnerability has been exploited additionally new information can subsequently develop that may impact our assessment of a security vulnerability including additional information learned as we develop and deploy mitigations or updates become aware of additional variants and evaluate the competitiveness of existing and new products 

security vulnerabilities and any limitations of or adverse effects resulting from mitigation techniques can adversely affect our results of operations financial condition sales branding customer relationships share price prospects and reputation in a number of ways any of which may be material 

adverse publicity about security vulnerabilities or mitigations could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services these effects may be greater to the extent that competing products are not susceptible to the same vulnerabilities or if vulnerabilities can be more effectively mitigated in competing products moreover third parties can release information regarding potential vulnerabilities of our products before mitigations are available this in turn could lead to attempted or successful exploits adversely affect our ability to introduce mitigations or otherwise harm our business and reputation 

our business has suffered and could in the future suffer from manufacturing problems 

we manufacture in our own factories as well as with third parties our products using processes that are highly complex require advanced and costly equipment and must continuously be modified to improve yields and performance difficulties in the production process can reduce yields or interrupt production and as a result of such problems we may on occasion not be able to deliver products or do so in a timely or costeffective or competitive manner as the complexity of both our products and our fabrication processes has become more advanced manufacturing tolerances have been reduced and requirements for precision have become more demanding as is common in the semiconductor industry we have in the past experienced manufacturing difficulties that have given rise to delays in delivery and quality control problems there can be no assurance that any such occurrence in the future would not materially harm our results of operations further we may suffer disruptions in our manufacturing operations either due to production difficulties such as those described above or as a result of external factors beyond our control such as the disruption to our austin texas manufacturing facilities caused by the february 2021 winter storm we may in the future experience manufacturing difficulties or permanent or temporary loss of manufacturing capacity due to the preceding or other risks any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on the timely supply of equipment and materials and could suffer if suppliers fail to meet their delivery obligations or raise prices certain equipment and materials needed in our manufacturing operations are only available from a limited number of suppliers 

our manufacturing operations depend on deliveries of equipment and materials in a timely manner and in some cases on a justintime basis from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit the amounts supplied to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors supply disruptions may also occur due to shortages in critical materials such as silicon wafers or specialized chemicals because the equipment that 

we purchase is complex it is frequently difficult or impossible for us to substitute one piece of equipment for another or replace one type of material with another a failure by our suppliers to deliver our requirements could result in disruptions to our manufacturing operations our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of quality equipment or materials in a timely manner or if there are significant increases in the costs of equipment or materials 

failure of our third party suppliers to perform could adversely affect our results of operations 

we currently use outside suppliers for a portion of our manufacturing capacity outsourcing our production presents a number of risks if our outside suppliers are unable to satisfy our demand or experience manufacturing difficulties delays or reduced yields our results of operations and ability to satisfy customer demand could suffer in addition purchasing rather than manufacturing these products may adversely affect our gross profit margin if the purchase costs of these products are higher than our own manufacturing costs would have been prices for foundry products also vary depending on capacity utilization rates at our suppliers quantities demanded product technology and geometry furthermore these outsourcing costs can vary materially from quarter to quarter and in cases of industry shortages they can increase significantly negatively affecting our gross profit in addition we have entered into long term supply agreements with certain key manufacturing partners the failure of these suppliers to perform under these agreements or an unexpected reduction in demand for these products could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

disruptions in our relationships with any one of our key customers could adversely affect our business 

a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from our top customers including our distributors we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate similar levels of revenue from our largest customers in the future if one or more of these customers substantially reduce their purchases from us this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we receive subsidies and grants in certain countries and a reduction in the amount of governmental funding available to us or demands for repayment could increase our costs and affect our results of operations 

as is the case with other large semiconductor companies we receive subsidies and grants from governments in some countries these programs are subject to periodic review by the relevant governments and if any of these programs are curtailed or discontinued this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as the availability of government funding is outside our control we cannot guarantee that we will continue to benefit from government support or that sufficient alternative funding will be available if we lose such support moreover if we terminate any activities or operations including strategic alliances or joint ventures we may face adverse actions from the local governmental agencies providing such subsidies to us in particular such government agencies could seek to recover such subsidies from us and they could cancel or reduce other subsidies we receive from them this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

certain natural disasters such as flooding large earthquakes volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters may negatively impact our business there is increasing concern that climate change may cause a rising number of natural disasters 

environmental and other disasters such as flooding large earthquakes volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters or a combination thereof may negatively impact our business if flooding a large earthquake volcanic eruption or extreme weather event or other natural disaster were to directly damage destroy or disrupt our manufacturing facilities it could disrupt our operations delay new production and shipments of existing inventory or result in costly repairs replacements or other costs all of which would negatively impact our business even if our manufacturing facilities are not directly damaged a large natural disaster may result in disruptions in distribution channels supply chains movement of goods and significant increases in the prices of raw materials used for our manufacturing process for instance the nuclear incident following the tsunami in japan in 2011 impacted the supply chains of our customers and suppliers furthermore any disaster affecting our customers or their respective customers may significantly negatively impact the demand for our products and our revenues in addition climate change could cause certain natural disasters such as drought wildfires storms flooding or rising sea levels to occur more frequently or with greater intensity which could pose 

physical risks to our manufacturing or it facilities or our suppliers’ facilities or could disrupt the availability of water and utilities necessary for the operation of our manufacturing facilities or our suppliers’ facilities resulting in increased operating costs andor business disruption such as the disruption to our austin texas manufacturing facilities caused by the february 2021 winter storm and weatherrelated disruption of water and utilities to these facilities 

the impact of any such natural disasters depends on the specific geographic circumstances but could be significant as some of our factories are located in areas with known earthquake fault zones flood or storm risks including but not limited to singapore taiwan malaysia or thailand there is increasing concern that climate change is occurring that may cause a rising number of natural disasters with potentially dramatic effects on human activity we cannot predict the economic impact if any of natural disasters or climate change 

risks related to regulatory or legal challenges 

as our business is global we need to comply with laws and regulations in countries across the world 

we operate globally with manufacturing assembly and testing facilities in several continents and we market our products globally 

as a result we are subject to environmental data privacy labor and health and safety laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate we are also required to obtain environmental permits and other authorizations or licenses from governmental authorities for certain of our operations in the jurisdictions where we operate we need to comply with differing standards and varying practices of regulatory tax judicial and administrative bodies 

no assurance can be given that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with the laws and regulations to which we are subject or that we have obtained or will obtain the permits and other authorizations or licenses that we need if we violate or fail to comply with laws regulations permits and other authorizations or licenses we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators furthermore if one or more of our customers are sanctioned by regulators for noncompliance with laws and regulations we could experience a decrease in demand for our products for example import and export regulations such as the us export administration regulations administered by the us department of commerce are complex change frequently have generally become more stringent over time and have intensified in recent years our results of operations could be negatively impacted if are required to suspend activities with certain customers or suppliers due to future changes in regulations in 2020 due to regulations imposed by the us government we ceased shipments of our products to huawei pending approval of export licenses furthermore global privacy legislation enforcement and policy activity such as the eu general data privacy regulation are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment costs to comply with and implement these privacyrelated and data protection measures could be significant even our inadvertent failure to comply with applicable privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others 

legal proceedings covering a range of matters are pending in various jurisdictions due to the uncertainty inherent in litigation it is difficult to predict the final outcome an adverse outcome might affect our results of operations 

we and certain of our businesses are involved as plaintiffs or defendants in legal proceedings in various matters for example we are involved in legal proceedings claiming personal injuries to the children of former employees as a result of employees’ alleged exposure to chemicals used in semiconductor manufacturing clean room environments operated by us or our former parent companies philips and motorola furthermore because we continue to utilize these clean rooms we may become subject to future claims alleging personal injury that may lead to additional liability a judgment against us or material defense cost could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our manufacturing operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations and initiatives to address climate change 

we are subject to many environmental health and safety laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate which govern among other things emissions of pollutants into the air wastewater discharges the use and handling of hazardous substances waste disposal the investigation and remediation of soil and ground 

water contamination and the health and safety of our employees we are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws regulations and permits if we violate or fail to comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 

as with other companies engaged in similar activities or that own or operate real property we face inherent risks of environmental liability at our current and historical manufacturing facilities certain environmental laws impose strict and in certain circumstances joint and several liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substances as well as liability for related damages to natural resources certain of these laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated while we do not expect that any contamination currently known to us will have a material adverse effect on our business we cannot assure you that this is the case or that we will not discover new facts or conditions or that environmental laws or the enforcement of such laws will not change such that our liabilities would be increased significantly in addition we could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage in summary we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to regulated materials will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions and results of operations 

public and private initiatives to address climate change may result in an increase in the cost of production due to increase in the prices of energy introduction of energy or carbon tax or the purchase of carbon offsets a variety of regulatory developments have been introduced that focus on restricting or managing the emission of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases enterprises may need to purchase at higher costs new equipment or raw materials with lower carbon footprints environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment modify product designs or incur expenses new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may become subject to regulation these developments and further legislation that is likely to be enacted could affect our operations negatively changes in environmental regulations could increase our production and operational costs which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to cybersecurity and it systems 

interruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology applications systems and networks to operate our business the reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure and software and our ability to expand and continually update technologies in response to our changing needs is critical to our business any significant interruption in our business applications systems or networks including but not limited to new system implementations computer viruses cyberattacks security breaches facility issues or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our computer systems and networks are subject to attempted security breaches and other cybersecurity incidents which if successful could impact our business 

we have from time to time experienced cyberattacks attempting to obtain access to our computer systems and networks such incidents whether or not successful could result in the misappropriation of our proprietary information and technology the compromise of personal and confidential information of our employees customers or suppliers or interrupt our business there can be no assurance that a breach or incident will not have a material impact on our operations and financial results in the future in the current environment there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy including criminal hackers statesponsored intrusions industrial espionage employee malfeasance and human or technological error computer hackers and others routinely attempt to breach the security of technology products services and systems and those of customers suppliers and some of those attempts may be successful such breaches could result in for example unauthorized access to disclosure modification misuse loss or destruction of our our customer or other third party data or systems theft of sensitive or confidential data including personal information including personal data about our employees customers or other third parties and intellectual property system disruptions and 

denial of service in the event of such breaches we our customers or other third parties could be exposed to potential liability litigation and regulatory action as well as the loss of existing or potential customers damage to our reputation and other financial loss in addition the cost and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant as these threats continue to develop and grow we have been adapting our security measures and we continue to increase the amount we allocate to implement maintain andor update security systems to protect data and infrastructure as a global enterprise we could also be impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity privacy and data protection additionally cyberattacks or other catastrophic events resulting in disruptions to or failures in power information technology communication systems or other critical infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to us our customers or other third party operations or services financial loss potential liability and damage our reputation and affect our relationships with our customers and suppliers 

risks related to intellectual property 

we rely to a significant extent on proprietary intellectual property we may not be able to protect this intellectual property against improper use by our competitors or others 

our success and future revenue growth depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology our products our proprietary designs and fabrication processes and other intellectual property against misappropriation by others we primarily rely on patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our intellectual property we may have difficulty obtaining patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our proprietary products technology and intellectual property and the patents and other intellectual property rights we receive may be insufficient to provide us with meaningful protection or commercial advantage we may not obtain patent protection or secure other intellectual property rights in all the countries in which we operate and under the laws of such countries patents and other intellectual property rights may be or become unavailable or limited in scope even if new patents are issued the claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to effectively protect our proprietary technology processes and other intellectual property in addition any of our existing patents and any future patents issued to us may be challenged invalidated or circumvented the protection offered by intellectual property rights may be inadequate or weakened for reasons or circumstances that are out of our control further our proprietary technology designs and processes and other intellectual property may be vulnerable to disclosure or misappropriation by employees contractors and other persons it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain copy use or disclose our proprietary technologies our products designs processes and other intellectual property despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property while we hold a significant number of patents there can be no assurances that additional patents will be issued or that any rights granted under our patents will provide meaningful protection against misappropriation of our intellectual property our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents we may not have or pursue patents or pending applications in all the countries in which we operate corresponding to all of our primary patents and applications even if patents are granted effective enforcement in some countries may not be available in particular intellectual property rights are difficult to enforce in countries where the application and enforcement of the laws governing such rights may not have reached the same level as compared to other jurisdictions where we operate consequently operating in some countries may subject us to an increased risk that unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise use our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our suppliers or other parties with whom we engage there is no assurance that we will be able to protect our intellectual property rights or have adequate legal recourse in the event that we seek legal or judicial enforcement of our intellectual property rights under the laws of such countries any inability on our part to adequately protect our intellectual property may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may become party to intellectual property claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products 

we have from time to time received and may in the future receive communications alleging possible infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights of others further we may become involved in costly litigation brought against us regarding patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets or other intellectual property rights if any such claims are asserted against us we may seek to obtain a license under the third party’s intellectual property rights we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain any or all of the necessary 

licenses on satisfactory terms if at all in the event that we cannot obtain or take the view that we don’t need a license these parties may file lawsuits against us seeking damages and potentially treble damages in the united states or an injunction against the sale of our products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presently conducted such lawsuits if successful could result in an increase in the costs of selling certain of our products our having to partially or completely redesign our products or stop the sale of some of our products and could cause damage to our reputation any litigation could require significant financial and management resources regardless of the merits or outcome and we cannot assure you that we would prevail in any litigation or that our intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged the award of damages including material royalty payments or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products could affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to human capital management 

loss of our key management and other personnel or an inability to attract such management and other personnel could affect our business 

we depend on our key management to run our business and on our senior engineers to develop new products and technologies our success will depend on the continued service of these individuals although we have several share based compensation plans in place we cannot be sure that these plans will help us in our ability to retain key personnel especially considering that the stock options under some of our plans become exercisable upon a change of control in particular when a third party or third parties acting in concert obtains whether directly or indirectly control of us the loss of any of our key personnel whether due to departures death ill health or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business the market for qualified employees including skilled engineers and other individuals with the required technical expertise to succeed in our business is highly competitive and the loss of qualified employees or an inability to attract retain and motivate the additional highly skilled employees required for the operation and expansion of our business could hinder our ability to successfully conduct research activities or develop marketable products the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business 

risks related to our corporate structure 

united states civil liabilities may not be enforceable against us 

we are incorporated under the laws of the netherlands and substantial portions of our assets are located outside of the united states in addition certain members of our board our officers and certain experts named herein reside outside the united states as a result it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the united states upon us or such other persons residing outside the united states or to enforce outside the united states judgments obtained against such persons in us courts in any action in addition it may be difficult for investors to enforce in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the united states rights predicated upon the us laws 

in the absence of an applicable treaty for the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments other than arbitration awards in civil and commercial matters to which the united states and the netherlands are a party a judgment obtained against the company in the courts of the united states whether or not predicated solely upon the us federal securities laws including a judgment predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the us securities law or securities laws of any state or territory within the united states will not be directly enforceable in the netherlands 

in order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the netherlands the claim must be relitigated before a competent court of the netherlands the relevant netherlands court has discretion to attach such weight to a judgment of the courts of the united states as it deems appropriate based on case law the courts of the netherlands may be expected to recognize and grant permission for enforcement of a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction in the united states without reexamination or relitigation of the substantive matters adjudicated thereby provided that i the relevant court in the united states had jurisdiction in the matter in accordance with standards which are generally accepted internationally ii the proceedings before that court complied with principles of proper procedure iii recognition andor enforcement of that judgment does not conflict with the public policy of the netherlands and iv recognition andor enforcement of that judgment is 

not irreconcilable with a decision of a dutch court rendered between the same parties or with an earlier decision of a foreign court rendered between the same parties in a dispute that is about the same subject matter and that is based on the same cause provided that earlier decision can be recognized in the netherlands 

based on the foregoing there can be no assurance that us investors will be able to enforce against us or members of our board of directors officers or certain experts named herein who are residents of the netherlands or countries other than the united states any judgments obtained in us courts in civil and commercial matters 

in addition there is doubt as to whether a dutch court would impose civil liability on us the members of our board of directors our officers or certain experts named herein in an original action predicated solely upon the us laws brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in the netherlands against us or such members officers or experts respectively 

we are a dutch public company with limited liability the rights of our stockholders may be different from the rights of stockholders governed by the laws of us jurisdictions 

we are a dutch public company with limited liability naamloze vennootschap  our corporate affairs are governed by our articles of association and by the laws governing companies incorporated in the netherlands the rights of stockholders and the responsibilities of members of our board of directors may be different from the rights and obligations of stockholders in companies governed by the laws of us jurisdictions in the performance of its duties our board of directors is required by dutch law to consider the interests of our company its stockholders its employees and other stakeholders in all cases with due observation of the principles of reasonableness and fairness it is possible that some of these parties will have interests that are different from or in addition to your interests as a stockholder see part iii item 10 directors executive officers and corporate governance  

risks related to our indebtedness 

our debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our financial condition which could adversely affect our results of operations 

as of december 31 2021 we had outstanding indebtedness with an aggregate principal amount of 10650 million our substantial indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business by 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic industry or competitive developments 

• requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations capital expenditures and future business opportunities 

• exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates in the event we have borrowings under our 1500 million revolving credit facility agreement the “rcf agreement” because loans under the rcf agreement bear interest at a variable rate 

• making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and any failure to comply with the obligations of any our debt instruments including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions could result in an event default under the indentures governing our notes and agreements governing other indebtedness 

• restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financial for working capital capital expenditures restructurings product development research and development debt service requirements investments acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes and 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who therefore may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting 

despite our level of indebtedness we may still incur significantly more debt which could further exacerbate the risks described above and affect our ability to service and repay our debt 

if we do not comply with the covenants in our debt agreements or fail to generate sufficient cash to service and repay our debt it could adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition 

the rcf agreement and the indentures governing our unsecured notes or any other debt arrangements that we may have require us to comply with various covenants if there were an event of default under any of our debt instruments that was not cured or waived the holders of the defaulted debt could terminate commitments to lend and cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt to be due and payable immediately which in turn could result in cross defaults under our other debt instruments our assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under all of our outstanding debt instruments if some or all of these instruments are accelerated upon an event of default 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets seek additional capital restructure or refinance our indebtedness or reduce or delay capital expenditures strategic acquisitions investments and alliances any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt and fund our planned capital expenditures and business plan our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives in addition any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations 

the rating of our debt by major rating agencies may further improve or deteriorate which could affect our additional borrowing capacity and financing costs 

the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt these ratings are based on current information furnished to the ratings agencies by us and information obtained by the ratings agencies from other sources an explanation of the significance of such rating may be obtained from such rating agency there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in each rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade could affect our market value andor increase our corporate borrowing costs 

general risk factors 

we identified a material weakness in our internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls which if not remediated appropriately or timely could result in loss of investor confidence and adversely impact our stock price 

as disclosed in part ii item 9a management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december 31 2021 due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting associated with ineffective information technology general controls itgcs in the areas of user access changemanagement and it operations over certain information technology it systems that support the company’s financial reporting processes 

we have initiated remediation plans to address the material weakness including but not limited to expanding controls applying other appropriate procedures to address the design and operation of internal controls relating to certain it systems and enhancing procedures for the identification of control activities and monitoring of control performance to ensure that the components of internal control relating to certain it systems are present and functioning while there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful in fiscal year 2022 we intend to fully implement these plans to remediate the material weaknesses 

if we are unable to remediate the material weakness or are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures our ability to record process and report financial information accurately and to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and 

payment of legal and other expenses negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price 

the price of our common stock historically has been volatile the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly 

the stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies the market price for our common stock has varied between a high of 23991 on december 7 2021 and a low of 15602 on january 27 2021 in the twelvemonth period ending on december 31 2021 the market price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations for many reasons including in response to the risks described in this section changes in our dividend or share repurchase policies variations between our actual financial results or guidance and expectations of securities analysts or investors or for reasons unrelated to our operations such as reports by industry analysts investor perceptions or negative announcements by our customers competitors peer companies or suppliers regarding their own performance or announcements by our competitors of significant contracts strategic partnerships joint ventures joint marketing relationships or capital commitments the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments affecting us or our industry as well as industry conditions and general financial economic and political instability in the past following periods of market volatility shareholders have instituted securities class action litigation if we were involved in securities litigation it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of executive management from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation 

we may have fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases 

the amount timing and execution of our stock repurchases may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes—such as investing in our business including operational spending capital spending and acquisitions and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments—and because of changes in cash flows tax laws and the market price of our common stock 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends 

our board of directors has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we currently pay a cash dividend on our ordinary shares on a quarterly basis the declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the approval of our board and our dividend may be discontinued or reduced at any time there can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends in the future in any particular amounts or at all 

future dividends if any and their timing and amount may be affected by among other factors management’s views on potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions including acquisitions earnings levels contractual restrictions cash position and overall financial condition and changes to our business model the payment of cash dividends is restricted by applicable law contractual restrictions and our corporate structure 

the impact of a negative performance of financial markets and demographic trends on our defined benefit pension liabilities and costs cannot be predicted 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans in a number of countries and a significant number of our employees are covered by our defined benefit pension plans as of december 31 2021 we had recognized a net accrued benefit liability of 508 million representing the unfunded benefit obligations of our defined pension plans the funding status and the liabilities and costs of maintaining these defined benefit pension plans may be impacted by financial market developments for example the accounting for such plans requires determining discount rates expected rates of compensation and expected returns on plan assets and any changes in these variables can have a significant impact on the projected benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs negative performance of the financial markets could also have a material impact on funding requirements and net periodic pension costs our defined benefit pension plans may also be subject to demographic trends accordingly our costs to meet pension liabilities going forward may be significantly higher than they are today which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 

future changes to dutch us and other foreign tax laws could adversely affect us 

the european commission us congress and treasury department the organization for economic cooperation and development and other government agencies in jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations particularly payments made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates as a result the tax laws in the european union us and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could adversely affect us and our affiliates 

recent examples include the organization for economic cooperation and development’s initiatives to revise profit allocation and nexus rules to allocate more taxing rights to countries where companies have their markets and to establish a minimum tax rate on a global basis these initiatives include recommendations and proposals that if enacted in countries in which we and our affiliates do business could adversely affect us and our affiliates 

we are exposed to a number of different tax uncertainties which could have an impact on our results 

we are required to pay taxes in multiple jurisdictions we determine the taxes we are required to pay based on our interpretation of the applicable tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we may be subject to unfavorable changes in the respective tax laws and regulations to which we are subject tax controls audits change in controls and changes in tax laws or regulations or the interpretation given to them may expose us to negative tax consequences including interest payments and potentially penalties we have issued transferpricing directives in the areas of goods services and financing which are in accordance with the guidelines of the organization of economic cooperation and development oecd as transfer pricing has a cross border effect the focus of local tax authorities on implemented transfer pricing procedures in a country may have an impact on results in another country 

transfer pricing uncertainties can also result from disputes with local tax authorities about transfer pricing of internal deliveries of goods and services or related to financing acquisitions and divestments the use of tax credits and permanent establishments and tax losses carried forward these uncertainties may have a significant impact on local tax results we also have various tax assets resulting from acquisitions tax assets can also result from the generation of tax losses in certain legal entities tax authorities may challenge these tax assets in addition the value of the tax assets resulting from tax losses carried forward depends on having sufficient taxable profits in the future 

in 2021 the united states proposed a budget reconciliation act that could amend the internal revenue code the “build back better act” the build back better proposal contains provisions affecting the tax treatment of both us companies such as certain of our subsidiaries and nonus companies that could materially affect us the build back better proposal includes provisions that impose a minimum tax of 15 on adjusted financial statement net income extends through the end of 2025 set to expire on december 31 2021 the expensing of research and experimental costs and modifies us inbound and outbound international provisions – including the global intangible lowtaxed income gilti on foreign earnings made by us corporations’ foreign subsidiaries the deduction for certain foreignderived intangible income fdii and the base erosion and antiabuse tax beat levied on otherwise deductible payments made to certain foreign affiliates although not yet passed and not yet signed into law the effective date for the provisions could range from january 1 2022 to january 1 2023

overview 



revenue for 2021 was 11063 million as compared to the 8612 million reported in 2020 an increase of 2451 million or an increase of 285 yearonyear as a result of resurgent growth across all of the company’s four focus end markets with substantial growth in our strategic focused automotive and industrial  iot end markets the growth nxp experienced in 2021 was due to a combination of rebounding end market demand from the initial shock and widespread market disruption caused by the emergence of the covid19 pandemic in the first half of 2020 and accelerating adoption of the company’s innovative new products and solutions the yearonyear growth was due to higher unit volumes as well as a higher average selling prices resulting from increases in input costs from nxp’s supplier base which were passed onto our customers the growth nxp experienced in 2021 began to clearly emerge at the end of the third quarter of 2020 and has continued to steadily accelerate through the fourth quarter of 2021 even with the strong growth experienced in 2021 the company believes customer demand will continue to outpace material supply resulting in another positive year of growth into 2022 

our gross profit percentage for 2021 increased to 548 from 492 primarily due to the significant acceleration of revenue during the second half of 2021 after the drop of sales in 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic which led to improved utilization cost reductions and efficiencies partly offset by higher personnelrelated costs 

revenue for the fourth quarter which ended december 31 2021 was 3039 million as compared to 2507 million for the fourth quarter ended december 31 2020 an increase of 532 million or an increase of 212 revenue 

in the fourth quarter of 2021 represented a historical record for nxp the result of strong demand in a supply constrained market which was consistent with the trends seen in the first three quarters of 2021 

we continue to generate strong operating cash flows with 3077 million in cash flows from operations for 2021 we returned 4577 million to our shareholders during the year in dividends and repurchases of common stock our cash position at the end of 2021 was 2830 million on november 18 2021 the nxp board of directors approved a cash dividend of 05625 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2021 

our global communities continue to face unprecedented challenges posed by the covid19 pandemic but nxp has continued to actively respond by addressing the covid19 situation and its impact globally with global crisis response teams working to mitigate the potential impacts to our people and our business with our strong business model and with demonstrated financial discipline which is a keystone of our culture we continue to believe that we will emerge from this time well positioned for longterm growth as we continue to see strong customer interest in the breadth of our product portfolio combined with solid design win awards however we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of the pandemic or its ultimate impact on the global economy and our business and results 

demand has come back more rapidly than we expected and our current focus is on looking after our customers and ensuring we ship as much product to them as possible while we are encouraged by the rapid rebound in demand we are still challenged by the impact of the global pandemic including supply chain constraints and covid outbreaks and resulting government responses in areas in which we operate we are still of the view that the best course of action is to continue to focus on enabling our customers success while simultaneously assuring the safety and health of all of our employees 

results of operations 

the following table presents the composition of operating income for the years ended december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 



revenue 

revenue for the yearended december 31 2021 was 11063 million compared to 8612 million for the yearended december 31 2020 an increase of 2451 million or 285 yearonyear as a result of resurgent growth across all of the companys four focus end markets with substantial growth in our strategic focused automotive and industrial end markets 

revenue by end market was as follows 



revenue by sales channel was as follows 



revenue by geographic region which is based on the customer’s shippedto location was as follows 





revenue in the automotive end market was 5493 million an increase of 436 versus the year ago period due to a significant increase in demand for nxp’s embedded automotive processing solutions including solutions to address the shift toward domain and zonal processing additionally customer adoption of nxps radar products for adas safety products and a rebound in demand for advanced analog products including demand for solutions to enable electric vehicle power trains contributed to the strong yearonyear growth from a channel perspective nxp’s distribution partners in greater china and asia pacific the americas and japan were responsible for the majority of the yearonyear growth though the company experienced solid growth from direct oemems customers across all geographic regions 

revenue in the industrial  iot end market was 2410 million an increase of 313 versus the year ago period primarily due to strong demand for nxp’s embedded processing solutions especially industrial application processors and next generation crossover processors additionally nxp experienced positive yearonyear trends within our advanced analog and connectivity solutions from a channel perspective nxp’s distribution channel partners in the greater china and asia pacific region enabled nxp to service demands of the longtail of industrial  iot customers 

revenue in the mobile end market was 1412 million an increase of 131 versus the year ago period due to continued demands for nxps unique secure mobile wallet solutions as well as early ramps of the company’s ultrawide band uwb solutions and continued adoption of mobile embedded power products offset by declines in custom interface from a channel perspective nxp’s distribution partners in greater china and asia pacific facilitated the yearonyear growth servicing the concentrated mobile manufacturing centers in asia 

revenue in the communication infrastructure  other end market was 1748 million an increase of 26 versus the year ago period due to a combination of secure tagging and smart transit products as well as strength from rf power products levered to the secular buildout of 5g base stations offset by declines in legacy multicore processing solutions from a channel perspective nxp’s distribution partners in greater china and asia pacific facilitated the yearonyear growth 

gross profit 

gross profit for the yearended december 31 2021 was 6067 million or 548 of revenue compared to 4235 million or 492 of revenue for the yearended december 31 2020 the increase of 1832 million was primarily driven by the significantly higher revenue in 2021 compared to 2020 resulting from accelerating demand and as such improved loading and manufacturing efficiencies offset by higher personnelrelated cost including variable compensation cost and a less favorable product mix as a result the gross margin percentage increased to 548 from 492 

operating expenses 

operating expenses for the yearended december 31 2021 totaled 3484 million or 315 of revenue compared to 3931 million or 456 of revenue for the yearended december 31 2020 

the following table below presents the composition of operating expenses by line item in the statement of operations 





the decrease in operating expenses was a result of the following items 

research and development rd costs primarily consist of engineer salaries and wages including share based compensation and other variable compensation engineering related costs including outside services fixedasset ip and other licenses related costs shared service center costs and other preproduction related expenses 

• rd costs for the yearended december 31 2021 increased by 211 million or 122 when compared to last year driven by 

 personnelrelated costs including variable compensation costs and 

 lower restructuring cost due to the absence of restructurings in 2021 

selling general and administrative sga costs primarily consist of personnel salaries and wages including share based compensation and other variable compensation communication and it related costs fixedasset related costs and sales and marketing costs including travel expenses 

• sga costs for the yearended december 31 2021 increased by 77 million or 88 when compared to last year mainly due to 

 higher personnelrelated costs including variable compensation costs 

 higher legal expense 

 lower sharebased compensation expenses as a result of the ceo transition in 2020 and 

 lower restructuring costs due to the absence of restructuring in 2021 

• amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets decreased by 735 million or 554 when compared to last year driven by 

 certain intangibles became fully amortized during 2020 

 an impairment charge in 2020 relative to iprd acquired as part of the acquisition of freescale and 

 an impairment charge in 2021 as a result of the discontinuation of an iprd project 

other income expense 

income and expenses derived from manufacturing service arrangements “msa” and transitional service arrangements “tsa” that are put into place when we divest a business or activity are included in other income expense these arrangements are expected to decrease as the divested business or activity becomes more established 

the following table presents the split of other income expense for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 



other income expense reflects nil for 2021 compared to 114 million of income in 2020 included in 2020 is 110 million relating to the net gain on the sale of the voice and audio solutions vas assets 

financial income expense 



financial income expense was an expense of 403 million in 2021 compared to an expense of 417 million in 2020 the change in financial income expense is primarily attributable to foreign exchange results which resulted in a profit of 5 million in 2021 versus a loss of 16 million in 2020 and lower debt extinguishment costs in 2021 versus 2020 of 38 million this was partially offset by lower interest income of 9 million as a result of lower interest rates an increase of interest expense of 7 million and a change in miscellaneous financial incomeexpense of 29 million mainly driven by a loss of 2 million on investments in 2021 where 2020 resulted in a profit of 24 million 

benefit provision for income taxes 

we recorded an income tax expense of 272 million for the yearended december 31 2021 which reflects an effective tax rate of 125 compared to a benefit of 83 million 83000 for the yearended december 31 2020 



the effective tax rate reflects the impact of tax incentives a portion of our earnings being taxed in foreign jurisdictions at rates different than the netherlands statutory tax rate changes in estimates of prior years income taxes change in valuation allowance and nondeductible expenses sale of nondeductible goodwill and withholding taxes the impact of these items results in offsetting factors that attribute to the change in the effective tax rate between the two periods with the significant drivers outlined below 

• the company benefits from certain tax incentives which reduce the effective tax rate the dollar amount of the incentive in any given year is commensurate with the taxable income in that same period for 2021 the foreign tax and netherlands tax incentives were higher than 2020 by 67 million mainly due to the fact that nxp increased its investment expenditures and benefited from higher qualifying income 

• the difference in valuation allowance in 2021 as compared with 2020 is mainly due to the fact that the netherlands released its valuation allowance related to carried forward interest expenses impacted by the interest limitation rules as a result of higher qualifying income 

• the difference in withholding taxes is mainly due to changes in the applicable deferred tax liability rate regarding future remittances of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries in 2020 

• the tax effect of the nondeductible goodwill of 10 million is linked to the divestiture of the vas business in 2020 

results relating to equityaccounted investees 

results relating to equityaccounted investees amounted to a loss of 2 million in 2021 whereas in 2020 results relating to equityaccounted investees amounted to a loss of 4 million 

noncontrolling interests 

noncontrolling interests are related to the thirdparty share in the results of consolidated companies predominantly ssmc their share of noncontrolling interests amounted to a profit of 35 million for the yearended december 31 2021 compared to a profit of 28 million for the yearended december 31 2020 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

we derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from our cash flows from operations we continue to generate strong positive operating cash flows and we currently use cash to fund operations meet working capital requirements for capital expenditures and for potential common stock repurchases dividends and strategic investments based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our current available sources of funds including cash and cash equivalents rcf agreement plus anticipated cash generated from operations will be adequate to finance our operations working capital requirements capital expenditures and potential dividends for at least the next year 

cash 

as of december 31 2021 our cash balance was 2830 million an increase of 555 million compared to december 31 2020 2275 million of which 208 million 2020 185 million was held by ssmc our consolidated joint venture company with tsmc under the terms of our joint venture agreement with tsmc a portion of this cash can be distributed by way of a dividend to us but 388 of the dividend will be paid to our joint venture partner during 2021 no dividend 2020 90 million was declared taking into account the available undrawn amount of the rcf agreement of 1500 million we had access to 4330 million of liquidity as of december 31 2021

additional capital requirements 

we believe our current cash and cash equivalents position our expected cash flow generated from operations and our expected financing activities will satisfy our working and other capital requirements for at least the next 12 months based on our current business plans recent and expected working and other capital requirements in addition to the above matters also include the items described below 

• the company maintains purchase commitments with certain suppliers primarily for raw materials semifinished goods and manufacturing services and for some nonproduction items purchase commitments for inventory materials are generally restricted to a forecasted timehorizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties this forecasted timehorizon can vary for different suppliers as of december 31 2021 the company had purchase commitments of 4354 million of which 1377 million is expected to be paid in the next 12 months we expect an increase in operating cash outflows as compared to 2021 as we make payments under these purchase commitments 

• amounts related to future lease payments for operating lease obligations at december 31 2021 totaled 256 million with 60 million expected to be paid within the next 12 months

the change in operating assets and liabilities was attributable to the following 

the 176 million increase in receivables and other current assets was primarily due to the increase in trade accounts receivable net which was driven by the increasing linearity of revenue between the two periods customer mix and the related timing of cash collections in 2021 compared with the same period in 2020 

the 159 million increase in inventories was primarily related to increased production levels in order to attempt to align inventory on hand with the current revenue forecasts

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with us gaap requires our management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated 

financial statements and the accompanying notes our management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience current economic and industry conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain our most critical accounting estimates include 

• the valuation of inventory which impacts gross margin 

• the assessment of recoverability of goodwill identified intangible assets and tangible fixed assets which impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization 

• revenue recognition which impacts our results of operations 

• the recognition of current and deferred income taxes including the measurement of uncertain tax positions which impacts our provision for income taxes 

• the assumptions used in the determination of postretirement benefit obligations which impacts operating expenses 

• the assumptions used in the determination of share based compensation which impacts gross margin and operating expenses and 

• the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies which impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we recognize a loss contingency or revise the estimates for a loss contingency 

in the following section we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved 

inventories 

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value we regularly review our inventories and write down our inventories for estimated losses due to obsolescence this allowance is determined for groups of products based on sales of our products in the recent past andor expected future demand future demand is affected by market conditions technological obsolescence new products and strategic plans each of which is subject to change with little or no forewarning in estimating obsolescence we utilize information that includes projecting future demand 

the need for strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive delivery performance to our customers are balanced against the risk of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 

the change in our reserves for inventories was primarily due to the normal review and accrual of obsolete or excess inventory if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by our management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

goodwill 

goodwill is required to be assessed for impairment at least once annually or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist which includes evaluating qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment of a reporting unit’s goodwill such events or changes in circumstances can be significant changes in business climate operating performance or competition or upon the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred between annual test dates we perform impairment tests using a fair value approach when necessary determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital and future economic and market conditions we base our fairvalue estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable actual cash flow amounts for future periods may differ from estimates used in impairment testing 

we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year we did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in the years presented as our annual impairment testing indicated that the fair value exceeded the recorded value for the respective reporting unit 

impairment or disposal of identified longlived assets 

we perform reviews of longlived assets including property plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than what we had originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable if such facts and circumstances exist we assess the recoverability of the longlived assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts in the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the assets or based on appraisals impairment losses if any are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets longlived assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or their estimated fair values less costs to sell and are not depreciated 

the assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other longlived assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by various factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines in 2021 we recognized impairment charges of 36 million as a result of the discontinuation of an iprd project in 2020 we recognized impairment charges of 36 million relative to iprd that was acquired from freescale in 2019 we had no impairments 

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenue under the core principle to depict the transfer of control to customers in an amount reflecting the consideration the company expects to be entitled in order to achieve that core principle the company applies the following five step approach 1 identify the contract with a customer 2 identify the performance obligations in the contract 3 determine the transaction price 4 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied 

the vast majority of the company’s revenue is derived from the sale of semiconductor products to distributors original equipment manufacturers “oems” and similar customers in determining the transaction price the company evaluates whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled variable consideration is estimated and includes the impact of discounts price protection product returns and distributor incentive programs the estimate of variable consideration is dependent on a variety of factors including contractual terms analysis of historical data current economic conditions industry demand and both the current and forecasted pricing environments the estimate of variable consideration is not constrained because the company has extensive experience with these contracts 

revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer ie when the company’s performance obligation is satisfied which typically occurs at shipment in determining whether control has transferred the company considers if there is a present right to payment and legal title and whether risks and rewards of ownership having transferred to the customer 

for sales to distributors revenue is recognized upon transfer of control to the distributor for some distributors contractual arrangements are in place which allow these distributors to return products if certain conditions are met these conditions generally relate to the time period during which a return is allowed and reflect customary conditions in the particular geographic market other return conditions relate to circumstances arising at the end of a product life cycle when certain distributors are permitted to return products purchased during a predefined period after the company has announced a product’s pending discontinuance these return rights are a form of variable consideration and are estimated using the most likely method based on historical return rates in order to reduce revenues recognized however long notice periods associated with these announcements prevent significant amounts of product from being returned for sales where return rights exist the company has determined based on historical data that only a very small percentage of the sales of this type to distributors is actually returned repurchase agreements with oems or distributors are not entered into by the company 

sales to most distributors are made under programs common in the semiconductor industry whereby distributors receive certain price adjustments to meet individual competitive opportunities these programs may include credits granted to distributors or allow distributors to return or scrap a limited amount of product in accordance with contractual terms agreed upon with the distributor or receive price protection credits when our standard published prices are lowered from the price the distributor paid for product still in its inventory in determining the transaction price the company considers the price adjustments from these programs to be variable consideration that reduce the amount of revenue recognized the company’s policy is to estimate such price adjustments using the most likely method based on rolling historical experience rates as well as a prospective view of products and pricing in the distribution channel for distributors who participate in our volume rebate incentive program we continually monitor the actual claimed allowances against our estimates and we adjust our estimates as appropriate to reflect trends in pricing environments and inventory levels the estimates are also adjusted when recent historical data does not represent anticipated future activity historically actual price adjustments for these programs relative to those estimated have not materially differed 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based upon the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled deferred tax liabilities for withholding taxes on dividends from subsidiaries are recognized in situations where the company does not consider the earnings indefinitely reinvested and to the extent that these withholding taxes are not expected to be refundable 

deferred tax assets including assets arising from loss carryforwards are recognized net of a valuation allowance if based upon the available evidence it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized 

the income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities the income tax benefit recognized is measured based on the largest benefit that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon resolution of the uncertainty unrecognized tax benefits are presented as a reduction to the deferred tax asset for related net operating loss carryforwards unless these would not be available in which case the uncertain tax benefits are presented together with the related interest and penalties as a liability under accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities based on the timing of the expected payment penalties are recorded as income tax expense whereas interest is reported as financial expense in the statement of operations 

postretirement benefits 

the company’s employees participate in pension and other postretirement benefit plans in many countries the costs of pension and other postretirement benefits and related assets and liabilities with respect to the company’s employees participating in definedbenefit plans are based upon actuarial valuations 

the projected definedbenefit obligation is calculated annually by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method for the company’s major plans the discount rate is derived from market yields on high quality corporate bonds plans in countries without a deep corporate bond market use a discount rate based on the local government bond rates 

in calculating obligation and expense the company is required to select actuarial assumptions these assumptions include discount rate expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation costs determined based on current market conditions historical information and consultation with and input from our actuaries changes in the key assumptions can have a significant impact to the projected benefit obligations funding requirements and periodic pension cost incurred 

the company determines the fair value of plan assets based on quoted prices or comparable prices for nonquoted assets for a definedbenefit pension plan the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation for any other postretirement defined benefit plan it is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 

sharebased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for all sharebased awards based on the grantdate estimated fair values net of an estimated forfeiture rate we use the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the estimated fair value for certain awards sharebased compensation cost for restricted share units “rsus” with timebased vesting is measured based on the closing fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant reduced by the present value of the estimated expected future dividends and then multiplied by the number of rsus granted sharebased compensation cost for performancebased share units “psus” granted with performance or market conditions is measured using a monte carlo simulation model on the date of grant 

our valuation models and generally accepted valuation techniques require us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards these assumptions and judgments include estimating the volatility of our stock price expected dividend yield employee turnover rates and employee stock option exercise behaviors when establishing the expected life assumption we used the ‘simplified’ method prescribed in asc topic 718 for companies that do not have adequate historical data the riskfree interest rate is measured as the prevailing yield for a us treasury security with a maturity similar to the expected life assumption we also estimate a forfeiture rate at the time of grant and revise this rate in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures or vesting differ from the original estimates 

we evaluate the assumptions used to value our awards on a quarterly basis if factors change and we employ different assumptions sharebased compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past if there are any modifications or cancellation of the underlying unvested securities we may be required to accelerate increase or cancel any remaining unearned sharebased compensation expense 

litigation and claims 

we are regularly involved as plaintiffs or defendants in claims and litigation related to our past and current business operations the claims can cover a broad range of topics including intellectual property reflecting the company’s identity as a global manufacturing and technology business the company vigorously defends itself against improper claims including those asserted in litigation due to the unpredictable nature of litigation there can be no assurance that the company’s accruals will be sufficient to cover the extent of its potential exposure to losses but historically legal actions have not had a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations or financial condition 

the estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is based on currently available information in relation to the claims that have arisen and on the company’s best estimate of such losses for those cases for which such estimate can be made for certain claims the company believes that an estimate cannot currently be made the estimated aggregate range requires significant judgment given the varying stages of the proceedings including the fact that many of them are currently in preliminary stages the existence of multiple defendants including the company in such claims whose share of liability has yet to be determined the numerous yetunresolved issues in many of the claims and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such claims accordingly the company’s estimate will change from time to time and actual losses may be more than the current estimate 

use of certain nongaap financial measures 

in addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with us gaap this document contains references to net debt net debt is a nongaap financial measure and represents total debt shortterm and longterm after deduction of cash and cash equivalents we believe this measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allows for greater transparency with respect to calculating our net leverage 

the following is a reconciliation of net debt to the most directly comparable gaap measure total debt as adjusted for our cash and cash equivalents our net debt was calculated as follows 



we understand that although net debt is used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluation of companies this concept has limitations as an analytical tool and it should not be used as an alternative to any other measure in accordance with us gaap 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates because we finance certain operations through fixed and variable rate debt instruments and denominate our transactions in a variety of foreign currencies changes in these rates may have an impact on future cash flow and earnings we manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

by using derivative instruments we are subject to credit and market risk the fair market value of the derivative instruments is determined by using valuation models whose inputs are derived using market observable inputs including interest rate yield curves as well as foreign exchange and commodity spot and forward rates and reflects the asset or liability position as of the end of each reporting period when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive the counterparty owes us thus creating a receivable risk for us we are exposed to counterparty credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our derivative agreements we minimize counterparty credit or repayment risk by entering into transactions with major financial institutions of investment grade credit rating our exposure to market risk is not hedged in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings or cash flow 

interest rate risk 

our rcf agreement has a 1500 million borrowing capacity with a floating rate interest as there are currently no borrowings under this facility a hypothetical increase in libor based interest rates would not have caused any change to our interest expense on our floating rate debt

 item 9a controls and procedures 

disclosure controls and procedures 

as of the end of the period covered by this annual report our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer conducted an evaluation pursuant to rule 13a15e and 15d15e of the exchange act of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this annual report the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f of the exchange act the company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance not absolute assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements moreover projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

our management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2021 based on the criteria established in “ internal control  integrated framework 2013 ” by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso 

a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

the company’s management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting associated with ineffective information technology general controls itgcs in the areas of user access changemanagement and it operations over certain information technology it systems that support the company’s financial reporting processes management also deemed ineffective our automated and manual business process controls that are dependent on the affected itgcs because they could have been adversely impacted to the extent that they rely upon information and configurations from the affected it systems we believe that these control deficiencies were a result of it control processes lacking sufficient documentation such that the successful operation of itgcs was overly dependent upon knowledge and actions of certain individuals for each applicable it system insufficient training of it personnel on the importance of itgcs and riskassessment processes being inadequate to identify and assess risks in it environments that could impact internal control over financial reporting the material weakness did not result in any identified misstatements to the financial statements and there were no changes to previously released financial results however the deficiencies in it general controls created a more than remote possibility that a material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis based on this material weakness our management concluded that as of december 31 2021 the company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective 

management has analyzed the material weaknesses and performed additional analysis and procedures in preparing our consolidated financial statements we have concluded that our consolidated financial statements fairly present in all material respects our financial condition results of operations and cash flows at and for the periods presented apart from the material weaknesses described above nxp’s management has not identified any other deficiencies 

the company’s independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young accountants llp has issued an adverse audit report on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2021 which appears in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

remediation 

management has been implementing and continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated such that these controls are designed implemented and operating effectively these remediation actions are ongoing and include or are expected to include 

– expanding controls andor applying other appropriate procedures to address the design and operation of itgcs on systems supporting our financial processes 

– creating and filling functions with an emphasis on it compliance and oversight 

– developing a training program addressing itgcs and policies including educating control owners concerning the principles and requirements of each control with a focus on those related to user access and changemanagement over it systems impacting financial reporting 

– developing and maintaining policy documentation underlying itgcs to promote knowledge transfer upon personnel and function changes 

– developing enhanced risk assessment and control identification procedures 

– implementing an it management review and testing plan to monitor itgcs with a specific focus on systems supporting our financial reporting processes 

– enhanced quarterly reporting on the remediation measures to the audit committee of the board of directors 

as we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting we may decide to take additional measures to address control deficiencies or modify the remediation plans described above we believe that these actions will remediate the material weakness however the weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded through testing that these controls are operating effectively management believes the foregoing plans will effectively remediate the deficiencies constituting the material weaknesses and intends the remediation of this material weakness to be completed prior to the end of fiscal 2022 however there is no assurance as to when such remediation will be completed as the remediation plans are or continue to be implemented management may take additional measures or modify the plan elements described above 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

it should be noted that any control system regardless of how well it is designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that its objectives will be met because of inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements in addition controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions regardless of how remote 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

except for the material weakness identified during the quarter as of december 31 2021 there were no other changes in the companys internal control over financial reporting during the three and twelve month periods ended december 31 2021 which were identified in connection with managements evaluation required by paragraph d of rules 13a15 and 15d15 under the exchange act that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

manufacturing 

we manufacture integrated circuits and discrete semiconductors through a combination of wholly owned manufacturing facilities a manufacturing facility operated jointly with another semiconductor company and thirdparty foundries and assembly and test subcontractors we manage our manufacturing assets together through one centralized organization to ensure we realize scale benefits in asset utilization purchasing volumes and overhead leverage across businesses 

in the future we expect to outsource an increased part of our internal demand for wafer foundry and packaging services to thirdparty manufacturing sources in order to increase our flexibility to accommodate increased demand 

the manufacturing of a semiconductor involves several phases of production which can be broadly divided into “frontend” and “backend” processes frontend processes take place at highly complex wafer manufacturing facilities called fabrication plants or “wafer fabs” and involve the imprinting of substrate silicon wafers with the precise circuitry required for semiconductors to function the frontend production cycle requires high levels of precision and involves as many as 300 process steps backend processes involve the assembly test and packaging of semiconductors in a form suitable for distribution in contrast to the highly complex frontend process backend processing is generally less complicated and as a result we tend to determine the location of our backend facilities based more on cost factors than on technical considerations 

we primarily focus our internal and joint venture wafer manufacturing operations on running proprietary specialty process technologies that enable us to differentiate our products on key performance features and we generally outsource wafer manufacturing in process technologies that are available at thirdparty wafer foundries when it is economical to do so in addition we increasingly focus our inhouse manufacturing on our competitive 8inch wafer facilities which predominantly run manufacturing processes in the 140 nanometer 180 nanometer and 250 nanometer process nodes this focus increases our return on invested capital and reduces capital expenditures 

our frontend manufacturing facilities use a broad range of production processes and proprietary design methods including complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos bipolar bipolar cmos bicmos and doublediffused metal on silicon oxide semiconductor dmos technologies our wafer fabs produce semiconductors with line widths ranging from 90 nanometers to 3 microns for integrated circuits and 05 microns to greater than 4 microns for discretes this broad technology portfolio enables us to meet increasing demand from customers for system solutions which require a variety of technologies 

our backend manufacturing facilities test and package many different types of products using a wide variety of processes to optimize flexibility we use shared technology platforms for our backend assembly operations most of our assembly and test activities are maintained inhouse 

the following table shows selected key information with respect to our major frontend and backend facilities 



1 joint venture with tsmc we are entitled to 60 of the joint venture’s annual capacity 

we use a large number of raw materials in our front and backend manufacturing processes including silicon wafers chemicals gases lead frames substrates molding compounds and various types of precious and other metals our most important raw materials are the raw or substrate silicon wafers we use to make our semiconductors we purchase these wafers which must meet exacting specifications from a limited number of suppliers in the geographic region in which our fabrication facilities are located at our wholly owned fabrication plants we use raw wafers ranging from 6 inches to 8 inches in size our ssmc wafer fab facility which produces 8 inch wafers is jointly owned by tsmc and ourselves emerging fabrication technologies employ larger wafer sizes and accordingly we expect that our production requirements will in the future shift towards larger substrate wafers 

we typically source our other raw materials in a similar fashion as our wafers although our portfolio of suppliers is more diverse some of our suppliers provide us with materials on a justintime basis which permits us to reduce our procurement costs and the negative cash flow consequences of maintaining inventories but exposes us to potential supply chain interruptions we purchase most of our raw materials on the basis of fixed price contracts but generally do not commit ourselves to longterm purchase obligations which permits us to renegotiate prices periodically 

due to the covid19 pandemic semiconductor supply chains have been under more pressure as a result there has been a tendency towards longer term contracts with suppliers in exchange for capacity from an operational perspective all of our manufacturing facilities continue to operate around the world in accordance with guidance issued by local and national government authorities 

sales marketing and customers 

we market our products and solutions worldwide to a variety of oems original design manufacturers odms contract manufacturers and distributors we generate demand for our products by delivering product solutions to our customers and supporting their system designin activities by providing application architecture expertise and local field application engineering support 

our sales and marketing teams are organized into five regions which are emea europe the middle east and africa the americas japan south korea and greater china including asia pacific these sales regions are responsible for managing customer relationships and creating demand for our solutions through the full ecosystem development including our distributors and at our large number of mass market customers 

our sales and marketing strategy focuses on key defined verticals in automotive mobile industrial  iot and communication infrastructure deepening our relationship with our top oems and electronic manufacturing service customers expanding our reach to our mass market customers startups and our distribution partners and becoming their preferred supplier which we believe assists us in reducing sales volatility in challenging markets we have longstanding customer relationships with most of our customers our 10 largest oem end customers some of whom are supplied by distributors in alphabetical order are apple aptiv bosch continental denso ericsson huawei lg samsung and visteon we also have a strong position with our distribution partners including our three largest arrow avnet and sac 

our revenue is primarily the sum of our direct sales to oems plus our distributors’ resale of nxp products avnet accounted for 17 of our revenue in 2020 and 14 in 2019 no other distributor accounted for greater than 10 of our revenue continental accounted for less than 10 of our revenue in 2020 and 11 in 2019 no other oem for which we had direct sales to accounted for more than 10 revenue in 2020 or 2019 

research and development 

we believe that our future success depends on our ability to both improve our existing products and to develop new products for both existing and new markets we direct our research and development efforts largely to the development of new semiconductor solutions where we see significant opportunities for growth we target applications that require stringent overall system and subsystem performance as new and challenging applications proliferate we believe that many of these applications will benefit from our solutions we have assembled a global team of highly skilled semiconductor and embedded software design engineers with expertise in rf analog power management interface security and digital processing 

to outpace market growth we invest in research and development to extend or create leading market positions with an emphasis on fast growing sizable market segments such as adas invehicle networks and power management as well as edge computing to support the successful deployment in the iot with our crossover processing technology but also in emerging markets such as massive mimo in rf power and mmwave for 5g in addition we invest a few percent of our total research and development expenditures in research activities that develop fundamental new technologies or product categories that could contribute significantly to our companys growth in the future 

we annually perform a fundamental review of our business portfolio and our related new product and technology development opportunities in order to decide on changes in the allocation of our research and development resources for products targeting established markets we evaluate our research and development expenditures based on clear business need and risk assessments for breakthrough technologies and new market opportunities we look at the strategic fit and synergies with the rest of our portfolio and the size of the potential addressable market overall we allocate our research and development to maintain a healthy mix of emerging growth and mature businesses 

intellectual property 

the creation and use of intellectual property is a key aspect of our strategy to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace we seek to protect our proprietary technologies by obtaining patents trademarks domain names retaining trade secrets and defending enforcing and utilizing our intellectual property rights where appropriate 

we believe this strategy allows us to preserve the advantages of our products and technologies and helps us to improve the return on our investment in research and development we have a broad portfolio of approximately 9500 patent families each patent family includes all patents and patent applications originating from the same invention to protect confidential technical information and software we rely on copyright and trade secret law and enter into confidentiality agreements as applicable in situations where we believe that a third party has infringed on our intellectual property we enforce our rights through all available legal means to the extent that we determine the benefits of such actions to outweigh the costs and risks involved 

we own a number of trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business where we consider it desirable we develop names for our new products and secure trademark protection our trademarks allow us to further distinguish our company and our products and are important in our relationships with customers suppliers partners and endusers 

while our patents trademarks trade secrets and other intellectual property rights constitute valuable assets we do not view any individual right or asset as material to our operations as a whole we believe it is the combination of our proprietary technology patents knowhow and other intellectual property rights and assets that creates an advantage for our business 

in addition to obtaining our own patents and other intellectual property rights we have entered into licensing agreements and other arrangements authorizing us to use intellectual property rights confidential technical information software and other technology owned by third parties we also engage in certain instances in licensing and selling of certain of our technology patents and other intellectual property rights 

competition 

we compete with many different semiconductor companies including multinational companies with integrated research and development manufacturing sales and marketing organizations across a broad spectrum of product lines “fabless” semiconductor companies and companies that are focused on a single application market segment or standard product most of these competitors compete with us with respect to some but not all of our businesses 

our key competitors in alphabetical order include analog devices inc infineon technologies ag maxim integrated products inc mediatek microchip technology inc nordic semiconductor asa power integrations inc qorvo qualcomm inc renesas electronics corp silicon laboratories stmicroelectronics nv and texas instruments incorporated 

the basis on which we compete varies across end markets and geographic regions this includes competing on the basis of our ability to timely develop new products and the underlying intellectual property and on meeting customer requirements in terms of cost product features quality warranty and availability in addition our system solutions businesses require indepth knowledge of a given application market in order to develop robust system solutions and qualified customer support resources 

seasonality

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to the coronavirus covid19 pandemic 

the extent to which the coronavirus covid19 outbreak and measures taken in response thereto could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict the covid19 pandemic and measures taken in response have adversely impacted the companys financial condition and results of operations 

the novel strain of the coronavirus identified in china in late 2019 has globally spread throughout other areas such as asia europe the middle east and north america and has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and shutdowns these measures have adversely impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations the operations of our customers and those of our respective vendors and suppliers we have significant manufacturing operations in china malaysia thailand singapore taiwan the netherlands and the us and each of these countries has been affected by the outbreak and taken measures to try to contain it there is considerable uncertainty regarding such measures and potential future measures and restrictions on our access to our manufacturing facilities or on our support operations or workforce or similar limitations for our vendors and suppliers and restrictions or disruptions of transportation such as reduced availability of air transport port closures and increased border controls or closures could limit our capacity to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the outbreak has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty we experienced significant decline in revenue in the first half of 2020 related to the covid19 outbreak although we experienced improvements in the business environment in the second half of 2020 the situation remains uncertain and the continued spread of covid19 may result in another economic slowdown similar or worse than what we experienced in the first half of 2020 including the possibility that it could lead to a global recession risks 

related to a slowdown or recession are described in our risk factor titled “significantly increased volatility and instability and unfavorable economic conditions may adversely affect our business” below 

the spread of covid19 has caused us to modify our business practices including employee travel employee work locations and cancellation of physical participation in meetings events and conferences and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners and suppliers there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed 

the degree to which covid19 adversely impacts our future results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including but not limited to the duration and spread of the outbreak its severity the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume even after the covid19 outbreak has subsided we may experience material adverse impacts to our business as a result of the global economic impact and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows it may also heighten many of the other risks described below there are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of covid19 as a global pandemic may have and as a result the ultimate impact of the outbreak on our operations and financial results is highly uncertain and subject to change 

risks related to the semiconductor industry and the markets in which we participate 

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical 

historically the relationship between supply and demand in the semiconductor industry has caused a high degree of cyclicality in the semiconductor market semiconductor supply is partly driven by manufacturing capacity which in the past has demonstrated alternating periods of substantial capacity additions and periods in which no or limited capacity was added as a general matter semiconductor companies are more likely to add capacity in periods when current or expected future demand is strong and margins are or are expected to be high investments in new capacity can result in overcapacity which can lead to a reduction in prices and margins in response companies typically limit further capacity additions eventually causing the market to be relatively undersupplied in addition demand for semiconductors varies which can exacerbate the effect of supply fluctuations as a result of this cyclicality the semiconductor industry has in the past experienced significant downturns such as in 19971998 20012002 and in 20082009 often in connection with or in anticipation of maturing life cycles of semiconductor companies’ products and declines in general economic conditions these downturns have been characterized by diminishing demand for enduser products high inventory levels underutilization of manufacturing capacity and accelerated erosion of average selling prices the foregoing risks have historically had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

significantly increased volatility and instability and unfavorable economic conditions may adversely affect our business 

it is difficult for us our customers and suppliers to forecast demand trends we may be unable to accurately predict the extent or duration of cycles or their effect on our financial condition or result of operations and can give no assurance as to the timing extent or duration of the current or future business cycles generally or specific to the markets in which we participate in the first half of 2020 demand in the automotive market steeply declined as a result of manufacturing shutdowns by automotive oems due to the coronavirus pandemic resulting in an unforeseen negative impact to our results of operations in 2008 and 2009 europe the united states and international markets experienced increased volatility and instability related to the global financial crisis in the event of a future decline in global economic conditions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the resulting economic decline might disproportionately affect the markets in which we participate further exacerbating a decline in our results of operations 

the semiconductor industry is highly competitive if we fail to introduce new technologies and products in a timely manner this could adversely affect our business 

the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and characterized by constant and rapid technological change short product lifecycles significant price erosion and evolving standards accordingly the success of our business depends to a significant extent on our ability to develop new technologies and products that are 

ultimately successful in the market the costs related to the research and development necessary to develop new technologies and products are significant and any reduction of our research and development budget could harm our competitiveness meeting evolving industry requirements and introducing new products to the market in a timely manner and at prices that are acceptable to our customers are significant factors in determining our competitiveness and success commitments to develop new products must be made well in advance of any resulting sales and technologies and standards may change during development potentially rendering our products outdated or uncompetitive before their introduction if we are unable to successfully develop new products our revenue may decline substantially moreover some of our competitors are wellestablished entities are larger than us and have greater resources than we do if these competitors increase the resources they devote to developing and marketing their products we may not be able to compete effectively any consolidation among our competitors could enhance their product offerings and financial resources further strengthening their competitive position in addition some of our competitors operate in narrow business areas relative to us allowing them to concentrate their research and development efforts directly on products and services for those areas which may give them a competitive advantage as a result of these competitive pressures we may face declining sales volumes or lower prevailing prices for our products and we may not be able to reduce our total costs in line with this declining revenue if any of these risks materialize they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the demand for our products depends to a significant degree on the demand for our customers’ end products 

the vast majority of our revenue is derived from sales to manufacturers in the automotive industrial  iot mobile and communication infrastructure demand in these markets fluctuates significantly driven by consumer spending consumer preferences the development of new technologies and prevailing economic conditions in addition the specific products in which our semiconductors are incorporated may not be successful or may experience price erosion or other competitive factors that affect the price manufacturers are willing to pay us such customers have in the past and may in the future vary order levels significantly from period to period request postponements to scheduled delivery dates modify their orders or reduce lead times this is particularly common during periods of low demand this can make managing our business difficult as it limits the predictability of future revenue it can also affect the accuracy of our financial forecasts furthermore developing industry trends including customers’ use of outsourcing and new and revised supply chain models may affect our revenue costs and working capital requirements 

if customers do not purchase products made specifically for them we may not be able to resell such products to other customers or may not be able to require the customers who have ordered these products to pay a cancellation fee the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by continued price erosion especially after a product has been on the market 

one of the results of the rapid innovation in the semiconductor industry is that pricing pressure especially on products containing older technology can be intense product life cycles are relatively short and as a result products tend to be replaced by more technologically advanced substitutes on a regular basis 

in turn demand for older technology falls causing the price at which such products can be sold to drop in some cases precipitously in order to continue profitably supplying these products we must reduce our production costs in line with the lower revenue we can expect to generate per unit usually this must be accomplished through improvements in process technology and production efficiencies if we cannot advance our process technologies or improve our efficiencies to a degree sufficient to maintain required margins we will no longer be able to make a profit from the sale of these products moreover we may not be able to cease production of such products either due to contractual obligations or for customer relationship reasons and as a result may be required to bear a loss on such products we cannot guarantee that competition in our core product markets will not lead to price erosion lower revenue or lower margins in the future should reductions in our manufacturing costs fail to keep pace with reductions in market prices for the products we sell this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to our business operations 

in many of the market segments in which we compete we depend on winning selection processes and failure to be selected could adversely affect our business in those market segments 

one of our business strategies is to participate in and win competitive bid selection processes to develop products for use in our customers’ equipment and products these selection processes can be lengthy and require us to incur significant design and development expenditures with no guarantee of winning a contract or generating revenue failure to win new design projects and delays in developing new products with anticipated technological advances or in commencing volume shipments of these products may have an adverse effect on our business this risk is particularly pronounced in markets where there are only a few potential customers and in the automotive market where due to the longer design cycles involved failure to win a designin could prevent access to a customer for several years our failure to win a sufficient number of these bids could result in reduced revenue and hurt our competitive position in future selection processes because we may not be perceived as being a technology or industry leader each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our global business operations expose us to international business risks that could adversely affect our business 

if any of the following international business risks were to materialize or become worse they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

• negative economic developments in economies around the world and the instability of governments and international trade arrangements such as the increase of barriers to international trade including the recent imposition of tariffs on imports by the united states and china the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union and the sovereign debt crisis in certain european countries 

• social and political instability in a number of countries around the world including continued hostilities and civil unrest in the middle east the instability may have a negative effect on our business financial condition and operations via our customers and volatility in energy prices and the financial markets 

• potential terrorist attacks 

• epidemics and pandemics such as the coronavirus outbreak which may adversely affect our workforce as well as our suppliers and customers 

• adverse changes in governmental policies especially those affecting trade and investment 

• volatility in foreign currency exchange rates in particular with respect to the us dollar and transfer restrictions in particular in china and 

• threats that our operations or property could be subject to nationalization and expropriation 

goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets 

goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition as a result of our acquisition of marvell’s wireless wifi connectivity business unit bluetooth technology portfolio and related assets in 2019 we recognized goodwill of 11 billion and intangible assets of 05 billion as a result of our acquisition of freescale in 2015 we recognized goodwill of 74 billion and intangible assets of 85 billion we review our goodwill and other intangible assets balance for impairment upon any indication of a potential impairment and in the case of goodwill at a minimum of once a year impairment may result from among other things a sustained decrease in share price deterioration in performance adverse market conditions adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including changes that restrict the activities of or affect the products and services we sell challenges to the validity of certain registered intellectual property reduced sales of certain products incorporating intellectual property and a variety of other factors the amount of any quantified impairment must be expensed immediately as a charge to results of operations depending on future circumstances it is possible that we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets any future determination of impairment of goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and stockholders’ equity 

in difficult market conditions our high fixed costs combined with low revenue may negatively affect our results of operations 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by high fixed costs and notwithstanding our utilization of thirdparty manufacturing capacity our production requirements are in part met by our own manufacturing facilities in less favorable industry environments like we faced in the first half of 2020 we are generally faced with a decline in the utilization rates of our manufacturing facilities due to decreases in demand for our products during such periods our fabrication plants could operate at lower loading level while the fixed costs associated with the full capacity continue to be incurred resulting in lower gross profit 

we may from time to time restructure parts of our organization any such restructuring may impact customer satisfaction and the costs of implementation may be difficult to predict 

we have previously executed restructuring initiatives and continue to assess restructure and make changes to parts of the processes in our organization if the global economy remains volatile our revenues could decline and we may be forced to take additional cost savings steps that could result in additional charges and materially affect our business the costs of implementing any restructurings changes or cost savings steps may differ from our estimates and any negative impacts on our revenues or otherwise of such restructurings changes or steps such as situations in which customer satisfaction is negatively impacted may be larger than originally estimated 

if we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements and social plans with our labor unions as they expire from time to time if regular or statutory consultation processes with employee representatives such as works councils fail or are delayed or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage our business and operating results could be materially harmed 

we are a party to collective bargaining agreements and social plans with our labor unions we are also required to consult with our employee representatives such as works councils on items such as restructurings acquisitions and divestitures although we believe that our relations with our employees employee representatives and unions are satisfactory no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate these agreements as they expire from time to time or to conclude the consultation processes in a timely and favorable way the impact of future negotiations and consultation processes with employee representatives could have a material impact on our financial results also if we fail to extend or renegotiate our labor agreements and social plans if significant disputes with our unions arise or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage we could incur higher ongoing labor costs or experience a significant disruption of operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our working capital needs are difficult to predict 

our working capital needs are difficult to predict and may fluctuate the comparatively long period between the time at which we commence development of a product and the time at which it may be delivered to a customer leads to high inventory and workinprogress levels the volatility of our customers’ own businesses and the time required to manufacture products also makes it difficult to manage inventory levels and requires us to stockpile products across many different specifications 

our business may be adversely affected by costs relating to product defects and we could be faced with product liability and warranty claims 

we make highly complex electronic components and accordingly there is a risk that defects may occur in any of our products such defects can give rise to significant costs including expenses relating to recalling products replacing defective items writing down defective inventory and loss of potential sales in addition the occurrence of such defects may give rise to product liability and warranty claims including liability for damages caused by such defects if we release defective products into the market our reputation could suffer and we may lose sales opportunities and incur liability for damages moreover since the cost of replacing defective semiconductor devices is often much higher than the value of the devices themselves we may at times face damage claims from customers in excess of the amounts they pay us for our products including consequential damages we also face exposure to potential liability resulting from the fact that our customers typically integrate the semiconductors we sell into numerous consumer products which are then sold into the marketplace we are exposed to product liability claims if our semiconductors or the consumer products based on them malfunction and result in personal injury or death we may be named in product liability claims even if there is no evidence that our products caused the damage in question and such claims could result in significant costs 

and expenses relating to attorneys’ fees and damages in addition our customers may recall their products if they prove to be defective or make compensatory payments in accordance with industry or business practice or in order to maintain good customer relationships if such a recall or payment is caused by a defect in one of our products our customers may seek to recover all or a portion of their losses from us if any of these risks materialize our reputation would be harmed and there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business has suffered and could in the future suffer from manufacturing problems 

we manufacture in our own factories as well as with third parties our products using processes that are highly complex require advanced and costly equipment and must continuously be modified to improve yields and performance difficulties in the production process can reduce yields or interrupt production and as a result of such problems we may on occasion not be able to deliver products or do so in a timely or costeffective or competitive manner as the complexity of both our products and our fabrication processes has become more advanced manufacturing tolerances have been reduced and requirements for precision have become more demanding as is common in the semiconductor industry we have in the past experienced manufacturing difficulties that have given rise to delays in delivery and quality control problems there can be no assurance that any such occurrence in the future would not materially harm our results of operations further we may suffer disruptions in our manufacturing operations either due to production difficulties such as those described above or as a result of external factors beyond our control we may in the future experience manufacturing difficulties or permanent or temporary loss of manufacturing capacity due to the preceding or other risks any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on the timely supply of equipment and materials and could suffer if suppliers fail to meet their delivery obligations or raise prices certain equipment and materials needed in our manufacturing operations are only available from a limited number of suppliers 

our manufacturing operations depend on deliveries of equipment and materials in a timely manner and in some cases on a justintime basis from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit the amounts supplied to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors supply disruptions may also occur due to shortages in critical materials such as silicon wafers or specialized chemicals because the equipment that we purchase is complex it is frequently difficult or impossible for us to substitute one piece of equipment for another or replace one type of material with another a failure by our suppliers to deliver our requirements could result in disruptions to our manufacturing operations our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of quality equipment or materials in a timely manner or if there are significant increases in the costs of equipment or materials 

failure of our third party suppliers to perform could adversely affect our ability to exploit growth opportunities 

we currently use outside suppliers for a portion of our manufacturing capacity outsourcing our production presents a number of risks if our outside suppliers are unable to satisfy our demand or experience manufacturing difficulties delays or reduced yields our results of operations and ability to satisfy customer demand could suffer in addition purchasing rather than manufacturing these products may adversely affect our gross profit margin if the purchase costs of these products are higher than our own manufacturing costs would have been prices for foundry products also vary depending on capacity utilization rates at our suppliers quantities demanded product technology and geometry furthermore these outsourcing costs can vary materially from quarter to quarter and in cases of industry shortages they can increase significantly negatively affecting our gross profit 

disruptions in our relationships with any one of our key customers could adversely affect our business 

a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from our top customers including our distributors we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate similar levels of revenue from our largest customers in the future if one or more of these customers substantially reduce their purchases from us this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we receive subsidies and grants in certain countries and a reduction in the amount of governmental funding available to us or demands for repayment could increase our costs and affect our results of operations 

as is the case with other large semiconductor companies we receive subsidies and grants from governments in some countries these programs are subject to periodic review by the relevant governments and if any of these programs are curtailed or discontinued this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as the availability of government funding is outside our control we cannot guarantee that we will continue to benefit from government support or that sufficient alternative funding will be available if we lose such support moreover if we terminate any activities or operations including strategic alliances or joint ventures we may face adverse actions from the local governmental agencies providing such subsidies to us in particular such government agencies could seek to recover such subsidies from us and they could cancel or reduce other subsidies we receive from them this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

certain natural disasters such as flooding large earthquakes volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters may negatively impact our business there is increasing concern that climate change is occurring and may cause a rising number of natural disasters 

environmental and other disasters such as flooding large earthquakes volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters or a combination thereof may negatively impact our business if flooding a large earthquake volcanic eruption or other natural disaster were to directly damage destroy or disrupt our manufacturing facilities it could disrupt our operations delay new production and shipments of existing inventory or result in costly repairs replacements or other costs all of which would negatively impact our business even if our manufacturing facilities are not directly damaged a large natural disaster may result in disruptions in distribution channels or supply chains and significant increases in the prices of raw materials used for our manufacturing process for instance the nuclear incident following the tsunami in japan in 2011 impacted the supply chains of our customers and suppliers furthermore any disaster affecting our customers or their respective customers may significantly negatively impact the demand for our products and our revenues 

the impact of any such natural disasters depends on the specific geographic circumstances but could be significant as some of our factories are located in areas with known earthquake fault zones flood or storm risks including but not limited to singapore taiwan malaysia or thailand there is increasing concern that climate change is occurring that may cause a rising number of natural disasters with potentially dramatic effects on human activity we cannot predict the economic impact if any of natural disasters or climate change 

risks related to regulatory or legal challenges 

as our business is global we need to comply with laws and regulations in countries across the world 

we operate globally with manufacturing assembly and testing facilities in several continents and we market our products globally 

as a result we are subject to environmental data privacy labor and health and safety laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate we are also required to obtain environmental permits and other authorizations or licenses from governmental authorities for certain of our operations in the jurisdictions where we operate we need to comply with differing standards and varying practices of regulatory tax judicial and administrative bodies 

no assurance can be given that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with the laws and regulations to which we are subject or that we have obtained or will obtain the permits and other authorizations or licenses that we need if we violate or fail to comply with laws regulations permits and other authorizations or licenses we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators furthermore if one or more of our customers are sanctioned by regulators for noncompliance with laws and regulations we could experience a decrease in demand for our products for example import and export regulations such as the us export administration regulations administered by the us department of commerce are complex change frequently have generally become more stringent over time and have intensified in recent years our results of operations could be negatively impacted if are required to suspend activities with certain customers or suppliers due to future changes in regulations in 2020 due to regulations imposed by the us government we ceased shipments of our products to huawei pending approval of export licenses furthermore global privacy legislation enforcement and policy activity such as the eu general data privacy regulation are rapidly 

expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment costs to comply with and implement these privacyrelated and data protection measures could be significant even our inadvertent failure to comply with applicable privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others 

legal proceedings covering a range of matters are pending in various jurisdictions due to the uncertainty inherent in litigation it is difficult to predict the final outcome an adverse outcome might affect our results of operations 

we and certain of our businesses are involved as plaintiffs or defendants in legal proceedings in various matters for example we are involved in legal proceedings claiming personal injuries to the children of former employees as a result of employees’ alleged exposure to chemicals used in semiconductor manufacturing clean room environments operated by us or our former parent companies philips and motorola furthermore because we continue to utilize these clean rooms we may become subject to future claims alleging personal injury that may lead to additional liability a judgment against us or material defense cost could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

environmental laws and regulations expose us to liability and compliance with these laws and regulations and any such liability may adversely affect our business 

we are subject to many environmental health and safety laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate which govern among other things emissions of pollutants into the air wastewater discharges the use and handling of hazardous substances waste disposal the investigation and remediation of soil and ground water contamination and the health and safety of our employees we are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws regulations and permits if we violate or fail to comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 

as with other companies engaged in similar activities or that own or operate real property we face inherent risks of environmental liability at our current and historical manufacturing facilities certain environmental laws impose strict and in certain circumstances joint and several liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substances as well as liability for related damages to natural resources certain of these laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated while we do not expect that any contamination currently known to us will have a material adverse effect on our business we cannot assure you that this is the case or that we will not discover new facts or conditions or that environmental laws or the enforcement of such laws will not change such that our liabilities would be increased significantly in addition we could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage in summary we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to regulated materials will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions and results of operations 

scientific examination of political attention to and rules and regulations on issues surrounding the existence and extent of climate change may result in an increase in the cost of production due to increase in the prices of energy and introduction of energy or carbon tax a variety of regulatory developments have been introduced that focus on restricting or managing the emission of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases enterprises may need to purchase at higher costs new equipment or raw materials with lower carbon footprints environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment modify product designs or incur expenses new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may become subject to regulation these developments and further legislation that is likely to be enacted could affect our operations negatively changes in environmental regulations could increase our production and operational costs which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to cybersecurity and it systems 

interruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology applications systems and networks to operate our business the reliability and security of our information technology 

infrastructure and software and our ability to expand and continually update technologies in response to our changing needs is critical to our business any significant interruption in our business applications systems or networks including but not limited to new system implementations computer viruses cyberattacks security breaches facility issues or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our computer systems and networks are subject to attempted security breaches and other cybersecurity incidents which if successful could impact our business 

we have from time to time experienced cyberattacks attempting to obtain access to our computer systems and networks such incidents whether or not successful could result in the misappropriation of our proprietary information and technology the compromise of personal and confidential information of our employees customers or suppliers or interrupt our business for instance in january 2020 we became aware of a compromise of certain of our systems while this it system compromise did not result in a material adverse effect on our business or any material damage to us there can be no assurance that this or any other breach or incident will not have a material impact on our operations and financial results in the future in the current environment there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy including criminal hackers statesponsored intrusions industrial espionage employee malfeasance and human or technological error computer hackers and others routinely attempt to breach the security of technology products services and systems and those of customers suppliers and some of those attempts may be successful such breaches could result in for example unauthorized access to disclosure modification misuse loss or destruction of our our customer or other third party data or systems theft of sensitive or confidential data including personal information including personal data about our employees customers or other third parties and intellectual property system disruptions and denial of service in the event of such breaches we our customers or other third parties could be exposed to potential liability litigation and regulatory action as well as the loss of existing or potential customers damage to our reputation and other financial loss in addition the cost and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant as these threats continue to develop and grow we have been adapting our security measures and we continue to increase the amount we allocate to implement maintain andor update security systems to protect data and infrastructure as a global enterprise we could also be impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity privacy and data protection additionally cyberattacks or other catastrophic events resulting in disruptions to or failures in power information technology communication systems or other critical infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to us our customers or other third party operations or services financial loss potential liability and damage our reputation and affect our relationships with our customers and suppliers 

risks related to intellectual property 

we rely to a significant extent on proprietary intellectual property we may not be able to protect this intellectual property against improper use by our competitors or others 

our success and future revenue growth depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology our products our proprietary designs and fabrication processes and other intellectual property against misappropriation by others we primarily rely on patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our intellectual property we may have difficulty obtaining patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our proprietary products technology and intellectual property and the patents and other intellectual property rights we receive may be insufficient to provide us with meaningful protection or commercial advantage we may not obtain patent protection or secure other intellectual property rights in all the countries in which we operate and under the laws of such countries patents and other intellectual property rights may be or become unavailable or limited in scope even if new patents are issued the claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to effectively protect our proprietary technology processes and other intellectual property in addition any of our existing patents and any future patents issued to us may be challenged invalidated or circumvented the protection offered by intellectual property rights may be inadequate or weakened for reasons or circumstances that are out of our control further our proprietary technology designs and processes and other intellectual property may be vulnerable to disclosure or misappropriation by employees contractors and other persons it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain copy use or disclose our proprietary technologies our products designs processes and other intellectual property despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property while we hold a 

significant number of patents there can be no assurances that additional patents will be issued or that any rights granted under our patents will provide meaningful protection against misappropriation of our intellectual property our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents we may not have or pursue patents or pending applications in all the countries in which we operate corresponding to all of our primary patents and applications even if patents are granted effective enforcement in some countries may not be available in particular intellectual property rights are difficult to enforce in countries where the application and enforcement of the laws governing such rights may not have reached the same level as compared to other jurisdictions where we operate consequently operating in some countries may subject us to an increased risk that unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise use our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our suppliers or other parties with whom we engage there is no assurance that we will be able to protect our intellectual property rights or have adequate legal recourse in the event that we seek legal or judicial enforcement of our intellectual property rights under the laws of such countries any inability on our part to adequately protect our intellectual property may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may become party to intellectual property claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products 

we have from time to time received and may in the future receive communications alleging possible infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights of others further we may become involved in costly litigation brought against us regarding patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets or other intellectual property rights if any such claims are asserted against us we may seek to obtain a license under the third party’s intellectual property rights we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain any or all of the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms if at all in the event that we cannot obtain or take the view that we don’t need a license these parties may file lawsuits against us seeking damages and potentially treble damages in the united states or an injunction against the sale of our products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presently conducted such lawsuits if successful could result in an increase in the costs of selling certain of our products our having to partially or completely redesign our products or stop the sale of some of our products and could cause damage to our reputation any litigation could require significant financial and management resources regardless of the merits or outcome and we cannot assure you that we would prevail in any litigation or that our intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged the award of damages including material royalty payments or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products could affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to human capital management 

loss of our key management and other personnel or an inability to attract such management and other personnel could affect our business 

we depend on our key management to run our business and on our senior engineers to develop new products and technologies our success will depend on the continued service of these individuals although we have several share based compensation plans in place we cannot be sure that these plans will help us in our ability to retain key personnel especially considering that the stock options under some of our plans become exercisable upon a change of control in particular when a third party or third parties acting in concert obtains whether directly or indirectly control of us the loss of any of our key personnel whether due to departures death ill health or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business the market for qualified employees including skilled engineers and other individuals with the required technical expertise to succeed in our business is highly competitive and the loss of qualified employees or an inability to attract retain and motivate the additional highly skilled employees required for the operation and expansion of our business could hinder our ability to successfully conduct research activities or develop marketable products the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business 

risks related to our corporate structure 

united states civil liabilities may not be enforceable against us 

we are incorporated under the laws of the netherlands and substantial portions of our assets are located outside of the united states in addition certain members of our board our officers and certain experts named herein reside outside the united states as a result it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the united states upon us or such other persons residing outside the united states or to enforce outside the united states judgments obtained against such persons in us courts in any action in addition it may be difficult for investors to enforce in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the united states rights predicated upon the us laws 

in the absence of an applicable treaty for the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments other than arbitration awards in civil and commercial matters to which the united states and the netherlands are a party a judgment obtained against the company in the courts of the united states whether or not predicated solely upon the us federal securities laws including a judgment predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the us securities law or securities laws of any state or territory within the united states will not be directly enforceable in the netherlands 

in order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the netherlands the claim must be relitigated before a competent court of the netherlands the relevant netherlands court has discretion to attach such weight to a judgment of the courts of the united states as it deems appropriate based on case law the courts of the netherlands may be expected to recognize and grant permission for enforcement of a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction in the united states without reexamination or relitigation of the substantive matters adjudicated thereby provided that i the relevant court in the united states had jurisdiction in the matter in accordance with standards which are generally accepted internationally ii the proceedings before that court complied with principles of proper procedure iii recognition andor enforcement of that judgment does not conflict with the public policy of the netherlands and iv recognition andor enforcement of that judgment is not irreconcilable with a decision of a dutch court rendered between the same parties or with an earlier decision of a foreign court rendered between the same parties in a dispute that is about the same subject matter and that is based on the same cause provided that earlier decision can be recognized in the netherlands 

based on the foregoing there can be no assurance that us investors will be able to enforce against us or members of our board of directors officers or certain experts named herein who are residents of the netherlands or countries other than the united states any judgments obtained in us courts in civil and commercial matters 

in addition there is doubt as to whether a dutch court would impose civil liability on us the members of our board of directors our officers or certain experts named herein in an original action predicated solely upon the us laws brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in the netherlands against us or such members officers or experts respectively 

we are a dutch public company with limited liability the rights of our stockholders may be different from the rights of stockholders governed by the laws of us jurisdictions 

we are a dutch public company with limited liability naamloze vennootschap  our corporate affairs are governed by our articles of association and by the laws governing companies incorporated in the netherlands the rights of stockholders and the responsibilities of members of our board of directors may be different from the rights and obligations of stockholders in companies governed by the laws of us jurisdictions in the performance of its duties our board of directors is required by dutch law to consider the interests of our company its stockholders its employees and other stakeholders in all cases with due observation of the principles of reasonableness and fairness it is possible that some of these parties will have interests that are different from or in addition to your interests as a stockholder see part iii item 10 directors executive officers and corporate governance  

risks related to our indebtedness 

our debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our financial condition which could adversely affect our results of operations 

as of december 31 2020 we had outstanding indebtedness with an aggregate principal amount of 7650 million our substantial indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business by 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic industry or competitive developments 

• requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations capital expenditures and future business opportunities 

• exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates in the event we have borrowings under our 1500 million revolving credit facility agreement the “rcf agreement” because loans under the rcf agreement bear interest at a variable rate 

• making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and any failure to comply with the obligations of any our debt instruments including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions could result in an event default under the indentures governing our notes and agreements governing other indebtedness 

• restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financial for working capital capital expenditures restructurings product development research and development debt service requirements investments acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes and 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who therefore may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting 

despite our level of indebtedness we may still incur significantly more debt which could further exacerbate the risks described above and affect our ability to service and repay our debt 

if we do not comply with the covenants in our debt agreements or fail to generate sufficient cash to service and repay our debt it could adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition 

the rcf agreement and the indentures governing our unsecured notes or any other debt arrangements that we may have require us to comply with various covenants if there were an event of default under any of our debt instruments that was not cured or waived the holders of the defaulted debt could terminate commitments to lend and cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt to be due and payable immediately which in turn could result in cross defaults under our other debt instruments our assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under all of our outstanding debt instruments if some or all of these instruments are accelerated upon an event of default 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets seek additional capital restructure or refinance our indebtedness or reduce or delay capital expenditures strategic acquisitions investments and alliances any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt and fund our planned capital expenditures and business plan our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives in addition any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations 

the rating of our debt by major rating agencies may further improve or deteriorate which could affect our additional borrowing capacity and financing costs 

the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt these ratings are based on current information furnished to the ratings agencies by us and information obtained by the ratings agencies from other sources an explanation of the significance of such rating may be obtained from such rating agency there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in each rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any 

announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade could affect our market value andor increase our corporate borrowing costs 

general risk factors 

the price of our common stock historically has been volatile the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly 

the stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies the market price for our common stock has varied between a high of 16727 on december 7 2020 and a low of 5841 on march 18 2020 in the twelvemonth period ending on december 31 2020 the market price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations for many reasons including in response to the risks described in this section changes in our dividend or share repurchase policies variations between our actual financial results or guidance and expectations of securities analysts or investors or for reasons unrelated to our operations such as reports by industry analysts investor perceptions or negative announcements by our customers competitors peer companies or suppliers regarding their own performance or announcements by our competitors of significant contracts strategic partnerships joint ventures joint marketing relationships or capital commitments the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments affecting us or our industry as well as industry conditions and general financial economic and political instability in the past following periods of market volatility shareholders have instituted securities class action litigation if we were involved in securities litigation it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of executive management from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation 

we may have fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases 

the amount timing and execution of our stock repurchases may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes—such as investing in our business including operational spending capital spending and acquisitions and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments—and because of changes in cash flows tax laws and the market price of our common stock 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends 

our board of directors has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we currently pay a cash dividend on our ordinary shares on a quarterly basis the declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the approval of our board and our dividend may be discontinued or reduced at any time there can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends in the future in any particular amounts or at all 

future dividends if any and their timing and amount may be affected by among other factors management’s views on potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions including acquisitions earnings levels contractual restrictions cash position and overall financial condition and changes to our business model the payment of cash dividends is restricted by applicable law contractual restrictions and our corporate structure 

the impact of a negative performance of financial markets and demographic trends on our defined benefit pension liabilities and costs cannot be predicted 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans in a number of countries and a significant number of our employees are covered by our defined benefit pension plans as of december 31 2020 we had recognized a net accrued benefit liability of 566 million representing the unfunded benefit obligations of our defined pension plans the funding status and the liabilities and costs of maintaining these defined benefit pension plans may be impacted by financial market developments for example the accounting for such plans requires determining discount rates expected rates of compensation and expected returns on plan assets and any changes in these variables can have a significant impact on the projected benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs negative performance of the financial markets could also have a material impact on funding requirements and net periodic pension costs our defined benefit pension plans may also be subject to demographic trends accordingly our costs to meet pension liabilities going forward may be significantly higher than they are today which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 

future changes to dutch us and other foreign tax laws could adversely affect us 

the european commission us congress and treasury department the organization for economic cooperation and development and other government agencies in jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations particularly payments made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates as a result the tax laws in the european union us and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could adversely affect us and our affiliates 

recent examples include the organization for economic cooperation and development’s initiatives to revise profit allocation and nexus rules to allocate more taxing rights to countries where companies have their markets and to establish a minimum tax rate on a global basis these initiatives include recommendations and proposals that if enacted in countries in which we and our affiliates do business could adversely affect us and our affiliates 

we are exposed to a number of different tax uncertainties which could have an impact on our results 

we are required to pay taxes in multiple jurisdictions we determine the taxes we are required to pay based on our interpretation of the applicable tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we may be subject to unfavorable changes in the respective tax laws and regulations to which we are subject tax controls audits change in controls and changes in tax laws or regulations or the interpretation given to them may expose us to negative tax consequences including interest payments and potentially penalties we have issued transferpricing directives in the areas of goods services and financing which are in accordance with the guidelines of the organization of economic cooperation and development oecd as transfer pricing has a cross border effect the focus of local tax authorities on implemented transfer pricing procedures in a country may have an impact on results in another country 

transfer pricing uncertainties can also result from disputes with local tax authorities about transfer pricing of internal deliveries of goods and services or related to financing acquisitions and divestments the use of tax credits and permanent establishments and tax losses carried forward these uncertainties may have a significant impact on local tax results we also have various tax assets resulting from acquisitions tax assets can also result from the generation of tax losses in certain legal entities tax authorities may challenge these tax assets in addition the value of the tax assets resulting from tax losses carried forward depends on having sufficient taxable profits in the future 

additionally in december of 2017 the united states enacted a budget reconciliation act amending the internal revenue code of 1986 the “tax cuts and jobs act” and as from 2018 the us treasury department issued regulations to clarify certain provisions of the tax cuts and jobs act the tax cuts and jobs act contains provisions affecting the tax treatment of both us companies such as certain of our subsidiaries and nonus companies that could materially affect us the tax cuts and jobs act includes provisions that reduce the us corporate tax rate impose a base erosion minimum tax on income of a us corporation determined without regard to certain otherwise deductible payments made to certain foreign affiliates impose a global intangible lowincome tax on foreign earnings made by us corporations’ foreign subsidiaries and impose a onetime transition tax on certain historic earnings and profits of usowned foreign subsidiaries the tax cuts and jobs act also includes provisions that provide a deduction for certain foreignderived intangible income the us treasury department has issued temporary and proposed regulations providing guidance on the application of many of the provisions of the tax cuts and jobs act however there may continue to be a substantial delay before all such regulations are promulgated andor finalized increasing the uncertainty as to the ultimate effect of the statutory amendments on us it is also possible that there will be technical corrections legislation proposed with respect to the tax cuts and jobs act the effect of which cannot be predicted

overview 



revenue for 2020 was 8612 million down 3 from 2019 against a very challenging economic environment caused by the covid19 pandemic by end market automotive revenue was 3825 million a decrease of 9 versus the year ago period within the communication infrastructure  other end market revenue was 1703 million a decline of 9 yearonyear these annual declines were partly offset by good yearonyear performance in the industrial  iot and mobile endmarkets revenue in the industrial  iot end market was 1836 million a 15 increase while revenue in the mobile end market was 1248 million a 5 increase the revenue achieved in both the industrial  iot and the mobile end markets represent new alltime highs when aggregating all end markets the decrease in revenue was mostly related to lower sales to oems from a regional perspective revenue declined in emea americas and japan offset partly by greater china 

our gross profit percentage for 2020 decreased to 492 from 520 primarily due to the significant deceleration of revenue and the associated reduced manufacturing activity during the second and third quarters further amplified by the absorption of excess manufacturing fixed costs as a result of abnormal underloading in our frontend factories due to the covid19 pandemic 

revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 2507 million an increase of 11 sequentially from revenue for the third quarter of 2020 as the improving business environment emerging at the end of the third quarter continued into the fourth quarter from an end market perspective the increase sequentially was driven primarily by automotive with an 

increase of 24 and by mobile with an increase of 21 these increases were slightly offset by a decline of 13 in communication infrastructure  other and a decrease of 06 in industrial  iot 

we continue to generate strong operating cash flows with 2482 million in cash flows from operations for 2020 we returned 1047 million to our shareholders during the year in dividends and repurchases of common stock our cash position at the end of 2020 was 2275 million on november 19 2020 the nxp board of directors approved a cash dividend of 0375 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2020 

our global communities continue to face unprecedented challenges posed by the covid19 pandemic but nxp has continued to respond actively by addressing the covid19 situation and its impact globally with global crisis response teams working to mitigate the potential impacts to our people and our business with our strong business model and with demonstrated financial discipline which is a keystone of our culture we continue to believe that we will emerge from this time well positioned for longterm growth as we continue to see strong customer interest in the breadth of our product portfolio combined with solid design win awards however we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of this global pandemic or its ultimate impact on the global economy and our business and results 

demand has come back more rapidly than we expected and our current focus is to look after our customers and ensure we ship as much product to them as possible while we are encouraged by the rapid rebound in demand we are still challenged by the impact of the global pandemic we are still of the view that the best course of action is to continue to focus on enabling our customers success while simultaneously assuring the safety and health of all our employees 

results of operations 

the following table presents the composition of operating income for the years ended december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 



revenue 

revenue for the yearended december 31 2020 was 8612 million compared to 8877 million for the yearended december 31 2019 a decrease of 265 million or 3 the decrease is attributed to the impact of the covid19 pandemic in our primary endmarkets including yearonyear decreases in the automotive and in the communication infrastructure  other end markets these declines were partly offset by increases in the industrial  iot and mobile end markets 

revenue by endmarket was as follows 



revenue by sales channel was as follows 



revenue by geographic region which is based on the customer’s shippedto location was as follows 





revenue in the automotive end market declined 387 million yearonyear the decline was due to the covid19 pandemic which impacted automotive supply chains and resulted in many auto oems outside of china shutting car production sites primarily in europe and north america the yearonyear declines were most notable in our core automotive products which are more susceptible to variances in auto production rates including our mainstream auto processors advanced analog and sensor products 

revenue derived from the industrial  iot market increased 237 million yearonyear driven by the contribution of revenue associated with the recently acquired marvell wireless connectivity assets for connected iot solutions additionally revenue increased from higher demand for smart power high performance analog and generalpurpose microcontrollers primarily in the distribution channel in greater china 

within the mobile endmarket revenue increased 57 million yearonyear the increase was predominantly associated with continued customer adoption of secure mobile wallet solutions primarily to distributors in greater china as well as increased demand for embedded power solutions which increased sales to distributors mainly in greater china and oem sales in asia pacific these increases were offset by the divestment of voice and audio solutions which closed early in the first quarter of 2020 

revenue in the communication infrastructure  other end market declined 172 million yearonyear the decline was related to reduced demand in greater china and asia pacific for highperformance radio frequency hprf power amplifiers used in 4g cellular base stations offset by increased demand for network communication processors from distributors and oem customers in addition the overall decline was also offset by revenue related to the acquisition of the marvell wireless connectivity assets used in access solutions 

gross profit 

gross profit for the yearended december 31 2020 was 4235 million or 492 of revenue compared to 4618 million or 520 of revenue for the yearended december 31 2019 the decrease of 383 million was primarily driven by lower revenue and the reduced internal manufacturing activity during the second and third quarters further by with the absorption of excess manufacturing fixed costs as a result of abnormal underloading in our front 

end factories due to the covid19 crisis as well as the purchase accounting effect on inventory 17 million resulting from the marvell acquisition as a result the gross margin percentage decreased to 492 from 520 

operating expenses 

operating expenses for the yearended december 31 2020 totaled 3931 million or 456 of revenue compared to 4002 million or 451 of revenue for the yearended december 31 2019 

the following table below presents the composition of operating expenses by line item in the statement of operations 





the decrease in operating expenses was a result of the following items 

research and development rd costs primarily consist of engineer salaries and wages including share based compensation and other variable compensation engineering related costs including outside services fixedasset ip and other licenses related costs shared service center costs and other preproduction related expenses 

• rd costs for the yearended december 31 2020 increased by 82 million or 50 when compared to last year driven by 

 higher cost related to marvell activities which were acquired in the last month of 2019 

 higher restructuring costs 

 higher sharebased compensation expenses 

 higher preproduction related expenses 

 lower travel expenses 

 lower personnelrelated costs including variable compensation costs and 

 lower cost related to voice and audio solutions vas which was divested on february 3 2020 

selling general and administrative sga costs primarily consist of personnel salaries and wages including share based compensation and other variable compensation communication and it related costs fixedasset related costs and sales and marketing costs including travel expenses 

• sga costs for the yearended december 31 2020 decreased by 45 million or 49 when compared to last year mainly due to 

 lower sales and marketing costs 

 lower travel expenses 

 lower personnelrelated costs including variable compensation costs 

 lower professional services 

 higher restructuring costs and 

 higher sharebased compensation expenses as a result of the ceo transition 

• amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets decreased by 108 million or 75 when compared to last year driven by 

 certain intangibles became fully amortized during 2020 

 an impairment charge relative to iprd acquired as part of the acquisition of freescale and 

 the start of amortization of intangible assets related to the marvell acquisition 

other income expense 

income and expenses derived from manufacturing service arrangements “msa” and transitional service arrangements “tsa” that are put into place when we divest a business or activity are included in other income expense these arrangements are shortterm in nature and are expected to decrease as the divested business or activity becomes more established 

the following table presents the split of other income expense for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 



other income expense reflects income of 114 million for 2020 compared to 25 million of income in 2019 included in 2020 is 110 million relating to the net gain on the sale of the voice and audio solutions vas assets whereas the 2019 amount included 20 million relating to the sale of assets 

financial income expense 



financial income expense was an expense of 417 million in 2020 compared to an expense of 350 million in 2019 the change in financial income expense is primarily attributable to a decrease in interest income of 44 million as a result of a lower average cash level and lower interest rates and higher debt extinguishment costs in 2020 versus 2019 of 49 million this was partially offset by results on investments of 24 million 

benefit provision for income taxes 

we recorded an income tax benefit of 83 million for the yearended december 31 2020 which reflects an effective tax rate of 83000 compared to an expense of 20 million 69 for the yearended december 31 2019 



the effective tax rate reflects the impact of tax incentives a portion of our earnings being taxed in foreign jurisdictions at rates different than the netherlands statutory tax rate changes in estimates of prior years income taxes change in valuation allowance and nondeductible expenses sale of nondeductible goodwill and withholding taxes the impact of these items results in offsetting factors that attribute to the change in the effective tax rate between the two periods with the significant drivers outlined below 

• the company benefits from certain tax incentives which reduce the effective tax rate the dollar amount of the incentive in any given year is commensurate with the taxable income in that same period for 2020 the netherlands tax incentives was lower than 2019 by 20 million mainly due to the fact that nxp has a lower qualifying income 

• the difference in valuation allowance in 2020 as compared with 2019 is mainly due to the fact that there was less netherlands related interest expense impacted by the interest limitation rules as a result of higher qualifying income mainly linked to the divestiture of the vas business and the lower netherlands tax incentives 

• the tax effect of the nondeductible goodwill of 10 million is linked to the divestiture of the vas business in 2020 

• the difference of 36 million in the withholding tax benefit in 2020 as compared with 2019 is mainly due to changes in the applicable deferred tax liability rate regarding future remittances of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries and due to additional undistributed earnings being considered permanently reinvested 

• the change in estimates of prior years’ income taxes was higher in 2020 as compared to 2019 mostly relating to nxp usa 20 million primarily due to the early adoption of the us regulations issued in q3 2020 this was partly offset by other changes in estimates relating to multiple jurisdictions 

on a goforward basis cash payments for corporate income taxes that are relative to our ongoing operations are expected at a quarterly average of 76 million during 2021 our future cash payments for income taxes will also be impacted by nonrecurring events resulting in additional payments of 78 million in total which will be paid in 2021 

results relating to equityaccounted investees 

results relating to equityaccounted investees amounted to a loss of 4 million in 2020 whereas in 2019 results relating to equityaccounted investees amounted to a gain of 1 million 

noncontrolling interests 

noncontrolling interests are related to the thirdparty share in the results of consolidated companies predominantly ssmc their share of noncontrolling interests amounted to a profit of 28 million for the yearended december 31 2020 compared to a profit of 29 million for the yearended december 31 2019 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

thanks to our financial strength we expect to be able to maintain adequate liquidity as we manage through the current environment impacted by the covid19 pandemic over the years nxp has created a business that generates significant cash thanks to its large and diverse revenue stream we therefore believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs however we will continue to monitor evaluate and take action as necessary to preserve adequate liquidity and ensure that our business can continue to operate during these uncertain times we continue to successfully constrain discretionary spending across the organization reprioritizing our capital projects while simultaneously maintaining critical investments in areas that we believe will assure nxp’s longterm success 

we derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from our cash flows from operations we continue to generate strong positive operating cash flows as of december 31 2020 our cash balance was 2275 million an increase of 1230 million compared to december 31 2019 1045 million taking into account the available undrawn amount of the unsecured revolving credit facility the “rcf agreement” of 1500 million we had access to 3775 million of liquidity as of december 31 2020 

we currently use cash to fund operations meet working capital requirements for capital expenditures and for potential common stock repurchases dividends and strategic investments based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our current available sources of funds including cash and cash equivalents rcf agreement plus anticipated cash generated from operations will be adequate to finance our operations working capital requirements capital expenditures and potential dividends for at least the next year our capital expenditures were 392 million in 2020 compared to 526 million in 2019 

the common stock repurchase activity was as follows 



under dutch corporate law and our articles of association nxp may acquire its own shares if the general meeting of shareholders has granted the board of directors the authority to effect such acquisitions it is our standard practice to request our annual general meeting of shareholders the “agm” every year to renew this authorization for a period of 18 months from the agm for repurchases of shares in 2019 and 2020 the board of directors made use of the authorizations renewed by the agm on june 22 2018 june 17 2019 and may 27 2020 respectively in october 2018 the board of directors of nxp approved the repurchase of shares so long as the total number of shares held by nxp in treasury does not exceed 20 approximately 69 million shares of the number of shares issued and in november 2019 the board of directors approved the additional repurchase of shares up to a maximum of 2 billion during the fiscal yearended december 31 2019 nxp repurchased 159 million shares for a total of approximately 14 billion and during the fiscal yearended december 31 2020 nxp repurchased 48 million shares for a total of approximately 06 billion under dutch tax law the repurchase of a company’s shares by an entity domiciled in the netherlands results in a taxable event unless exemptions apply the tax on the repurchased shares is attributed to the shareholders with nxp making the payment on the shareholders’ behalf as such the tax on the repurchased shares is accounted for within stockholders’ equity

contractual obligations 

presented below is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2020 



1 as of december 31 2020 we had reserves of 175 million recorded for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties we are not including this amount in the longterm contractual obligations table presented because of the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements if any with the respective taxing authorities 

2 certain of these obligations are denominated in currencies other than us dollars and have been translated from foreign currencies into us dollars based on a period ending rate of 12280 per €100 in effect at december 31 2020 as a result the actual payments will vary based on any change in exchange rate 

in addition to the above obligations we enter into a variety of agreements in the normal course of business containing provisions that certain penalties may be charged if we do not fulfill our commitments it is not possible to predict with certainty the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar provisions due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular case historically payments pursuant to such provisions have not been material and we believe that any future payments required pursuant to such provisions would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition however such payments may be material to our consolidated statement of operations for a specific period 

we sponsor pension plans in many countries in accordance with legal requirements customs and the local situation in the countries involved these are definedbenefit pension plans defined contribution pension plans and multiemployer plans contributions to funded pension plans are made as necessary to provide sufficient assets to meet future benefits payable to plan participants these contributions are determined by various factors including funded status legal and tax considerations and local customs the expected cash outflows in 2021 and subsequent years are uncertain and may change as a consequence of statutory funding requirements as well as changes in actual versus currently assumed discount rates estimations of compensation increases and returns on pension plan assets 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with us gaap requires our management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes our management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience current economic and industry conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain our most critical accounting estimates include 

• the valuation of inventory which impacts gross margin 

• the assessment of recoverability of goodwill identified intangible assets and tangible fixed assets which impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization 

• revenue recognition which impacts our results of operations 

• the recognition of current and deferred income taxes including the measurement of uncertain tax positions which impacts our provision for income taxes 

• the assumptions used in the determination of postretirement benefit obligations which impacts operating expenses 

• the assumptions used in the determination of share based compensation which impacts gross margin and operating expenses and 

• the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies which impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we recognize a loss contingency or revise the estimates for a loss contingency 

in the following section we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved 

inventories 

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value we regularly review our inventories and write down our inventories for estimated losses due to obsolescence this allowance is determined for groups of products based on sales of our products in the recent past andor expected future demand future demand is affected by market conditions technological obsolescence new products and strategic plans each of which is subject to change with little or no forewarning in estimating obsolescence we utilize information that includes projecting future demand 

the need for strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive delivery performance to our customers are balanced against the risk of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 

the change in our reserves for inventories was primarily due to the normal review and accrual of obsolete or excess inventory if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by our management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

goodwill 

goodwill is required to be assessed for impairment at least once annually or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist which includes evaluating qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment of a reporting unit’s goodwill such events or changes in circumstances can be significant changes in business climate operating performance or competition or upon the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred between annual test dates we perform impairment tests using a fair value approach when necessary determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital and future economic and market conditions we base our fairvalue estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable actual cash flow amounts for future periods may differ from estimates used in impairment testing 

we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year we did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in the years presented as our annual impairment testing indicated that the fair value exceeded the recorded value for the respective reporting unit 

impairment or disposal of identified longlived assets 

we perform reviews of longlived assets including property plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than what we had originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable if such facts and circumstances exist we assess the recoverability of the longlived assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts in the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the assets or based on appraisals impairment losses if any are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets longlived assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or their estimated fair values less costs to sell and are not depreciated 

the assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other longlived assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by various factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines in 2020 we recognized impairment charges of 36 million relative to iprd that was acquired from freescale in 2019 and 2018 we had no impairments 

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenue under the core principle to depict the transfer of control to customers in an amount reflecting the consideration the company expects to be entitled in order to achieve that core principle the company applies the following five step approach 1 identify the contract with a customer 2 identify the performance obligations in the contract 3 determine the transaction price 4 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied 

the vast majority of the company’s revenue is derived from the sale of semiconductor products to distributors original equipment manufacturers “oems” and similar customers in determining the transaction price the company evaluates whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled variable consideration is estimated and includes the impact of discounts price protection product returns and distributor incentive programs the estimate of variable consideration is dependent on a variety of factors including contractual terms analysis of historical data current economic conditions industry demand and both the current and forecasted pricing environments the estimate of variable consideration is not constrained because the company has extensive experience with these contracts 

revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer ie when the company’s performance obligation is satisfied which typically occurs at shipment in determining whether 

control has transferred the company considers if there is a present right to payment and legal title and whether risks and rewards of ownership having transferred to the customer 

for sales to distributors revenue is recognized upon transfer of control to the distributor for some distributors contractual arrangements are in place which allow these distributors to return products if certain conditions are met these conditions generally relate to the time period during which a return is allowed and reflect customary conditions in the particular geographic market other return conditions relate to circumstances arising at the end of a product life cycle when certain distributors are permitted to return products purchased during a predefined period after the company has announced a product’s pending discontinuance these return rights are a form of variable consideration and are estimated using the most likely method based on historical return rates in order to reduce revenues recognized however long notice periods associated with these announcements prevent significant amounts of product from being returned for sales where return rights exist the company has determined based on historical data that only a very small percentage of the sales of this type to distributors is actually returned repurchase agreements with oems or distributors are not entered into by the company 

sales to most distributors are made under programs common in the semiconductor industry whereby distributors receive certain price adjustments to meet individual competitive opportunities these programs may include credits granted to distributors or allow distributors to return or scrap a limited amount of product in accordance with contractual terms agreed upon with the distributor or receive price protection credits when our standard published prices are lowered from the price the distributor paid for product still in its inventory in determining the transaction price the company considers the price adjustments from these programs to be variable consideration that reduce the amount of revenue recognized the company’s policy is to estimate such price adjustments using the most likely method based on rolling historical experience rates as well as a prospective view of products and pricing in the distribution channel for distributors who participate in our volume rebate incentive program we continually monitor the actual claimed allowances against our estimates and we adjust our estimates as appropriate to reflect trends in pricing environments and inventory levels the estimates are also adjusted when recent historical data does not represent anticipated future activity historically actual price adjustments for these programs relative to those estimated have not materially differed 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based upon the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled deferred tax liabilities for withholding taxes on dividends from subsidiaries are recognized in situations where the company does not consider the earnings indefinitely reinvested and to the extent that these withholding taxes are not expected to be refundable 

deferred tax assets including assets arising from loss carryforwards are recognized net of a valuation allowance if based upon the available evidence it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized 

the income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities the income tax benefit recognized is measured based on the largest benefit that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon resolution of the uncertainty unrecognized tax benefits are presented as a reduction to the deferred tax asset for related net operating loss carryforwards unless these would not be available in which case the uncertain tax benefits are presented together with the related interest and penalties as a liability under accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities based on the timing of the expected payment penalties are recorded as income tax expense whereas interest is reported as financial expense in the statement of operations 

postretirement benefits 

the company’s employees participate in pension and other postretirement benefit plans in many countries the costs of pension and other postretirement benefits and related assets and liabilities with respect to the company’s employees participating in definedbenefit plans are based upon actuarial valuations 

the projected definedbenefit obligation is calculated annually by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method for the company’s major plans the discount rate is derived from market yields on high quality corporate bonds plans in countries without a deep corporate bond market use a discount rate based on the local government bond rates 

in calculating obligation and expense the company is required to select actuarial assumptions these assumptions include discount rate expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation costs determined based on current market conditions historical information and consultation with and input from our actuaries changes in the key assumptions can have a significant impact to the projected benefit obligations funding requirements and periodic pension cost incurred 

the company determines the fair value of plan assets based on quoted prices or comparable prices for nonquoted assets for a definedbenefit pension plan the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation for any other postretirement defined benefit plan it is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 

sharebased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for all sharebased awards based on the grantdate estimated fair values net of an estimated forfeiture rate we use the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the estimated fair value for certain awards sharebased compensation cost for restricted share units “rsus” with timebased vesting is measured based on the closing fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant reduced by the present value of the estimated expected future dividends and then multiplied by the number of rsus granted sharebased compensation cost for performancebased share units “psus” granted with performance or market conditions is measured using a monte carlo simulation model on the date of grant 

our valuation models and generally accepted valuation techniques require us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards these assumptions and judgments include estimating the volatility of our stock price expected dividend yield employee turnover rates and employee stock option exercise behaviors when establishing the expected life assumption we used the ‘simplified’ method prescribed in asc topic 718 for companies that do not have adequate historical data the riskfree interest rate is measured as the prevailing yield for a us treasury security with a maturity similar to the expected life assumption we also estimate a forfeiture rate at the time of grant and revise this rate in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures or vesting differ from the original estimates 

we evaluate the assumptions used to value our awards on a quarterly basis if factors change and we employ different assumptions sharebased compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past if there are any modifications or cancellation of the underlying unvested securities we may be required to accelerate increase or cancel any remaining unearned sharebased compensation expense 

litigation and claims 

we are regularly involved as plaintiffs or defendants in claims and litigation related to our past and current business operations the claims can cover a broad range of topics including intellectual property reflecting the company’s identity as a global manufacturing and technology business the company vigorously defends itself against improper claims including those asserted in litigation due to the unpredictable nature of litigation there can be no assurance that the company’s accruals will be sufficient to cover the extent of its potential exposure to losses but historically legal actions have not had a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations or financial condition 

the estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is based on currently available information in relation to the claims that have arisen and on the company’s best estimate of such losses for those cases for which such estimate can be made for certain claims the company believes that an estimate cannot currently be made the estimated aggregate range requires significant judgment given the varying stages of the proceedings including the fact that many of them are currently in preliminary stages the existence of multiple defendants including the company in such claims whose share of liability has yet to be determined the numerous yetunresolved issues in many of the claims and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such claims accordingly the company’s estimate will change from time to time and actual losses may be more than the current estimate 

use of certain nongaap financial measures 

in addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with us gaap this document contains references to net debt net debt is a nongaap financial measure and represents total debt shortterm and longterm after deduction of cash and cash equivalents we believe this measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allows for greater transparency with respect to calculating our net leverage 

we understand that although net debt is used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluation of companies this concept has limitations as an analytical tool and it should not be used as an alternative to any other measure in accordance with us gaap 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates because we finance certain operations through fixed and variable rate debt instruments and denominate our transactions in a variety of foreign currencies changes in these rates may have an impact on future cash flow and earnings we manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

by using derivative instruments we are subject to credit and market risk the fair market value of the derivative instruments is determined by using valuation models whose inputs are derived using market observable inputs including interest rate yield curves as well as foreign exchange and commodity spot and forward rates and reflects the asset or liability position as of the end of each reporting period when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive the counterparty owes us thus creating a receivable risk for us we are exposed to counterparty credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our derivative agreements we minimize counterparty credit or repayment risk by entering into transactions with major financial institutions of investment grade credit rating our exposure to market risk is not hedged in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings or cash flow 

interest rate risk 

our rcf agreement has a 1500 million borrowing capacity with a floating rate interest as there are currently no borrowings under this facility a hypothetical increase in libor based interest rates would not have caused any change to our interest expense on our floating rate debt 

additional information regarding our notes is provided in note 2  significant accounting policies and note 14  debt of our notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report is incorporated herein by reference 

foreign currency risks 

we are also exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could affect operating results as well as our financial position and cash flows we monitor our exposures to these market risks and generally employ operating and financing activities to offset these exposures where appropriate if we do not have operating or financing activities to sufficiently offset these exposures from time to time we may employ derivative financial instruments such as swaps collars forwards options or other instruments to limit the 

volatility to earnings and cash flows generated by these exposures derivative financial instruments are only used for hedging purposes and not for trading or speculative purposes counterparties to our derivatives contracts are all major banking institutions in the event of financial insolvency or distress of a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments we may be unable to settle transactions if the counterparty does not provide us with sufficient collateral to secure its net settlement obligation to us which could have a negative impact on our results the company measures all derivative financial instruments based on fair values derived from market prices of the instruments or from option pricing models as appropriate and record these as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet changes in the fair values are recognized in the statement of operations immediately unless cash flow hedge accounting is applied a summary of our foreign currency accounting policies is provided in note 2  significant accounting policies of our notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report is incorporated herein by reference 

at december 31 2020 our net asset related to foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges of foreign currency risk on certain operating expenditure transactions was 18 million if our forecasted operating expenditures for currencies in which we hedge were to decline by 20 and foreign exchange rates were to change unfavorably by 20 in our hedged foreign currency we would incur a negligible loss 

financial assets and liabilities held by consolidated subsidiaries that are not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may affect reported earnings as a global company we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates we may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions as a result we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments 

our primary foreign currency exposure relates to the us dollar to euro exchange rate however our foreign currency exposures also relate but are not limited to the chinese yuan the japanese yen the pound sterling the malaysian ringgit the singapore dollar the taiwan dollar and the thailand baht

manufacturing 

we manufacture integrated circuits and discrete semiconductors through a combination of wholly owned manufacturing facilities a manufacturing facility operated jointly with another semiconductor company and thirdparty foundries and assembly and test subcontractors we manage our manufacturing assets together through one centralized organization to ensure we realize scale benefits in asset utilization purchasing volumes and overhead leverage across businesses 

in the future we expect to outsource an increased part of our internal demand for wafer foundry and packaging services to thirdparty manufacturing sources in order to increase our flexibility to accommodate increased demand 

the manufacturing of a semiconductor involves several phases of production which can be broadly divided into “frontend” and “backend” processes frontend processes take place at highly complex wafer manufacturing facilities called fabrication plants or “wafer fabs” and involve the imprinting of substrate silicon wafers with the precise circuitry required for semiconductors to function the frontend production cycle requires high levels of precision and involves as many as 300 process steps backend processes involve the assembly test and packaging of semiconductors in a form suitable for distribution in contrast to the highly complex frontend process backend processing is generally less complicated and as a result we tend to determine the location of our backend facilities based more on cost factors than on technical considerations 

we primarily focus our internal and joint venture wafer manufacturing operations on running proprietary specialty process technologies that enable us to differentiate our products on key performance features and we generally outsource wafer manufacturing in process technologies that are available at thirdparty wafer foundries when it is economical to do so in addition we increasingly focus our inhouse manufacturing on our competitive 8inch wafer facilities which predominantly run manufacturing processes in the 140 nanometer 180 nanometer and 250 nanometer process nodes this focus increases our return on invested capital and reduces capital expenditures 

our frontend manufacturing facilities use a broad range of production processes and proprietary design methods including complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos bipolar bipolar cmos bicmos and doublediffused metal on silicon oxide semiconductor dmos technologies our wafer fabs produce semiconductors with line widths ranging from 90 nanometers to 3 microns for integrated circuits and 05 microns to greater than 4 microns for discretes this broad technology portfolio enables us to meet increasing demand from customers for system solutions which require a variety of technologies 

our backend manufacturing facilities test and package many different types of products using a wide variety of processes to optimize flexibility we use shared technology platforms for our backend assembly operations most of our assembly and test activities are maintained inhouse 

the following table shows selected key information with respect to our major frontend and backend facilities 

1joint venture with tsmc we are entitled to 60 of the joint venture’s annual capacity 

we use a large number of raw materials in our front and backend manufacturing processes including silicon wafers chemicals gases lead frames substrates molding compounds and various types of precious and other metals our most important raw materials are the raw or substrate silicon wafers we use to make our semiconductors we purchase these wafers which must meet exacting specifications from a limited number of suppliers in the geographic region in which our fabrication facilities are located at our wholly owned fabrication plants we use raw wafers ranging from 6 inches to 8 inches in size our ssmc wafer fab facility which produces 8 inch wafers is jointly owned by tsmc and ourselves emerging fabrication technologies employ larger wafer sizes and accordingly we expect that our production requirements will in the future shift towards larger substrate wafers 

we typically source our other raw materials in a similar fashion as our wafers although our portfolio of suppliers is more diverse some of our suppliers provide us with materials on a justintime basis which permits us to reduce our procurement costs and the negative cash flow consequences of maintaining inventories but exposes us to potential supply chain interruptions we purchase most of our raw materials on the basis of fixed price contracts but generally do not commit ourselves to longterm purchase obligations which permits us to renegotiate prices periodically 

sales marketing and customers 

we market our products and solutions worldwide to a variety of oems original design manufacturers odms contract manufacturers and distributors we generate demand for our products by delivering product solutions to our customers and supporting their system designin activities by providing application architecture expertise and local field application engineering support 

our sales and marketing teams are organized into five regions which are emea europe the middle east and africa the americas japan south korea and greater china including asia pacific these sales regions 

are responsible for managing customer relationships and creating demand for our solutions through the full ecosystem development including our distributors and at our large number of mass market customers 

our sales and marketing strategy focuses on key defined verticals in automotive mobile industrial and iot and communication infrastructure deepening our relationship with our top oems and electronic manufacturing service customers expanding our reach to our mass market customers startups and our distribution partners and becoming their preferred supplier which we believe assists us in reducing sales volatility in challenging markets we have longstanding customer relationships with most of our customers our 10 largest oem end customers some of whom are supplied by distributors in alphabetical order are apple bosch continental denso delphi ericsson huawei lg samsung and zte we also have a strong position with our distribution partners including our three largest arrow avnet and nexty 

our revenue is primarily the sum of our direct sales to oems plus our distributors’ resale of nxp products avnet accounted for 14 of our revenue in 2019 and 14 in 2018 arrow accounted for less than 10 of our revenue in 2019 and 10 in 2018 no other distributor accounted for greater than 10 of our revenue with 11 of total revenue in both 2019 and 2018 continental was the only oem to which we had direct sales that accounted for more than 10 of revenue in 2019 and 2018 

see note 23 “segments and geographical information” to the consolidated financial statements for a breakdown of total revenue by segment and geographic market for the last three financial years 

research and development 

we believe that our future success depends on our ability to both improve our existing products and to develop new products for both existing and new markets we direct our research and development efforts largely to the development of new semiconductor solutions where we see significant opportunities for growth we target applications that require stringent overall system and subsystem performance as new and challenging applications proliferate we believe that many of these applications will benefit from our solutions we have assembled a global team of highly skilled semiconductor and embedded software design engineers with expertise in rf analog power management interface security and digital processing as of december 31 2019  we had 8808 employees in research and development 

to outpace market growth we invest in research and development to extend or create leading market positions with an emphasis on fast growing sizable market segments such as adas invehicle networks and power management as well as edge computing to support the successful deployment in the iot with our crossover processing technology but also in emerging markets such as massive mimo in rf power and mmwave for 5g in addition we invest a few percent of our total research and development expenditures in research activities that develop fundamental new technologies or product categories that could contribute significantly to our company growth in the future 

we annually perform a fundamental review of our business portfolio and our related new product and technology development opportunities in order to decide on changes in the allocation of our research and development resources for products targeting established markets we evaluate our research and development expenditures based on clear business need and risk assessments for breakthrough technologies and new market opportunities we look at the strategic fit and synergies with the rest of our portfolio and the size of the potential addressable market overall we allocate our research and development to maintain a healthy mix of emerging growth and mature businesses 

intellectual property 

the creation and use of intellectual property is a key aspect of our strategy to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace we seek to protect our proprietary technologies by obtaining patents trademarks domain names retaining trade secrets and defending enforcing and utilizing our intellectual property rights where appropriate we believe this strategy allows us to preserve the advantages of our products and technologies and helps us to improve the return on our investment in research and development we have a broad portfolio of close to 10000 patent families each patent family includes all patents and patent applications originating from the same 

invention to protect confidential technical information and software we rely on copyright and trade secret law and enter into confidentiality agreements as applicable in situations where we believe that a third party has infringed on our intellectual property we enforce our rights through all available legal means to the extent that we determine the benefits of such actions to outweigh the costs and risks involved 

we own a number of trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business where we consider it desirable we develop names for our new products and secure trademark protection our trademarks allow us to further distinguish our company and our products and are important in our relationships with customers suppliers partners and endusers 

while our patents trademarks trade secrets and other intellectual property rights constitute valuable assets we do not view any individual right or asset as material to our operations as a whole we believe it is the combination of our proprietary technology patents knowhow and other intellectual property rights and assets that creates an advantage for our business 

in addition to obtaining our own patents and other intellectual property rights we have entered into licensing agreements and other arrangements authorizing us to use intellectual property rights confidential technical information software and other technology owned by third parties we also engage in certain instances in licensing and selling of certain of our technology patents and other intellectual property rights 

competition 

we compete with many different semiconductor companies including multinational companies with integrated research and development manufacturing sales and marketing organizations across a broad spectrum of product lines “fabless” semiconductor companies and companies that are focused on a single application market segment or standard product most of these competitors compete with us with respect to some but not all of our businesses 

our key competitors in alphabetical order include analog devices inc infineon technologies ag maxim integrated products inc microchip technology inc nordic semiconductor asa power integrations inc qualcomm inc renesas electronics corp silicon laboratories stmicroelectronics nv and texas instruments incorporated 

the basis on which we compete varies across end markets and geographic regions this includes competing on the basis of our ability to timely develop new products and the underlying intellectual property and on meeting customer requirements in terms of cost product features quality warranty and availability in addition our system solutions businesses require indepth knowledge of a given application market in order to develop robust system solutions and qualified customer support resources 

seasonality

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business 

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical 

historically the relationship between supply and demand in the semiconductor industry has caused a high degree of cyclicality in the semiconductor market semiconductor supply is partly driven by manufacturing capacity which in the past has demonstrated alternating periods of substantial capacity additions and periods in which no or limited capacity was added as a general matter semiconductor companies are more likely to add 

capacity in periods when current or expected future demand is strong and margins are or are expected to be high investments in new capacity can result in overcapacity which can lead to a reduction in prices and margins in response companies typically limit further capacity additions eventually causing the market to be relatively undersupplied in addition demand for semiconductors varies which can exacerbate the effect of supply fluctuations as a result of this cyclicality the semiconductor industry has in the past experienced significant downturns such as in 19971998 20012002 and in 20082009 often in connection with or in anticipation of maturing life cycles of semiconductor companies’ products and declines in general economic conditions these downturns have been characterized by diminishing demand for enduser products high inventory levels underutilization of manufacturing capacity and accelerated erosion of average selling prices the foregoing risks have historically had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

significantly increased volatility and instability and unfavorable economic conditions may adversely affect our business 

in 2008 and 2009 europe the united states and international markets experienced increased volatility and instability in 2015 volatility and instability in financial markets continued following renewed investor concerns related to the economic situation in parts of the world a decline in the growth rate of the chinese economy increased hostilities in the middle east and other world events these or other events could further adversely affect the economies of the european union the united states and those of other countries and may exacerbate the cyclicality of our business among other factors we face risks attendant to unfavorable changes related to interest rates rates of economic growth fiscal monetary and trade policies of governments tax rates and policy and changes in demand for enduser products and changes in interest rates 

there is a significant risk that the global economy could fall into recession again if economic conditions remain uncertain or deteriorate our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

it is difficult for us our customers and suppliers to forecast demand trends we may be unable to accurately predict the extent or duration of cycles or their effect on our financial condition or result of operations and can give no assurance as to the timing extent or duration of the current or future business cycles a recurrent decline in demand or the failure of demand to return to prior levels could place pressure on our results of operations the timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market conditions is uncertain and supply and demand may be unbalanced at any time 

the semiconductor industry is highly competitive if we fail to introduce new technologies and products in a timely manner this could adversely affect our business 

the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and characterized by constant and rapid technological change short product lifecycles significant price erosion and evolving standards accordingly the success of our business depends to a significant extent on our ability to develop new technologies and products that are ultimately successful in the market the costs related to the research and development necessary to develop new technologies and products are significant and any reduction of our research and development budget could harm our competitiveness meeting evolving industry requirements and introducing new products to the market in a timely manner and at prices that are acceptable to our customers are significant factors in determining our competitiveness and success commitments to develop new products must be made well in advance of any resulting sales and technologies and standards may change during development potentially rendering our products outdated or uncompetitive before their introduction if we are unable to successfully develop new products our revenue may decline substantially moreover some of our competitors are wellestablished entities are larger than us and have greater resources than we do if these competitors increase the resources they devote to developing and marketing their products we may not be able to compete effectively any consolidation among our competitors could enhance their product offerings and financial resources further strengthening their competitive position in addition some of our competitors operate in narrow business areas relative to us allowing them to concentrate their research and development efforts directly on products and services for those areas which may give them a competitive advantage as a result of these competitive pressures we may face declining sales volumes or lower prevailing prices for our products and we may not be able to reduce our total 

costs in line with this declining revenue if any of these risks materialize they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in many of the market segments in which we compete we depend on winning selection processes and failure to be selected could adversely affect our business in those market segments 

one of our business strategies is to participate in and win competitive bid selection processes to develop products for use in our customers’ equipment and products these selection processes can be lengthy and require us to incur significant design and development expenditures with no guarantee of winning a contract or generating revenue failure to win new design projects and delays in developing new products with anticipated technological advances or in commencing volume shipments of these products may have an adverse effect on our business this risk is particularly pronounced in markets where there are only a few potential customers and in the automotive market where due to the longer design cycles involved failure to win a designin could prevent access to a customer for several years our failure to win a sufficient number of these bids could result in reduced revenue and hurt our competitive position in future selection processes because we may not be perceived as being a technology or industry leader each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the demand for our products depends to a significant degree on the demand for our customers’ end products 

the vast majority of our revenue is derived from sales to manufacturers in the automotive industrial  iot mobile and communication infrastructure demand in these markets fluctuates significantly driven by consumer spending consumer preferences the development of new technologies and prevailing economic conditions in addition the specific products in which our semiconductors are incorporated may not be successful or may experience price erosion or other competitive factors that affect the price manufacturers are willing to pay us such customers have in the past and may in the future vary order levels significantly from period to period request postponements to scheduled delivery dates modify their orders or reduce lead times this is particularly common during periods of low demand this can make managing our business difficult as it limits the predictability of future revenue it can also affect the accuracy of our financial forecasts furthermore developing industry trends including customers’ use of outsourcing and new and revised supply chain models may affect our revenue costs and working capital requirements additionally a significant portion of our products is made to order 

if customers do not purchase products made specifically for them we may not be able to resell such products to other customers or may not be able to require the customers who have ordered these products to pay a cancellation fee the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by continued price erosion especially after a product has been on the market 

one of the results of the rapid innovation in the semiconductor industry is that pricing pressure especially on products containing older technology can be intense product life cycles are relatively short and as a result products tend to be replaced by more technologically advanced substitutes on a regular basis 

in turn demand for older technology falls causing the price at which such products can be sold to drop in some cases precipitously in order to continue profitably supplying these products we must reduce our production costs in line with the lower revenue we can expect to generate per unit usually this must be accomplished through improvements in process technology and production efficiencies if we cannot advance our process technologies or improve our efficiencies to a degree sufficient to maintain required margins we will no longer be able to make a profit from the sale of these products moreover we may not be able to cease production of such products either due to contractual obligations or for customer relationship reasons and as a result may be required to bear a loss on such products we cannot guarantee that competition in our core product markets will not lead to price erosion lower revenue or lower margins in the future should reductions in our manufacturing costs fail to keep pace with reductions in market prices for the products we sell this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets 

goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition as a result of our acquisition of marvell’s wireless wifi connectivity business unit bluetooth technology portfolio and related assets in 2019 we recognized goodwill of 11 billion and intangible assets of 05 billion as a result of our acquisition of freescale in 2015 we recognized goodwill of 74 billion and intangible assets of 85 billion we review our goodwill and other intangible assets balance for impairment upon any indication of a potential impairment and in the case of goodwill at a minimum of once a year impairment may result from among other things a sustained decrease in share price deterioration in performance adverse market conditions adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including changes that restrict the activities of or affect the products and services we sell challenges to the validity of certain registered intellectual property reduced sales of certain products incorporating intellectual property and a variety of other factors the amount of any quantified impairment must be expensed immediately as a charge to results of operations depending on future circumstances it is possible that we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets any future determination of impairment of goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and stockholders’ equity 

as our business is global we need to comply with laws and regulations in countries across the world and are exposed to international business risks that could adversely affect our business 

we operate globally with manufacturing assembly and testing facilities in several continents and we market our products globally 

as a result we are subject to environmental labor and health and safety laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate we are also required to obtain environmental permits and other authorizations or licenses from governmental authorities for certain of our operations in the jurisdictions where we operate we need to comply with differing standards and varying practices of regulatory tax judicial and administrative bodies 

in addition the business environment is also subject to many economic and political uncertainties including the following international business risks 

 

no assurance can be given that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with the laws and regulations to which we are subject or that we have obtained or will obtain the permits and other authorizations or licenses that we need if we violate or fail to comply with laws regulations permits and other authorizations or licenses we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators furthermore if one or more of our customers are sanctioned by regulators for noncompliance with laws and regulations we could experience a decrease in demand for our products for example import and export regulations such as the us 

export administration regulations administered by the us department of commerce are complex change frequently have generally become more stringent over time and have intensified under the current us administration if our customers or suppliers fail to comply with these regulations we may be required to suspend activities with these customers or suppliers which could negatively impact our results of operations additionally we may be required to incur significant expense to comply with or to remedy violations of these regulations in this case or if any of the international business risks were to materialize or become worse they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies further increasing legal and financial compliance costs these laws regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity and as a result their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure 

interruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology applications systems and networks to operate our business the reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure and software and our ability to expand and continually update technologies in response to our changing needs is critical to our business any significant interruption in our business applications systems or networks including but not limited to new system implementations computer viruses cyberattacks security breaches facility issues or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our computer systems and networks are subject to attempted security breaches and other cybersecurity incidents which if successful could impact our business 

we have from time to time experienced cyberattacks attempting to obtain access to our computer systems and networks such incidents whether or not successful could result in the misappropriation of our proprietary information and technology the compromise of personal and confidential information of our employees customers or suppliers or interrupt our business for instance in january 2020 we became aware of a compromise of certain of our systems we are taking steps to identify the malicious activity and are implementing remedial measures to increase the security of our systems and networks to respond to evolving threats and new information as of the date of this filing we do not believe that this it system compromise has resulted in a material adverse effect on our business or any material damage to us however the investigation is ongoing and we are continuing to evaluate the amount and type of data compromised there can be no assurance that this or any other breach or incident will not have a material impact on our operations and financial results in the future in the current environment there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy including criminal hackers statesponsored intrusions industrial espionage employee malfeasance and human or technological error computer hackers and others routinely attempt to breach the security of technology products services and systems and those of customers suppliers and some of those attempts may be successful such breaches could result in for example unauthorized access to disclosure modification misuse loss or destruction of our our customer or other third party data or systems theft of sensitive or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property system disruptions and denial of service in the event of such breaches we our customers or other third parties could be exposed to potential liability litigation and regulatory action as well as the loss of existing or potential customers damage to our reputation and other financial loss in addition the cost and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant as these threats continue to develop and grow we have been adapting our security measures and we continue to increase the amount we allocate to implement maintain andor update security systems to protect data and infrastructure as a global enterprise we could also be impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity privacy and data protection additionally cyberattacks or other catastrophic events resulting in disruptions to or failures in power information technology communication systems or other critical infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to us our customers or other third party operations or services financial loss potential liability and damage our reputation and affect our relationships with our customers and suppliers 

in addition we may be subject to theft loss or misuse of personal data about our employees customers or other third parties which could increase our expenses damage our reputation or result in legal or regulatory proceedings the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims global privacy legislation enforcement and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment costs to comply with and implement these privacyrelated and data protection measures could be significant in addition even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others 

in difficult market conditions our high fixed costs combined with low revenue may negatively affect our results of operations 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by high fixed costs and notwithstanding our utilization of thirdparty manufacturing capacity most of our production requirements are met by our own manufacturing facilities in less favorable industry environments like we faced in the second half in 2011 we are generally faced with a decline in the utilization rates of our manufacturing facilities due to decreases in demand for our products during such periods our fabrication plants could operate at lower loading level while the fixed costs associated with the full capacity continue to be incurred resulting in lower gross profit 

the semiconductor industry is capital intensive and if we are unable to invest the necessary capital to operate and grow our business we may not remain competitive 

to remain competitive we must constantly improve our facilities and process technologies and carry out extensive research and development all of which requires investment of significant amounts of capital this risk is magnified by the indebtedness we currently have since we are required to use a portion of our cash flow to service that debt if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or raise sufficient capital to meet both our debt service and capital investment requirements or if we are unable to raise required capital on favorable terms when needed this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely to a significant extent on proprietary intellectual property we may not be able to protect this intellectual property against improper use by our competitors or others 

our success and future revenue growth depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology our products our proprietary designs and fabrication processes and other intellectual property against misappropriation by others we primarily rely on patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our intellectual property we may have difficulty obtaining patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our proprietary products technology and intellectual property and the patents and other intellectual property rights we receive may be insufficient to provide us with meaningful protection or commercial advantage we may not obtain patent protection or secure other intellectual property rights in all the countries in which we operate and under the laws of such countries patents and other intellectual property rights may be or become unavailable or limited in scope even if new patents are issued the claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to effectively protect our proprietary technology processes and other intellectual property in addition any of our existing patents and any future patents issued to us may be challenged invalidated or circumvented the protection offered by intellectual property rights may be inadequate or weakened for reasons or circumstances that are out of our control further our proprietary technology designs and processes and other intellectual property may be vulnerable to disclosure or misappropriation by employees contractors and other persons it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain copy use or disclose our proprietary technologies our products designs processes and other intellectual property despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property while we hold a significant number of patents there can be no assurances that additional patents will be issued or that any rights granted under our patents will provide meaningful protection against misappropriation of our intellectual property our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents we may not have or pursue patents or pending applications in all the countries in which we operate corresponding to all of our primary patents and applications even if patents are granted effective enforcement in some countries may not be available in particular intellectual property rights are difficult to enforce in countries where the application and enforcement of the laws governing such rights may not have reached the same level as compared to other jurisdictions where we operate consequently operating in some countries may 

subject us to an increased risk that unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise use our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our suppliers or other parties with whom we engage there is no assurance that we will be able to protect our intellectual property rights or have adequate legal recourse in the event that we seek legal or judicial enforcement of our intellectual property rights under the laws of such countries any inability on our part to adequately protect our intellectual property may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may become party to intellectual property claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products 

we have from time to time received and may in the future receive communications alleging possible infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights of others further we may become involved in costly litigation brought against us regarding patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets or other intellectual property rights if any such claims are asserted against us we may seek to obtain a license under the third party’s intellectual property rights we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain any or all of the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms if at all in the event that we cannot obtain or take the view that we don’t need a license these parties may file lawsuits against us seeking damages and potentially treble damages in the united states or an injunction against the sale of our products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presently conducted such lawsuits if successful could result in an increase in the costs of selling certain of our products our having to partially or completely redesign our products or stop the sale of some of our products and could cause damage to our reputation any litigation could require significant financial and management resources regardless of the merits or outcome and we cannot assure you that we would prevail in any litigation or that our intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged the award of damages including material royalty payments or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products could affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we may rely on strategic partnerships joint ventures and alliances for manufacturing and research and development however we often do not control these partnerships and joint ventures and actions taken by any of our partners or the termination of these partnerships or joint ventures could adversely affect our business 

as part of our strategy we have historically entered into a number of longterm strategic partnerships with other leading industry participants and may do so again in the future for example we currently participate in a joint venture with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited “tsmc” called systems on silicon manufacturing company pte ltd “ssmc” 

if any of our strategic partners in alliances we currently engage with or may engage with in the future were to encounter financial difficulties or change their business strategies they may no longer be able or willing to participate in these groups or alliances which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations under the terms of current or future alliances we may have certain obligations including funding obligations or take or pay obligations for example we have made certain commitments to ssmc in which we have a 612 ownership share whereby we are obligated to make cash payments to ssmc should we fail to utilize and tsmc does not utilize an agreed upon percentage of the total available capacity at ssmc’s fabrication facilities if overall ssmc utilization levels drop below a fixed proportion of the total available capacity 

we may from time to time desire to exit certain product lines or businesses or to restructure our operations but may not be successful in doing so 

from time to time we may decide to divest certain product lines and businesses or restructure our operations including through the contribution of assets to joint ventures we have in recent years exited several of our product lines and businesses and we have closed several of our manufacturing and research facilities we may continue to do so in the future however our ability to successfully exit product lines and businesses or to close or consolidate operations depends on a number of factors many of which are outside of our control for example if we are seeking a buyer for a particular business line none may be available or we may not be successful in negotiating satisfactory terms with prospective buyers in addition we may face internal obstacles 

to our efforts in particular several of our operations and facilities are subject to collective bargaining agreements and social plans or require us to consult with our employee representatives such as work councils which may prevent or complicate our efforts to sell or restructure our businesses in some cases particularly with respect to our european operations there may be laws or other legal impediments affecting our ability to carry out such sales or restructuring 

if we are unable to exit a product line or business in a timely manner or to restructure our operations in a manner we deem to be advantageous this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations even if a divestment is successful we may face indemnity and other liability claims by the acquirer or other parties 

we may from time to time restructure parts of our organization any such restructuring may impact customer satisfaction and the costs of implementation may be difficult to predict 

between 2008 and 2011 we executed a redesign program and in 2013 we executed a restructuring initiative designed to improve operational efficiency and to competitively position the company for sustainable growth in 2015 we began a restructuring initiative to prepare for and implement the integration of freescale into our existing businesses we plan to continue to restructure and make changes to parts of the processes in our organization furthermore if the global economy remains volatile or if the global economy reenters a recession our revenues could decline and we may be forced to take additional cost savings steps that could result in additional charges and materially affect our business the costs of implementing any restructurings changes or cost savings steps may differ from our estimates and any negative impacts on our revenues or otherwise of such restructurings changes or steps such as situations in which customer satisfaction is negatively impacted may be larger than originally estimated 

if we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements and social plans with our labor unions as they expire from time to time if regular or statutory consultation processes with employee representatives such as works councils fail or are delayed or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage our business and operating results could be materially harmed 

we are a party to collective bargaining agreements and social plans with our labor unions we are also required to consult with our employee representatives such as works councils on items such as restructurings acquisitions and divestitures although we believe that our relations with our employees employee representatives and unions are satisfactory no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate these agreements as they expire from time to time or to conclude the consultation processes in a timely and favorable way the impact of future negotiations and consultation processes with employee representatives could have a material impact on our financial results also if we fail to extend or renegotiate our labor agreements and social plans if significant disputes with our unions arise or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage we could incur higher ongoing labor costs or experience a significant disruption of operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our working capital needs are difficult to predict 

our working capital needs are difficult to predict and may fluctuate the comparatively long period between the time at which we commence development of a product and the time at which it may be delivered to a customer leads to high inventory and workinprogress levels the volatility of our customers’ own businesses and the time required to manufacture products also makes it difficult to manage inventory levels and requires us to stockpile products across many different specifications 

our business may be adversely affected by costs relating to product defects and we could be faced with product liability and warranty claims 

we make highly complex electronic components and accordingly there is a risk that defects may occur in any of our products such defects can give rise to significant costs including expenses relating to recalling products replacing defective items writing down defective inventory and loss of potential sales in addition the occurrence of such defects may give rise to product liability and warranty claims including liability for damages caused by such defects if we release defective products into the market our reputation could suffer and we may lose sales opportunities and incur liability for damages moreover since the cost of replacing defective 

semiconductor devices is often much higher than the value of the devices themselves we may at times face damage claims from customers in excess of the amounts they pay us for our products including consequential damages we also face exposure to potential liability resulting from the fact that our customers typically integrate the semiconductors we sell into numerous consumer products which are then sold into the marketplace we are exposed to product liability claims if our semiconductors or the consumer products based on them malfunction and result in personal injury or death we may be named in product liability claims even if there is no evidence that our products caused the damage in question and such claims could result in significant costs and expenses relating to attorneys’ fees and damages in addition our customers may recall their products if they prove to be defective or make compensatory payments in accordance with industry or business practice or in order to maintain good customer relationships if such a recall or payment is caused by a defect in one of our products our customers may seek to recover all or a portion of their losses from us if any of these risks materialize our reputation would be harmed and there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business has suffered and could in the future suffer from manufacturing problems 

we manufacture in our own factories as well as with third parties our products using processes that are highly complex require advanced and costly equipment and must continuously be modified to improve yields and performance difficulties in the production process can reduce yields or interrupt production and as a result of such problems we may on occasion not be able to deliver products or do so in a timely or costeffective or competitive manner as the complexity of both our products and our fabrication processes has become more advanced manufacturing tolerances have been reduced and requirements for precision have become more demanding as is common in the semiconductor industry we have in the past experienced manufacturing difficulties that have given rise to delays in delivery and quality control problems there can be no assurance that any such occurrence in the future would not materially harm our results of operations further we may suffer disruptions in our manufacturing operations either due to production difficulties such as those described above or as a result of external factors beyond our control we may in the future experience manufacturing difficulties or permanent or temporary loss of manufacturing capacity due to the preceding or other risks any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on the timely supply of equipment and materials and could suffer if suppliers fail to meet their delivery obligations or raise prices certain equipment and materials needed in our manufacturing operations are only available from a limited number of suppliers 

our manufacturing operations depend on deliveries of equipment and materials in a timely manner and in some cases on a justintime basis from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit the amounts supplied to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors supply disruptions may also occur due to shortages in critical materials such as silicon wafers or specialized chemicals because the equipment that we purchase is complex it is frequently difficult or impossible for us to substitute one piece of equipment for another or replace one type of material with another a failure by our suppliers to deliver our requirements could result in disruptions to our manufacturing operations our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of quality equipment or materials in a timely manner or if there are significant increases in the costs of equipment or materials 

failure of our third party suppliers to perform could adversely affect our ability to exploit growth opportunities 

we currently use outside suppliers for a portion of our manufacturing capacity outsourcing our production presents a number of risks if our outside suppliers are unable to satisfy our demand or experience manufacturing difficulties delays or reduced yields our results of operations and ability to satisfy customer demand could suffer in addition purchasing rather than manufacturing these products may adversely affect our gross profit margin if the purchase costs of these products are higher than our own manufacturing costs would have been prices for foundry products also vary depending on capacity utilization rates at our suppliers quantities demanded product technology and geometry furthermore these outsourcing costs can vary materially from quarter to quarter and in cases of industry shortages they can increase significantly negatively affecting our gross profit 

loss of our key management and other personnel or an inability to attract such management and other personnel could affect our business 

we depend on our key management to run our business and on our senior engineers to develop new products and technologies our success will depend on the continued service of these individuals although we have several share based compensation plans in place we cannot be sure that these plans will help us in our ability to retain key personnel especially considering that the stock options under some of our plans become exercisable upon a change of control in particular when a third party or third parties acting in concert obtains whether directly or indirectly control of us the loss of any of our key personnel whether due to departures death ill health or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business the market for qualified employees including skilled engineers and other individuals with the required technical expertise to succeed in our business is highly competitive and the loss of qualified employees or an inability to attract retain and motivate the additional highly skilled employees required for the operation and expansion of our business could hinder our ability to successfully conduct research activities or develop marketable products the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business 

disruptions in our relationships with any one of our key customers could adversely affect our business 

a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from our top customers including our distributors we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate similar levels of revenue from our largest customers in the future if one or more of these customers substantially reduce their purchases from us this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we receive subsidies and grants in certain countries and a reduction in the amount of governmental funding available to us or demands for repayment could increase our costs and affect our results of operations 

as is the case with other large semiconductor companies we receive subsidies and grants from governments in some countries these programs are subject to periodic review by the relevant governments and if any of these programs are curtailed or discontinued this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as the availability of government funding is outside our control we cannot guarantee that we will continue to benefit from government support or that sufficient alternative funding will be available if we lose such support moreover if we terminate any activities or operations including strategic alliances or joint ventures we may face adverse actions from the local governmental agencies providing such subsidies to us in particular such government agencies could seek to recover such subsidies from us and they could cancel or reduce other subsidies we receive from them this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

legal proceedings covering a range of matters are pending in various jurisdictions due to the uncertainty inherent in litigation it is difficult to predict the final outcome an adverse outcome might affect our results of operations 

we and certain of our businesses are involved as plaintiffs or defendants in legal proceedings in various matters for example we are involved in legal proceedings claiming personal injuries to the children of former employees as a result of employees’ alleged exposure to chemicals used in semiconductor manufacturing clean room environments operated by us or our former parent companies philips and motorola furthermore because we continue to utilize these clean rooms we may become subject to future claims alleging personal injury that may lead to additional liability a judgment against us or material defense cost could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to a variety of financial risks including currency risk interest rate risk liquidity risk commodity price risk credit risk and other noninsured risks which may have an adverse effect on our financial results 

we are a global company and as a direct consequence movements in the financial markets may impact our financial results we are exposed to a variety of financial risks including currency fluctuations interest rate risk liquidity risk commodity price risk and credit risk and other noninsured risks we have eurodenominated assets and liabilities and since our reporting currency is the us dollar the impact of currency translation adjustments to such assets and liabilities may have a negative effect on our stockholders’ equity we continue to hold or convert a part of our cash in euros as a hedge for euro expenses and euro interest payments we are 

exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates when we convert us dollars to euro we enter into diverse financial transactions with several counterparties to mitigate our currency risk we only use derivative instruments for hedging purposes 

we are also a purchaser of certain base metals precious metals chemicals and energy used in the manufacturing process of our products the prices of which can be volatile credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed to perform upon their agreed payment obligations credit risk is present within our trade receivables such exposure is reduced through ongoing credit evaluations of the financial conditions of our customers and by adjusting payment terms and credit limits when appropriate we invest available cash and cash equivalents with various financial institutions and are in that respect exposed to credit risk with these counterparties we actively manage concentration risk on a daily basis adhering to a treasury management policy we seek to limit the financial institutions with which we enter into financial transactions such as depositing cash to those with a strong credit rating wherever possible if we are unable to successfully manage these risks they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the impact of a negative performance of financial markets and demographic trends on our defined benefit pension liabilities and costs cannot be predicted 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans in a number of countries and a significant number of our employees are covered by our defined benefit pension plans as of december 31 2019 we had recognized a net accrued benefit liability of 462 million representing the unfunded benefit obligations of our defined pension plans the funding status and the liabilities and costs of maintaining these defined benefit pension plans may be impacted by financial market developments for example the accounting for such plans requires determining discount rates expected rates of compensation and expected returns on plan assets and any changes in these variables can have a significant impact on the projected benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs negative performance of the financial markets could also have a material impact on funding requirements and net periodic pension costs our defined benefit pension plans may also be subject to demographic trends accordingly our costs to meet pension liabilities going forward may be significantly higher than they are today which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 

future changes to dutch us and other foreign tax laws could adversely affect us 

the european commission us congress and treasury department the organization for economic cooperation and development and other government agencies in jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations particularly payments made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates as a result the tax laws in the european union us and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could adversely affect us and our affiliates 

recent examples include the organization for economic cooperation and development’s initiatives to revise profit allocation and nexus rules to allocate more taxing rights to countries where companies have their markets and to establish a minimum tax rate on a global basis these initiatives include recommendations and proposals that if enacted in countries in which we and our affiliates do business could adversely affect us and our affiliates 

we are exposed to a number of different tax uncertainties which could have an impact on our results 

we are required to pay taxes in multiple jurisdictions we determine the taxes we are required to pay based on our interpretation of the applicable tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we may be subject to unfavorable changes in the respective tax laws and regulations to which we are subject tax controls audits change in controls and changes in tax laws or regulations or the interpretation given to them may expose us to negative tax consequences including interest payments and potentially penalties we have issued transferpricing directives in the areas of goods services and financing which are in accordance with the guidelines of the organization of economic cooperation and development oecd as transfer pricing has a cross border effect the focus of local tax authorities on implemented transfer pricing procedures in a country may have an impact on results in another country 

transfer pricing uncertainties can also result from disputes with local tax authorities about transfer pricing of internal deliveries of goods and services or related to financing acquisitions and divestments the use of tax credits and permanent establishments and tax losses carried forward these uncertainties may have a significant impact on local tax results we also have various tax assets resulting from acquisitions tax assets can also result from the generation of tax losses in certain legal entities tax authorities may challenge these tax assets in addition the value of the tax assets resulting from tax losses carried forward depends on having sufficient taxable profits in the future 

additionally in december of 2017 the united states enacted a budget reconciliation act amending the internal revenue code of 1986 the “tax cuts and jobs act” and in 2018 the us treasury department issued regulations to clarify certain provisions of the tax cuts and jobs act the tax cuts and jobs act contains provisions affecting the tax treatment of both us companies such as certain of our subsidiaries and nonus companies that could materially affect us the tax cuts and jobs act includes provisions that reduce the us corporate tax rate impose a base erosion minimum tax on income of a us corporation determined without regard to certain otherwise deductible payments made to certain foreign affiliates impose a global intangible lowincome tax on foreign earnings made by us corporations’ foreign subsidiaries and impose a onetime transition tax on certain historic earnings and profits of usowned foreign subsidiaries the tax cuts and jobs act also includes provisions that provide a deduction for certain foreignderived intangible income the us treasury department has issued temporary and proposed regulations providing guidance on the application of many of the provisions of the tax cuts and jobs act however there may continue to be a substantial delay before all such regulations are promulgated andor finalized increasing the uncertainty as to the ultimate effect of the statutory amendments on us it is also possible that there will be technical corrections legislation proposed with respect to the tax cuts and jobs act the effect of which cannot be predicted 

we may not be able to maintain a competitive worldwide effective corporate tax rate 

we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because of among other things uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate our actual effective tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material additionally the tax laws of the netherlands the us and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate 

there may from time to time exist deficiencies in our internal control systems that could adversely affect the accuracy and reliability of our periodic reporting 

we are required to establish and periodically assess the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting despite the compliance procedures that we have adopted to ensure internal control over financial controls there may from time to time exist deficiencies in our internal control systems that could adversely affect the accuracy and reliability of our periodic reporting our periodic reporting is the basis of investors’ and other market professionals’ understanding of our businesses imperfections in our periodic reporting could create uncertainty regarding the reliability of our results of operations and financial results which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our reputation or share price 

environmental laws and regulations expose us to liability and compliance with these laws and regulations and any such liability may adversely affect our business 

we are subject to many environmental health and safety laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate which govern among other things emissions of pollutants into the air wastewater discharges the use and handling of hazardous substances waste disposal the investigation and remediation of soil and ground water contamination and the health and safety of our employees we are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws regulations and permits if we violate or fail to comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 

as with other companies engaged in similar activities or that own or operate real property we face inherent risks of environmental liability at our current and historical manufacturing facilities certain environmental laws impose strict and in certain circumstances joint and several liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous 

substances as well as liability for related damages to natural resources certain of these laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated while we do not expect that any contamination currently known to us will have a material adverse effect on our business we cannot assure you that this is the case or that we will not discover new facts or conditions or that environmental laws or the enforcement of such laws will not change such that our liabilities would be increased significantly in addition we could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage in summary we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to regulated materials will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions and results of operations 

scientific examination of political attention to and rules and regulations on issues surrounding the existence and extent of climate change may result in an increase in the cost of production due to increase in the prices of energy and introduction of energy or carbon tax a variety of regulatory developments have been introduced that focus on restricting or managing the emission of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases enterprises may need to purchase at higher costs new equipment or raw materials with lower carbon footprints environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment modify product designs or incur expenses new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may become subject to regulation these developments and further legislation that is likely to be enacted could affect our operations negatively changes in environmental regulations could increase our production and operational costs which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

certain natural disasters such as flooding large earthquakes volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters may negatively impact our business there is increasing concern that climate change is occurring and may cause a rising number of natural disasters 

environmental and other disasters such as flooding large earthquakes volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters or a combination thereof may negatively impact our business if flooding a large earthquake volcanic eruption or other natural disaster were to directly damage destroy or disrupt our manufacturing facilities it could disrupt our operations delay new production and shipments of existing inventory or result in costly repairs replacements or other costs all of which would negatively impact our business even if our manufacturing facilities are not directly damaged a large natural disaster may result in disruptions in distribution channels or supply chains and significant increases in the prices of raw materials used for our manufacturing process for instance the nuclear incident following the tsunami in japan in 2011 impacted the supply chains of our customers and suppliers furthermore any disaster affecting our customers or their respective customers may significantly negatively impact the demand for our products and our revenues 

the impact of any such natural disasters depends on the specific geographic circumstances but could be significant as some of our factories are located in areas with known earthquake fault zones flood or storm risks including but not limited to singapore taiwan malaysia or thailand there is increasing concern that climate change is occurring that may cause a rising number of natural disasters with potentially dramatic effects on human activity we cannot predict the economic impact if any of natural disasters or climate change 

the price of our common stock historically has been volatile the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly 

the stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies the market price for our common stock has varied between a high of 12950 on december 26 2019 and a low of 7156 on january 2 2019 in the twelvemonth period ending on december 31 2019  the market price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations for many reasons including in response to the risks described in this section changes in our dividend or share repurchase policies or for reasons unrelated to our operations such as reports by industry analysts investor perceptions or negative announcements by our customers competitors peer companies or suppliers regarding their own performance or announcements by our competitors of significant contracts strategic partnerships joint ventures joint marketing relationships or capital commitments the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments affecting us or our industry as well as industry conditions and general financial economic and political instability in the past following periods of 

market volatility shareholders have instituted securities class action litigation if we were involved in securities litigation it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of executive management from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation 

we may have fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases 

the amount timing and execution of our stock repurchases may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes—such as investing in our business including operational spending capital spending and acquisitions and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments—and because of changes in cash flows tax laws and the market price of our common stock 

future sales of our shares of common stock could depress the market price of our outstanding shares of common stock 

the market price of our shares of common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 

in the future we may issue additional shares of common stock in connection with acquisitions and other investments the amount of our common stock issued in connection with any such transaction could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends 

our board of directors has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we currently pay a cash dividend on our ordinary shares on a quarterly basis the declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the approval of our board and our dividend may be discontinued or reduced at any time there can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends in the future in any particular amounts or at all 

future dividends if any and their timing and amount may be affected by among other factors management’s views on potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions including acquisitions earnings levels contractual restrictions cash position and overall financial condition and changes to our business model the payment of cash dividends is restricted by applicable law contractual restrictions and our corporate structure 

our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance 

from time to time we release guidance regarding our future performance that represents our management’s estimates as of the date of release this guidance which consists of forwardlooking statements is prepared by our management and is qualified by and subject to the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in such release and the factors described under “forwardlooking statements” our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the american institute of certified public accountants and neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles reviews or examines the guidance and accordingly no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto 

our guidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that while presented with numerical specificity is inherently subject to significant business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions some of which will change we generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges the principal reason that we release this data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors we do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons 

guidance is necessarily speculative in nature and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results accordingly our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release actual results will vary from the guidance and the variations may be material investors should also recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data diminishes the farther in the future the data is forecasted in light of the foregoing investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it 

any failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in or incorporated by reference into this annual report could result in the actual operating results being different than the guidance and such differences may be adverse and material 

risks related to our corporate structure 

united states civil liabilities may not be enforceable against us 

we are incorporated under the laws of the netherlands and substantial portions of our assets are located outside of the united states in addition certain members of our board our officers and certain experts named herein reside outside the united states as a result it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the united states upon us or such other persons residing outside the united states or to enforce outside the united states judgments obtained against such persons in us courts in any action in addition it may be difficult for investors to enforce in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the united states rights predicated upon the us laws 

in the absence of an applicable treaty for the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments other than arbitration awards in civil and commercial matters to which the united states and the netherlands are a party a judgment obtained against the company in the courts of the united states whether or not predicated solely upon the us federal securities laws including a judgment predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the us securities law or securities laws of any state or territory within the united states will not be directly enforceable in the netherlands 

in order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the netherlands the claim must be relitigated before a competent court of the netherlands the relevant netherlands court has discretion to attach such weight to a judgment of the courts of the united states as it deems appropriate based on case law the courts of the netherlands may be expected to recognize and grant permission for enforcement of a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction in the united states without reexamination or relitigation of the substantive matters adjudicated thereby provided that i the relevant court in the united states had jurisdiction in the matter in accordance with standards which are generally accepted internationally ii the proceedings before that court complied with principles of proper procedure iii recognition andor enforcement of that judgment does not conflict with the public policy of the netherlands and iv recognition andor enforcement of that judgment is not irreconcilable with a decision of a dutch court rendered between the same parties or with an earlier decision of a foreign court rendered between the same parties in a dispute that is about the same subject matter and that is based on the same cause provided that earlier decision can be recognized in the netherlands 

based on the foregoing there can be no assurance that us investors will be able to enforce against us or members of our board of directors officers or certain experts named herein who are residents of the netherlands or countries other than the united states any judgments obtained in us courts in civil and commercial matters 

in addition there is doubt as to whether a dutch court would impose civil liability on us the members of our board of directors our officers or certain experts named herein in an original action predicated solely upon the us laws brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in the netherlands against us or such members officers or experts respectively 

we are a dutch public company with limited liability the rights of our stockholders may be different from the rights of stockholders governed by the laws of us jurisdictions

risks related to our indebtedness 

our debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our financial condition which could adversely affect our results of operations 

as of december 31 2019 we had outstanding indebtedness with an aggregate principal amount of 7400 million our substantial indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business by 

 

despite our level of indebtedness we may still incur significantly more debt which could further exacerbate the risks described above and affect our ability to service and repay our debt 

if we do not comply with the covenants in our debt agreements or fail to generate sufficient cash to service and repay our debt it could adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition 

the rcf agreement and the indentures governing our unsecured notes or any other debt arrangements that we may have require us to comply with various covenants if there were an event of default under any of our debt instruments that was not cured or waived the holders of the defaulted debt could terminate commitments to lend and cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt to be due and payable immediately which in turn could result in cross defaults under our other debt instruments our assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under all of our outstanding debt instruments if some or all of these instruments are accelerated upon an event of default 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or future borrowings under the rcf agreement or other sources may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs including our working capital and capital expenditure requirements and we may be forced 

to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets or operations seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets seek additional capital restructure or refinance our indebtedness or reduce or delay capital expenditures strategic acquisitions investments and alliances any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt and fund our planned capital expenditures and business plan our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives in addition any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations 

the rating of our debt by major rating agencies may further improve or deteriorate which could affect our additional borrowing capacity and financing costs 

the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt these ratings are based on current information furnished to the ratings agencies by us and information obtained by the ratings agencies from other sources an explanation of the significance of such rating may be obtained from such rating agency there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in each rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade could affect our market value andor increase our corporate borrowing costs

overview 



revenue for 2019 was down 56 from 2018 against a very challenging semiconductor industry backdrop revenues decreased by 7 in our largest end market automotive and 12 in our industrial and iot end market which were slightly offset by an increase of 5 in the communications  infrastructure end market and a 2 increase in the mobile end market when aggregating all end markets the decrease in revenue was mostly related to lower sales to distributors due to lower end customer demand in particular in greater china including asia pacific 

notwithstanding the challenging operating environment we continue to successfully execute our strategy within our target markets and focus on driving profitability our gross profit percentage for 2019 increased from 516 to 520 due to a slightly more favorable endmarket and customer mix and also due to the benefit of certain manufacturing cost controls 

nxp’s fourth quarter revenue of 2301 million increased 16 sequentially from the third quarter of 2019  this was driven primarily by an increase of 5 in the automotive endmarket and a 3 increase in the mobile endmarket these increases were offset by a 3 decline in each of the other two end markets we continue to believe that the demand trends within our end markets are beginning to improve 

over the course of 2019  we significantly enhanced our product portfolio at the end of the year we announced the completion of the acquisition of the marvell wireless connectivity assets and with that introduced new product solutions our customers have already begun to adopt many of the new solutions which we anticipate will help to underpin nxps longterm growth 

we continue to generate strong operating cash flows with 2373 million in cash flows from operations for 2019  we returned 1762 million to our shareholders during the year in dividends and repurchases of common stock on august 29 2019 we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend by 0125 or 50 to 0375 per common share our cash position at the end of 2019 was 1045 million on november 19 2019  the nxp board of directors approved a cash dividend of 0375 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2019  

results of operations 

the following table presents the composition of operating income for the years ended december 31 2019 and december 31 2018  



revenue 

revenue for the yearended december 31 2019 was  8877 million compared to  9407 million for the yearended december 31 2018  a decrease of 530 million or 56  as of january 1 2019 income and expenses derived from manufacturing service arrangements “msa” and transitional service arrangements “tsa” that are put into 

place when we divest a business or activity are included in other income expense in 2018 revenue related to these divested activities was 136 million the remaining decrease is essentially related to lower sales in our automotive and in our industrial  iot end markets which were in particular impacted by the trade tensions between the united states and china 

revenue by endmarket was as follows 



revenue by sales channel was as follows 



revenue by geographic region which is based on the customer’s shippedto location except for intellectual property license revenue which is attributable to the netherlands was as follows 





the decrease in revenue in the automotive end market of 295 million is the result of a decline in volumes in all of the related product groups the weakness was primarily driven by greater china including asia pacific through lower demand from both our distributors and oem customers as a result of lower vehicle production and lower vehicle sales but weakness was also seen in emea and the americas 

the decrease in revenue in the industrial  iot end market of 214 million was essentially associated with our microcontrollers product group with a decrease in distributor sales primarily in greater china including asia pacific 

the net increase in revenue of 27 million in the mobile end market was mostly driven by the strong adoption of our secure mobile wallet solutions with key oems offset by declines in our semicustom mobile analog interface products through our distribution channel and both within the greater china including asia pacific region 

the increase of 88 million in the communication infrastructure  other end market was related to robust growth in rf products in greater china including asia pacific due to the adoption of the company’s massivemimo “mmimo” solutions for the cellular basestation market as mobile carriers began to increase network densification efforts ahead of future 5g cellular deployments but partly offset by a reduction in the company’s secure bank card and egovernment product groups in greater china including asia pacific as well as in europe 

gross profit 

gross profit for the yearended december 31 2019 was  4618 million or 520  of revenue compared to  4851 million or 516  of revenue for the yearended december 31 2018  the decrease of  233 million was primarily driven by lower revenue resulting from lower demand the gross margin percentage increased from 516 to 520 due to a slightly more favorable endmarket and customer mix and also due to the benefit of certain manufacturing cost controls 

operating expenses 

operating expenses for the yearended december 31 2019 totaled  4002 million or 451  of revenue compared to  4142 million or 44  of revenue for the yearended december 31 2018  

the following table below presents the composition of operating expenses by line item in the statement of operations 





the decrease in operating expenses was a result of the following items 

research and development rd costs primarily consist of engineer salaries and wages including share based compensation and other variable compensation engineering related costs including outside services fixedasset ip and other licenses related costs shared service center costs and other preproduction related expenses 

• rd costs for the yearended december 31 2019 decreased by 57 million or 34 when compared to last year driven by 

 lower variable compensation costs 

 lower costs associated with the qualcomm transaction 

 higher restructuring costs and 

 sharebased compensation expenses 

selling general and administrative sga costs primarily consist of personnel salaries and wages including share based compensation and other variable compensation communication and it related costs fixedasset related costs and sales and marketing costs including travel expenses 

• sga costs for the yearended december 31 2019 decreased by 69 million or 69 when compared to last year mainly due to 

 lower salaries 

 lower variable compensation costs 

 lower costs associated with the qualcomm transaction 

 reductions in information technology expenditures as well as in professional services and 

 higher sharebased compensation expenses driven by the equity reboot grant to executives in 2018 

• amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets slightly decreased by 14 million or 10 when compared to last year driven by 

 certain intangibles became fully amortized during 2019 and 

 the start of amortization of intangible assets related to the wifi marvell acquisition 

other income expense 

as of january 1 2019 income and expenses derived from manufacturing service arrangements “msa” and transitional service arrangements “tsa” that are put into place when we divest a business or activity are included in other income expense these arrangements are shortterm in nature and are expected to decrease as the divested business or activity becomes more established 

the following table presents the split of other income expense for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  



other income expense reflects income of  25 million for 2019  compared to  2001 million of income in 2018  included in 2019 is 20 million relating to the sale of assets whereas the 2018 amount included the 2 billion termination compensation received from qualcomm 

financial income expense 



financial income expense was an expense of  350 million in 2019  compared to an expense of  335 million in 2018  the change in financial income expense is primarily attributable to an increase in interest expenses net of 88 million as a result of higher debt levels throughout 2019 partially offset by lower debt extinguishment costs in 2019 versus 2018 of 15 million and the absence of the one time charge 60 million on certain financial instruments for compensation related to an adjustment event required by the termination of the qualcomm transaction in 2018 

benefit provision for income taxes 

we recorded an income tax expense of  20 million for the yearended december 31 2019  which reflects an effective tax rate of 69 compared to an expense of 176 million 74 for the yearended december 31 2018  

the effective tax rate reflects the impact of tax incentives a portion of our earnings being taxed in foreign jurisdictions at rates different than the netherlands statutory tax rate adjustments of prior years income taxes change in valuation allowance and nondeductible expenses the impact of these items results in offsetting factors that attribute to the change in the effective tax rate between the two periods with the significant drivers outlined below 

   

on a goforward basis cash payments for corporate income taxes that are relative to our ongoing operations are expected at 45 – 50 million per quarter during 2020  our future cash payments for income taxes will also be impacted by nonrecurring events resulting in additional payments of 125 million in total which will be paid in 2020 

results relating to equityaccounted investees 

results relating to equityaccounted investees amounted to a gain of 1 million in 2019  whereas in 2018  results relating to equityaccounted investees amounted to a gain of 59 million which includes a net gain realized of 51 million resulting from the sale of asen in july 2018 

noncontrolling interests 

noncontrolling interests are related to the thirdparty share in the results of consolidated companies predominantly ssmc their share of noncontrolling interests amounted to a profit of 29 million for the yearended december 31 2019  compared to a profit of  50 million for the yearended december 31 2018  

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

we derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from our cash flows from operations we continue to generate strong positive operating cash flows as of december 31 2019  our cash balance was  1045 million a decrease of  1744 million compared to december 31 2018  2789 million taking into account the available undrawn amount of the unsecured revolving credit facility the “rcf agreement” of  1500 million we had access to  2545 million of liquidity as of december 31 2019  

we currently use cash to fund operations meet working capital requirements for capital expenditures and for potential common stock repurchases dividends and strategic investments based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our current available sources of funds including cash and cash equivalents rcf agreement plus anticipated cash generated from operations will be adequate to finance our operations working capital requirements capital expenditures and potential dividends for at least the next year our capital expenditures were  526 million in 2019  compared to  611 million in 2018  

the common stock repurchase activity was as follows

from time to time we engage in discussions with third parties regarding potential acquisitions of or investments in businesses technologies and product lines any such transaction could require significant use of our cash and cash equivalents or require us to arrange for new debt and equity financing to fund the transaction our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions in the future we may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or we may not have enough capacity under the rcf agreement or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness including the rcf agreement the unsecured notes or 

to fund our other liquidity needs including working capital and capital expenditure requirements in any such case we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets or operations seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness see part i item 1a risk factors

the change in operating assets and liabilities working capital accounts was attributable to the following

in addition to the above obligations we enter into a variety of agreements in the normal course of business containing provisions that certain penalties may be charged if we do not fulfill our commitments it is not possible to predict with certainty the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar provisions due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular case historically payments pursuant to such provisions have not been material and we believe that any future payments required pursuant to such provisions would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition however such payments may be material to our consolidated statement of operations for a specific period 

we sponsor pension plans in many countries in accordance with legal requirements customs and the local situation in the countries involved these are definedbenefit pension plans defined contribution pension plans and multiemployer plans contributions to funded pension plans are made as necessary to provide sufficient 

assets to meet future benefits payable to plan participants these contributions are determined by various factors including funded status legal and tax considerations and local customs the expected cash outflows in 2020 and subsequent years are uncertain and may change as a consequence of statutory funding requirements as well as changes in actual versus currently assumed discount rates estimations of compensation increases and returns on pension plan assets 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with us gaap requires our management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes our management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience current economic and industry conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain our most critical accounting estimates include 

 

in the following section we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved 

inventories 

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market we regularly review our inventories and write down our inventories for estimated losses due to obsolescence this allowance is determined for groups of products based on sales of our products in the recent past andor expected future demand future demand is affected by market conditions technological obsolescence new products and strategic plans each of which is subject to change with little or no forewarning in estimating obsolescence we utilize information that includes projecting future demand 

the need for strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive delivery performance to our customers are balanced against the risk of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 

the change in our reserves for inventories was primarily due to the normal review and accrual of obsolete or excess inventory if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by our management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

goodwill 

goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired such events or changes in circumstances can be significant changes in business climate operating performance or competition or upon the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred between annual test dates this impairment review compares the fair value for each reporting unit containing goodwill to its carrying value determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital and future economic and market conditions we base our fairvalue estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable actual cash flow amounts for future periods may differ from estimates used in impairment testing 

for the annual impairment assessment for the yearended december 31 2019  we determined that for our reporting unitthe fair value exceeded the carrying value during the third and fourth quarter of each of the prior two fiscal years respectively we have completed our annual impairment assessments and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these years 

impairment or disposal of identified intangible assets and tangible fixed assets 

we perform reviews of property plant and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles excluding goodwill to determine if facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than what we had originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable if such facts and circumstances exist we assess the recoverability of the longlived assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts in the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the assets or based on appraisals impairment losses if any are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 

the assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other longlived assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by various factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines in 2019 and 2018 we had no impairments in 2017 we recognized impairment charges of 23 million of which 16 million relative to iprd that was acquired from freescale 

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenue under the core principle to depict the transfer of control to customers in an amount reflecting the consideration the company expects to be entitled in order to achieve that core principle the company applies the following five step approach 1 identify the contract with a customer 2 identify the performance obligations in the contract 3 determine the transaction price 4 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied 

the vast majority of the company’s revenue is derived from the sale of semiconductor products to distributors original equipment manufacturers “oems” and similar customers in determining the transaction price the company evaluates whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled variable consideration is estimated and includes the impact of discounts price protection product returns and distributor incentive programs the estimate of variable consideration is dependent on a variety of factors including contractual terms analysis of historical data current economic conditions industry demand and both the current and forecasted pricing environments the estimate of variable consideration is not constrained because the company has extensive experience with these contracts 

revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer ie when the company’s performance obligation is satisfied which typically occurs at shipment in determining whether 

control has transferred the company considers if there is a present right to payment and legal title and whether risks and rewards of ownership having transferred to the customer 

for sales to distributors revenue is recognized upon transfer of control to the distributor for some distributors contractual arrangements are in place which allow these distributors to return products if certain conditions are met these conditions generally relate to the time period during which a return is allowed and reflect customary conditions in the particular geographic market other return conditions relate to circumstances arising at the end of a product life cycle when certain distributors are permitted to return products purchased during a predefined period after the company has announced a product’s pending discontinuance these return rights are a form of variable consideration and are estimated using the most likely method based on historical return rates in order to reduce revenues recognized however long notice periods associated with these announcements prevent significant amounts of product from being returned for sales where return rights exist the company has determined based on historical data that only a very small percentage of the sales of this type to distributors is actually returned repurchase agreements with oems or distributors are not entered into by the company 

sales to most distributors are made under programs common in the semiconductor industry whereby distributors receive certain price adjustments to meet individual competitive opportunities these programs may include credits granted to distributors or allow distributors to return or scrap a limited amount of product in accordance with contractual terms agreed upon with the distributor or receive price protection credits when our standard published prices are lowered from the price the distributor paid for product still in its inventory in determining the transaction price the company considers the price adjustments from these programs to be variable consideration that reduce the amount of revenue recognized the company’s policy is to estimate such price adjustments using the most likely method based on rolling historical experience rates as well as a prospective view of products and pricing in the distribution channel for distributors who participate in our volume rebate incentive program we continually monitor the actual claimed allowances against our estimates and we adjust our estimates as appropriate to reflect trends in pricing environments and inventory levels the estimates are also adjusted when recent historical data does not represent anticipated future activity historically actual price adjustments for these programs relative to those estimated have not materially differed 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based upon the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled deferred tax liabilities for withholding taxes on dividends from subsidiaries are recognized in situations where the company does not consider the earnings indefinitely reinvested and to the extent that these withholding taxes are not expected to be refundable 

deferred tax assets including assets arising from loss carryforwards are recognized net of a valuation allowance if based upon the available evidence it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized 

the income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities the income tax benefit recognized is measured based on the largest benefit that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon resolution of the uncertainty unrecognized tax benefits are presented as a reduction to the deferred tax asset for related net operating loss carryforwards unless these would not be available in which case the uncertain tax benefits are presented together with the related interest and penalties as a liability under accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities based on the timing of the expected payment penalties are recorded as income tax expense whereas interest is reported as financial expense in the statement of operations 

postretirement benefits 

the company’s employees participate in pension and other postretirement benefit plans in many countries the costs of pension and other postretirement benefits and related assets and liabilities with respect to the company’s employees participating in definedbenefit plans are based upon actuarial valuations 

the projected definedbenefit obligation is calculated annually by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method for the company’s major plans the discount rate is derived from market yields on high quality corporate bonds plans in countries without a deep corporate bond market use a discount rate based on the local government bond rates 

in calculating obligation and expense the company is required to select actuarial assumptions these assumptions include discount rate expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation costs determined based on current market conditions historical information and consultation with and input from our actuaries changes in the key assumptions can have a significant impact to the projected benefit obligations funding requirements and periodic pension cost incurred 

the company determines the fair value of plan assets based on quoted prices or comparable prices for nonquoted assets for a definedbenefit pension plan the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation for any other postretirement defined benefit plan it is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 

sharebased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for all sharebased awards based on the grantdate estimated fair values net of an estimated forfeiture rate we use the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the estimated fair value for certain awards sharebased compensation cost for restricted share units “rsus” with timebased vesting is measured based on the closing fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant reduced by the present value of the estimated expected future dividends and then multiplied by the number of rsus granted sharebased compensation cost for performancebased share units “psus” granted with performance or market conditions is measured using a monte carlo simulation model on the date of grant 

our valuation models and generally accepted valuation techniques require us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards these assumptions and judgments include estimating the volatility of our stock price expected dividend yield employee turnover rates and employee stock option exercise behaviors when establishing the expected life assumption we used the ‘simplified’ method prescribed in asc topic 718 for companies that do not have adequate historical data the riskfree interest rate is measured as the prevailing yield for a us treasury security with a maturity similar to the expected life assumption we also estimate a forfeiture rate at the time of grant and revise this rate in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures or vesting differ from the original estimates 

we evaluate the assumptions used to value our awards on a quarterly basis if factors change and we employ different assumptions sharebased compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past if there are any modifications or cancellation of the underlying unvested securities we may be required to accelerate increase or cancel any remaining unearned sharebased compensation expense 

litigation and claims 

we are regularly involved as plaintiffs or defendants in claims and litigation related to our past and current business operations the claims can cover a broad range of topics including intellectual property reflecting the company’s identity as a global manufacturing and technology business the company vigorously defends itself against improper claims including those asserted in litigation due to the unpredictable nature of litigation there can be no assurance that the company’s accruals will be sufficient to cover the extent of its potential exposure to losses but historically legal actions have not had a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations or financial condition 

the estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is based on currently available information in relation to the claims that have arisen and on the company’s best estimate of such losses for those cases for which such estimate can be made for certain claims the company believes that an estimate cannot currently be made the estimated aggregate range requires significant judgment given the varying stages of the proceedings including the fact that many of them are currently in preliminary stages the existence of multiple defendants including the company in such claims whose share of liability has yet to be determined the numerous yetunresolved issues in many of the claims and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such claims accordingly the company’s estimate will change from time to time and actual losses may be more than the current estimate 

use of certain nongaap financial measures 

net debt is a nongaap financial measure and represents total debt shortterm and longterm after deduction of cash and cash equivalents management believes this measure is appropriate to calculate our net leverage 

we understand that although net debt is used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluation of companies this concept has limitations as an analytical tool and it should not be used as an alternative to any other measure in accordance with us gaap 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates because we finance certain operations through fixed and variable rate debt instruments and denominate our transactions in a variety of foreign currencies changes in these rates may have an impact on future cash flow and earnings we manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

by using derivative instruments we are subject to credit and market risk the fair market value of the derivative instruments is determined by using valuation models whose inputs are derived using market observable inputs including interest rate yield curves as well as foreign exchange and commodity spot and forward rates and reflects the asset or liability position as of the end of each reporting period when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive the counterparty owes us thus creating a receivable risk for us we are exposed to counterparty credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our derivative agreements we minimize counterparty credit or repayment risk by entering into transactions with major financial institutions of investment grade credit rating our exposure to market risk is not hedged in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings or cash flow 

interest rate risk 

our rcf agreement has a 1500 million borrowing capacity with a floating rate interest as there are currently no borrowings under this facility a hypothetical increase in libor based interest rates would not have caused any change to our interest expense on our floating rate debt 

additional information regarding our notes is provided in note 2  significant accounting policies and note 14  debt of our notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report is incorporated herein by reference 

foreign currency risks 

we are also exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could affect operating results as well as our financial position and cash flows we monitor our exposures to these market risks and generally employ operating and financing activities to offset these exposures where appropriate if we do not have operating or financing activities to sufficiently offset these exposures from time to time we may employ derivative financial instruments such as swaps collars forwards options or other instruments to limit the volatility to earnings and cash flows generated by these exposures derivative financial instruments are only used for hedging purposes and not for trading or speculative purposes counterparties to our derivatives 

contracts are all major banking institutions in the event of financial insolvency or distress of a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments we may be unable to settle transactions if the counterparty does not provide us with sufficient collateral to secure its net settlement obligation to us which could have a negative impact on our results the company measures all derivative financial instruments based on fair values derived from market prices of the instruments or from option pricing models as appropriate and record these as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet changes in the fair values are recognized in the statement of operations immediately unless cash flow hedge accounting is applied a summary of our foreign currency accounting policies is provided in note 2  significant accounting policies of our notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report is incorporated herein by reference 

at december 31 2019 our net asset related to foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges of foreign currency risk on certain operating expenditure transactions was 9 million if our forecasted operating expenditures for currencies in which we hedge were to decline by 20 and foreign exchange rates were to change unfavorably by 20 in our hedged foreign currency we would incur a negligible loss 

financial assets and liabilities held by consolidated subsidiaries that are not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may affect reported earnings as a global company we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates we may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions as a result we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments 

our primary foreign currency exposure relates to the us dollar to euro exchange rate however our foreign currency exposures also relate but are not limited to the chinese yuan the japanese yen the pound sterling the malaysian ringgit the singapore dollar the taiwan dollar and the thailand baht
