 item 1a risk factors 

risks and uncertainties 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k and in any other documents to which we refer you in this annual report on form 10k before purchasing our securities the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 

risks related to our business 

our financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be impacted by the covid19 pandemic 

our overall performance depends upon domestic and worldwide economic and political conditions the global spread of covid19 continues to create volatility uncertainty and economic disruption the pandemic caused a slowdown in worldwide economic activity and is currently causing disruptions to global supply chains 

the covid19 pandemic continues to have widespread rapidly evolving and unpredictable impacts on global society economies financial markets and business practices despite the efforts to contain the pandemic new variants of the virus are causing additional outbreaks the covid19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our business operations including our employees customers partners and communities and there is substantial uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time 

the extent to which covid19 impacts our business operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict including 

• the continuing economic impacts of the pandemic 

• governmental business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic 

• the effect on our customers and customer demand for and ability to pay for our products and services 

• restrictions or disruptions to transportation including reduced availability of ground or air transport 

• continued disruption of the supply chain for our products 

• our ability to comply with financial covenants including maintaining required leverage ratios which could result in debt becoming due and payable prior to its stated maturity and 

• changes in our effective tax rate due to effects of covid19 on our geographic mix of earnings 

we have experienced disruption in our supply chain as a result of the effects of covid19 and related events and are subject to ongoing supply chain risks which adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 

we are dependent upon a limited number of contract manufacturers for the manufacture testing and assembly of certain products and specific suppliers for a number of our critical components our current reliance on a limited group of contract manufacturers and suppliers involves risks including the potential inability to obtain products or components to meet customers’ delivery requirements reduced control over pricing and delivery schedules and discontinuation of or increased prices for certain components we have experienced disruption in our supply chain as a result of the effects of covid19 related events and their impact on our suppliers and on international trade in general leading to shortfalls in available components we need to make products as well as increased costs to obtain components to make products and to transport components and products some suppliers have prioritized the orders of larger customers and are focusing their investments in additional capacity on higher volume components we are experiencing extended delivery times for certain components of our hardware products and increased freight costs as a result we are making binding commitments with longer lead times and procuring components at higher prices which may impact our flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions and product demand these disruptions have had an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and have resulted in delays in shipping products to customers and dealers t he severity of the disruptions is continuously changing so that the impact on our ability to meet demand for particular products varies over time which creates substantial uncertainties in forecasting our financial results we expect these disruptions to impact our financial results 

future disruptions could occur as a result of any number of events including but not limited to the continuing impacts of the covid19 pandemic increases in wages that drive up prices or labor the imposition of new regulations quotas or embargoes on components a scarcity of or significant increase in the price of required components for our products trade restrictions tariffs or duties fluctuations in currency exchange rates transportation failures affecting the supply chain and shipment of materials and finished goods third party interference in the integrity of the products sourced through the supply chain the unavailability of raw materials severe weather conditions natural disasters civil unrest military conflicts geopolitical developments war or terrorism and disruptions in utility and other services any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture assemble and test such components internally could significantly delay our ability to ship our products which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our reputation and brand as well as our results of operations 

lastly due to supply chain issues we may accumulate excess inventories if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products 

we operate globally and are subject to significant risks in many jurisdictions 

we have operations in many countries and a significant portion of our revenue is derived from countries outside of the united states as a result our operations and our financial results including our ability to design develop or sell products may be adversely affected by a number of factors outside of our control including 

• global and local economic conditions 

• the demand and cost of commodities such as corn and oil 

• the strength of the agricultural engineering and construction markets 

• inadequate infrastructure and other disruptions such as supply chain interruptions and largescale outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities transportation data hosting or telecommunications providers 

• government restrictions on our operations in any country or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from a particular country 

• differing employment practices and labor issues 

• formal or informal imposition of new or revised export andor import and doingbusiness regulations including trade sanctions tariffs and import or export licensing requirements which could be changed without notice 

• ineffective legal protection of our ip rights in certain countries 

• uncertain economic and political conditions in countries where we do business 

• local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices 

• differing regional responses and restrictions related to global pandemics like the covid19 pandemic and 

• uncertainty regarding social political immigration and trade policies in the us and abroad 

there is an inherent risk that political diplomatic or military events could result in trade disruptions including tariffs trade embargoes export restrictions and other trade barriers a significant trade disruption or the establishment or increase of any trade barrier in any area where we do business could increase the cost of our products which could adversely impact the margin that we earn on sales make our products more expensive for customers or create uncertainty around demand for certain types of products which could make our products less competitive and reduce customer demand given the geopolitical climate there is uncertainty about the trade policies treaties government regulations and tariffs that could apply to trade if ther e were to be a deterioration in the global economy the economies of the countries or regions where our customers are located or do business or the industries that we or our customers serve the demand for our products and services would likely decrease in addition government or customer efforts attitudes laws or policies may lead to nonus customers favoring domestic suppliers that could compete with or replace our products which would also have an adverse effect on our business changes in economic conditions and political uncertainty surrounding international trade also make it difficult to make financial forecasts 

risks associated with engaging in international business include 

• longer payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems 

• difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations 

• differing local customer product preferences and requirements than our us markets 

• difficulties protecting or procuring intellectual property rights and 

• compliance with changes in local laws including those relating to privacy labor and local content 

these factors or any combination of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to effectively integrate streamline and manage our increasingly diverse and complex businesses and operations our ability to generate growth and revenue from new or existing customers may be adversely affected 

because our operations are geographically diverse and increasingly complex our personnel resources and infrastructure could become strained and our reputation in the market and our ability to successfully manage and grow our business may be adversely affected the size complexity and diverse nature of our business and the expansion of our product lines and customer base have placed increased demands on our management and operations and future growth may place additional strains on our resources in the future our ability to effectively compete and to manage our planned future growth will depend on among other things the following 

• maintaining continuity in our senior management and key personnel 

• increasing the productivity of our existing employees 

• attracting retaining training and motivating our employees particularly our technical and management personnel 

• deploying our solutions using third party information systems which may require changes to our applications documentation and operational processes 

• improving our operational financial and management controls and 

• improving our information reporting systems and procedures 

we have increasingly diversified the nature of our businesses both organically and by acquisition as a result an increasing amount of our business involves business models that require managerial techniques and skill sets that are different from those required to manage our historical core businesses 

pursuant to our connect and scale strategy we are investing substantial resources in integrating our product offerings and transitioning our businesses to common core services and systems in order to achieve economies of scale simplify our operations and improve the customer experience these efforts may result in disruptions to our operations which could have an adverse effect on our customers may cost more than we anticipate increasing our expenses and take longer than planned 

these factors or a combination of these factors could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in our software and subscription businesses may adversely impact our operations and financial results 

an increasing portion of our revenue is generated through software maintenance and subscription revenue which includes software as a service “saas” and new subscription services for integrated solutions our customers have no obligation to renew their agreements for our software maintenance or subscription services after the expiration of their initial contract period which typically ranges from one to three years this shift reflects both an increasing use of subscription models for new products and a transition for some existing products from perpetual license sales and distribution in favor of saas or other subscription offerings 

our customer acquisition and renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including overall economic conditions the health of their businesses competitive offerings and customer dissatisfaction with our services customer satisfaction with our services is affected by a variety of factors including but not limited to security reliability performance concerns about data privacy current subscription terms customer preference and industry adoption if customers do not renew their contracts for our products our maintenance and subscription revenue will decline and our financial results will suffer 

our subscription models provide our customers the right to access certain of our software in a hosted environment or use downloaded software for a specified subscription period market acceptance of such offerings is affected by a variety of factors including but not limited to security reliability performance current license terms customer preference and industry adoption socialcommunity engagement customer concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage their data public concerns regarding privacy and the enactment of restrictive laws or regulations if we are unable to successfully market and support our subscription offerings our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

we continually reevaluate our software licensing programs and subscription programs including specific license models delivery methods and terms and conditions changes to our licensing programs and subscription programs including the introduction of new subscription services for integrated solutions that include hardware the timing of the release of enhancements upgrades maintenance releases the term of the contract discounts and promotions could impact the timing of the recognition of revenue for our products and adversely affect our cash flow operating results and financial condition 

we may not be able to enter into or maintain important alliances and distribution relationships 

we believe that in certain business opportunities our success will depend on our ability to form and maintain alliances with industry participants such as caterpillar nikon hilti and cnh industrial our failure to form and maintain such alliances or the preemption or disruption of such alliances by actions of competitors could adversely affect our ability to sell our products to customers our relationships with substantial industry participants such as caterpillar and cnh industrial are complex and multifaceted and are likely to evolve over time based upon the changing business needs and objectives of the parties evolution of our respective business strategies and diversification of product portfolios may lead to increased competition with our strategic allies placing additional pressure on these relationships since these strategic relationships contribute to significant ongoing business in certain of our important markets changes in these relationships could adversely affect our sales in addition we utilize dealer networks including those affiliated with some of our strategic allies such as caterpillar and cnh industrial to market sell and service many of our products 

to develop and expand our distribution channels we must continue to expand and improve our processes and procedures that support our distribution channels including our investment in systems and training and those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and difficult to manage the time and expense required for sales and marketing organizations of our channel partners to become familiar with our product offerings including our new product developments and newer types of offering such as subscription programs for integrated solutions that include hardware software maintenance and other recurring services may make it more difficult to introduce those products to end users and delay enduser adoption which could result in lower revenue 

disruption of dealer coverage within specific geographic or enduser markets could cause difficulties in marketing selling or servicing our products and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations lastly dealers who carry products that compete with our products may focus their inventory purchases and sales efforts on goods provided by competitors due to industry demand or profitability such sourcing decisions can adversely impact our sales financial condition an d results of operations 

investing in and integrating new acquisitions or divesting businesses could be costly place a significant strain on our management systems and resources or fail to deliver expected outcomes which could adversely impact our results of operations 

we typically acquire a number of businesses each year and intend to continue to acquire other businesses acquisitions entail numerous risks including 

• potential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or to realize cost savings or other anticipated benefits from integration 

• loss of key employees or customers of acquired operations 

• difficulty of assimilating geographically dispersed operations and personnel of the acquired companies 

• potential disruption of our business or the acquired business 

• unanticipated expenses related to acquisitions 

• unanticipated difficulties in conforming business practices policies procedures internal controls and financial records of acquisitions with our own business 

• impairment of relationships with employees customers vendors distributors or business partners of either an acquired company or our own business 

• inability to accurately forecast the performance of recently acquired businesses resulting in unforeseen adverse effects on our operating results 

• potential liabilities including liabilities resulting from known or unknown compliance or legal issues associated with an acquired business and 

• adverse accounting impact to our results of operations because of purchase accounting treatment and the business or accounting practices of acquired companies 

any such effects from acquisitions could be costly and place a significant strain on our management systems and resources 

as a result of acquisitions we have significant assets that include goodwill and other purchased intangibles the testing of goodwill and intangibles for impairment under generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires us to make significant judgments and assumptions changes in business conditions or in the prospects or results of operations of the acquired business could require adjustments to the valuation of these assets resulting in impairments that would adversely affect our results in addition changes in the operating results or the valuation of companies in which we have investments may have a direct impact on our financial statements or could result in our having to write down the value of such investment 

even if successfully negotiated and closed acquisitions may not yield expected synergies may not advance our business strategy as expected may fall short of expected returnoninvestment targets or may not prove successful or effective for our business companies that we acquire may operate with different cost and margin structures which could further cause fluctuations in our operating results and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we have divested businesses and we expect to do so in the future any such divestiture may result in 

• a disruption of our business 

• reduced synergies including the loss of scale or key employees 

• impairment of customer relationships and 

• reductions in the breadth of our product offerings 

divestitures may adversely impact our results if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested products or businesses or mitigate overhead costs allocated to those businesses we could also experience higher than expected transaction costs and writeoffs of significant amounts of goodwill 

we face substantial competition in our markets which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our financial condition and results of operations 

our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price quality and performance of our products the effectiveness of our distribution channel and direct sales force the level of customer service the development of new technology and our ability to participate in emerging markets within each of our markets we encounter direct competition from other gnss software optical and laser suppliers and competition may intensify from various larger us and nonus competitors and new market entrants particularly from markets such as china our products which commonly use gnss for basic location information may be subject to competition from alternative location technologies such as simultaneous location and mapping technology in our software and subscription services businesses we face competition from a group of large wellestablished companies particularly in the areas of design enterprise resource planning “erp” and collaboration and project management solutions our integrated hardware and software products may be subject to increasing competition from mass market devices such as smartphones and tablets used in conjunction with relatively inexpensive applications which have not been heavily used for commercial applications in the past 

these competitive developments may require us to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes that we have not previously been exposed to including those related to cloud computing mobile devices and new computing platforms such competition has in the past resulted and in the future may result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the future against existing and additional competitors will depend largely on our ability to execute our strategy to provide products with significantly differentiated features compared to currently available products we may not be able to implement this strategy successfully and our products may not be competitive with other technologies or products that may be developed by our competitors many of whom have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing sales and other resources than we do 

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could be harmed 

our continued success depends in part on our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel and to advance our corporate strategy and preserve the key aspects of our corporate culture because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products we are particularly dependent on our ability to hire and retain qualified engineers including in areas of technology such as gnss software programming information systems and data analytics in addition to increase revenues we will be required to increase the size and productivity of our sales and channel management groups competition for qualified employees in our major locations is intense the covid19 pandemic has also heavily impacted the environment for attracting and managing employees and our failure to successfully manage these changes and navigate transitions such as return to office could harm our ability to attract and retain the best talent our inability to hire and retain qualified management and skilled personnel particularly engineers salespeople and key executive management could disrupt our development efforts sales results business relationships and our ability to execute our business plan and strategy on a timely basis and could materially and adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

equity grants are a critical component of our current compensation programs if we fail to grant equity competitively we may have difficulty attracting and retaining critical employees in addition because of our sales structure cash and equity incentive compensation plans we may be at increased risk of losing employees at certain times for example the retention value of our compensation plans decreases after the payment of periodic bonuses or the vesting of equity awards 

risks related to our technology and products 

our products are highly technical and may contain undetected errors product defects security vulnerabilities or software errors 

our products including our software products are highly technical and complex and when deployed may contain errors defects or security vulnerabilities we must develop our products quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing market and we have a history of frequently introducing new products products and services as sophisticated as ours could contain undetected errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new models or versions are released such occurrences could result in damage to our reputation lost revenue diverted development resources increased customer service and support costs warranty claims and litigation 

we warrant that our products will be free of defect for various periods of time depending on the product in addition certain of our contracts include epidemic failure clauses if invoked these clauses may entitle the customer to return or obtain credits for products and inventory or to cancel outstanding purchase orders even if the products themselves are not defective 

errors viruses or bugs may be present in software or hardware that we acquire or license from third parties and incorporate into our products or in thirdparty software or hardware that our customers use in conjunction with our products our customers’ proprietary software and network firewall protections may corrupt data from our products and create difficulties in implementing our solutions changes to thirdparty software or hardware that our customers use in conjunction with our software could also render our applications inoperable any errors defects or security vulnerabilities in our products or any defects in or compatibility issues with any thirdparty hardware or software or customers’ network environments discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in revenue recognition loss of customers theft of trade secrets data or intellectual property and increased service and warranty cost any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products alone or in combination with thirdparty hardware or software could expose them to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses and other malicious software programs that could attack our products actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could harm our reputation and lead some customers to return products to reduce or delay future purchases or use competitive products 

our internal and customerfacing systems and systems of third parties we rely upon may be subject to cybersecurity breaches disruptions or delays 

a cybersecurity incident in our own systems or the systems of our thirdparty providers may compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of our own internal data the availability of our products and websites designed to support our customers or our customer data computer hackers foreign governments cybercriminals or cyber terrorists may attempt to or succeed in penetrating our network security and our website the discovery of widescale cybersecurity intrusions into us government and private company computer networks by alleged russian state actors and the mobilization of largescale cybercrime actors using ransomware and other techniques underscore the ongoing threat posed by sophisticated private and foreign statesponsored attacks unauthorized access to our proprietary business information or customer data may be obtained through breakins sabotage breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks employee theft or misuse breach of the security of the networks of our thirdparty providers or other misconduct additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data 

we have experienced security breaches in the past and despite our efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our systems it is impossible to eliminate this risk because the techniques used by computer hackers who may attempt to penetrate and sabotage our network security or our website change frequently they may take advantage of weaknesses in third party technology or standards of which we are unaware or that we do not control and may not be recognized until long after they have been launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate or counter these techniques it is also possible that unauthorized access to customer data or confidential information may be obtained through inadequate use of security controls by customers vendors or business partners efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop implement and maintain such efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated and may limit the functionality of or otherwise adversely impact our service offering and systems a cybersecurity incident affecting our systems may also result in theft of our intellectual property proprietary data or trade secrets which would compromise our competitive position reputation and operating results we also may be required to notify regulators about any actual or perceived personal data breach including the eu lead data protection authority as well as the individuals who are affected by the incident within strict time periods 

the systems we rely upon also remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from a number of other factors including access to the internet the failure of our network or software systems or significant variability in visitor traffic on our product websites earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunication failures computer viruses human error and similar events or disruptions some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities our systems are also subject to intentional acts of vandalism despite any precautions we may take the occurrence of a natural disaster a decision by any of our thirdparty hosting providers to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could cause system interruptions and delays and result in loss of critical data and lengthy interruptions in our services 

we rely on our information systems and those of third parties for activities such as processing customer orders delivery of products hosting and providing services and support to our customers billing and tracking our customers hosting and managing our customer data and otherwise running our business any disruptions or unexpected incompatibilities in our information systems and those of the third parties upon whom we rely could have a significant impact on our business 

an increasing portion of our revenue comes from saas solutions and other hosted services in which we store retrieve communicate and manage data that is critical to our customers’ business systems disruption of our systems that support these services and solutions could cause disruptions in our customers’ systems and in the businesses that rely on these systems any such disruptions could harm our reputation create liabilities to our customers hurt demand for our services and solutions and adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on new products and services and if we are unable to successfully introduce them into the market or to effectively compete with new disruptive product alternatives our customer base may decline or fail to grow as anticipated 

our future revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to bring new products and services to market on a timely basis we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products and services enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance of such products and services we may encounter problems in the future in innovating and introducing new products and services our development stage products may not be successfully completed or if developed may not achieve significant customer acceptance development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and we might not achieve our goals as to the timing of introducing new technology products or could encounter increased costs the timely availability and costeffective production of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success this has been and may continue to be negatively impacted by the global supply chain shortage if we are unable to introduce new products and services if other companies develop competing technology products and services or if we do not develop compelling new products and services our number of customers may not grow as anticipated or may decline which could harm our operating results many of our offerings are increasingly focused on software and subscription services the software industry is characterized by rapidly changing customer preferences which require us to address multiple delivery platforms new mobile devices and cloud computing life cycles of software products can be short and this can exacerbate the risks associated with developing new products the introduction of third party solutions embodying new disruptive technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could make our existing and future software solutions and other products obsolete or noncompetitive if we are not able to develop software and other solutions that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers or if we are unable to adapt to new platforms technologies or new industry standards that impact our markets our ability to retain or increase market share and results of operations could be adversely affected 

some of our products rely on thirdparty technologies including opensource software which could result in product incompatibilities or harm availability of our products and services 

we license software technologies and intellectual property underlying some of our software from third parties the thirdparty licenses we rely upon may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all and the software and technologies may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors resulting in development delays some software licenses are subject to annual renewals at the discretion of the licensors in some cases if we were to breach a provision of these license agreements the licensor could terminate the agreement immediately the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such thirdparty software or technology could result in increased costs or delays in software releases or updates until such issues have been resolved this could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also incorporate opensource software into our products although we monitor our use of opensource software the terms of many opensource licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market or sell our products or to develop new products in such event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products to disclose and offer royaltyfree licenses in connection with our own source code to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis any of which could adversely affect our business 

we are dependent on proprietary technology which could result in litigation that could divert significant valuable resources 

our future success and competitive position is dependent upon our proprietary technology and we rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property the patents owned or licensed by us may be invalidated circumvented infringed or challenged the rights granted under these patents may not provide competitive advantages to us any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us if at all 

despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain our software or develop software with the same functionality or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology duplicate our technology or design around the patents owned by us in addition effective copyright patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in certain countries the steps taken by us to protect our technology might not prevent the misappropriation of such technology 

the value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many current patent filings third parties may claim that we or our customers some of whom are indemnified by us are infringing their intellectual property rights for example individuals and groups may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from us or our customers the number of these types of claims has increased in recent years as new patents are issued or are brought to our attention by the holders of such patents it may be necessary for us to secure a license from such patent holders redesign our products or withdraw products from the market in addition the legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant expense of operations any such litigation could require us to incur substantial costs and divert significant valuable resources including the efforts of our technical and management personnel which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on the availability and unimpaired use of allocated bands within the radio frequency spectrum our products may be subject to harmful interference from new or modified spectrum uses 

our gnss technology is dependent on the use of satellite signals and on terrestrial communication bands international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union “itu” a specialized technical agency of the united nations these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference each country also has regulatory authority over how each band is used in the country in the united states the federal communications commission “fcc” and the national telecommunications and information administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations 

any itu or local reallocation of radio frequency bands including frequency band segmentation and sharing of spectrum or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant adverse impacts on our customers both of which could reduce demand for our products for example in 2020 the fcc approved a proposal by a private party to repurpose spectrum adjacent to the authorized gnss bands for terrestrial wireless operations throughout the united states the company has opposed and continues to oppose this proposal along with a wide range of participants in commercial and governmental sectors that rely on the use of gnss in their critical activities the fcc’s action is subject to further review as well as potential legislative action if the fcc’s action continues in effect and terrestrial operations are implemented in the affected spectrum these operations could create harmful interference to gnss receivers in proximity to such operations and impose costs to retrofit or replace affected receivers similarly other countries have considered proposals for use of frequencies used by our products as well as adjacent bands that could cause harmful interference to our products 

many of our products use other radio frequency bands such as the public land mobile radio bands together with the gnss signal to provide enhanced gnss capabilities such as realtime kinematics precision the continuing availability of these nongnss radio frequencies is essential to provide enhanced gnss products to our precision survey agriculture and construction machine controls markets in addition transmissions and emissions from other services and equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or inband may impair the utility and reliability of our products any regulatory changes in spectrum allocation or in allowable operating conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

many of our products rely on gnss technology gps and other satellite systems which may become degraded or inoperable and result in lost revenue 

gnss technology gps satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible intentional disruption many of the gps satellites currently in orbit were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of operational satellites in orbit some have been in operation for 15 years or more repair of damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites a reduction in the number of operating satellites below the 24satellite standard established for gps may impair the utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities in addition software updates to gps satellites and ground control segments and infrequent known events such as gps week number rollover may adversely affect our products and customers we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of system updates to mitigate these problems which may not be available or complete 

we are dependent on continued operation of gps the principal gnss currently in operation the gps constellation is operated by the u s government which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps if supporting policies were to change or if user fees were imposed it could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

many of our products also use signals from systems that augment gps such as the wide area augmentation system and national differential gps system and satellites transmitting signal corrections data on mobile satellite services frequencies utilized by our rtx corrections services some of these augmentation systems are operated by the us government and rely on continued funding and maintenance of these systems any curtailment of the operating capability of these systems or limitations on access to or use of the signals or discontinuance of service could result in degradation of our services or product performance with an adverse effect on our business 

many of our products use satellite signals from the russian glonass china’s beidou and the european galileo gnss systems other countries such as india are in the process of creating their own gnss systems and we either have developed or will develop products that use gnss signals from these systems national or european authorities may provide preferential access to signals to companies associated with their markets including our competitors which could harm our competitive position use of nonus gnss signals are also subject to fcc waiver requirements and to restrictions based upon international trade or geopolitical considerations if we are unable to develop timely and competitive commercial products using these systems or obtain timely and equal access to service signals this could result in lost revenue these authorities may also adopt protectionist measures favoring national companies who make use of their gnss systems to the detriment of our products using the us gps system which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

regulatory risks 

we face risks inherent in conducting business internationally including compliance with international and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations 

these laws and regulations include data privacy requirements labor relations laws tax laws anticompetition regulations import and trade restrictions export control laws and laws that prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers including the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act and other anticorruption laws that have been the subject of a substantial increase in global enforcement many of our products are subject to us export law restrictions that limit the destinations and types of customers to which our products may be sold or that require an export license in connection with sales outside the united states given the high level of complexity of these laws there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently or intentionally breached for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise also we may be held liable for actions taken by our local dealers and partners violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees and prohibitions or conditions on the conduct of our business any such violations could include prohibitions or conditions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our results of operations 

we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced significant governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices we may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence or through other methods that relevant law and regulations prohibit us from using our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties 

we are subject to evolving privacy laws in the united states and other jurisdictions that are subject to potentially differing interpretations and which could adversely impact our business and require that we incur substantial costs 

existing privacyrelated laws and regulations in the united states and other countries are evolving and are subject to potentially differing interpretations and various us federal and state or other international legislative and regulatory bodies may expand or enact laws regarding privacy and data securityrelated matters new privacy laws have come into effect in brazil and new zealand in 2020 and in china in 2021 and revisions of privacy laws are currently pending in countries like canada and india some countries are considering or have passed legislation that requires local storage and processing of data including geospatial data which could impact our ability to deliver cloudbased solutions in an efficient manner the us and european union have not yet managed to replace the euus privacy shield as a basis for data transfers from the eu to the us international transfers of personal data present ongoing compliance challenges and complicate our business transactions and operations in addition the california consumer privacy act the “ccpa” which took effect in january 2020 was amended by the california privacy rights act “the “cpra” and will take full effect in january 2023 the ccpa and cpra among other things gives california residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used other us states and the us congress have introduced and some states like virginia and colorado have enacted in 2021 data privacy legislation which may impact our business data privacy legislation amendments and revisions to existing data privacy legislation and other developments impacting data privacy and data protection may require us to modify our data processing 

practices and policies increase the complexity of providing our products and services and cause us to incur substantial costs in an effort to comply failure to comply may lead to significant fines and business interruption 

we are subject to the impact of governmental and other certifications processes and regulations which could adversely affect our products and our business 

we market many products that are subject to governmental regulations and certifications before they can be sold the european union increasingly regulates the use of our products on agriculture construction and other types of machinery as we develop and enhance features which support automated and autonomous operation of our products we are increasingly subject to functional safety regulation ce certification is required for gnss receivers and data communications products which must also conform to the european harmonized gnss receiver requirements and the radio equipment directive to be sold in the european community in the future the us european or other governmental authorities may propose gps receiver testing and certification for compliance with published gps signal interface or other specifications governmental authorities may also propose other forms of gps receiver performance standards which may limit design alternatives hamper product innovation or impose additional costs some of our products that use integrated radio communication technology require product type certification and some products require an end user to obtain licensing from the fcc and other national authorities for frequencyband usage compliance with evolving product regulations in our major markets could require that we redesign our products cease selling products in certain markets and increase our costs of product development an inability to obtain required certifications in a timely manner could adversely affect our ability to bring our products to market and harm our customer relationships failure to comply with evolving requirements could result in fines and limitations on sales of our products 

financial and tax risks 

our debt could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations 

at the end of 2021 our total debt was comprised primarily of senior notes of approximately 13 billion when our senior notes mature we will have to utilize significant resources to repay these senior notes or seek to refinance them if we decide to refinance the senior notes we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the senior notes at all both of which may adversely affect our financial condition any downgrade by credit rating agencies could adversely affect our cost of borrowing limit our access to the capital markets or result in more restrictive covenants in future debt agreements 

our outstanding indebtedness could have other important consequences such as 

• requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations and other capital resources to debt service thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital capital expenditures general corporate purposes and other cash requirements particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

• reducing our ability to make investments and acquisitions which support the growth of the company or to repurchase shares of our common stock and 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes and opportunities in our industry which may place us at a competitive disadvantage 

there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and we may not be able to repay the indebtedness that becomes due a default under our debt instruments may also significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control a portion of our outstanding debt has interest rates that float based on prevailing interest rates and we may incur additional variablerate debt in the future such rates tend to fluctuate based on general economic conditions general interest rates federal reserve rates and the supply of and demand for credit in the relevant interbanking market if interest rates increase our interest expense will also increase as would the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness or obtaining new debt 

our ability to incur additional indebtedness over time may be limited due to applicable financial covenants and restrictions and due to the risk that significantly increasing our level of indebtedness could impact the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations which in turn would increase the interest rates and fees that we pay in connection with our indebtedness 

changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income in future periods 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities while we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business it is possible that these positions may be contested or overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities which may have a significant impact on our global provision for income taxes our effective tax rate is primarily subject to the geographic mix of earnings statutory rates intercompany transfer pricing and enacted tax laws 

a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates including 

• the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed 

• the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with the us and foreign tax authorities 

• changes in our intercompany transfer pricing methodology 

• changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 

• increases in expense not deductible for tax purposes including transaction costs and impairments of goodwill in connection with acquisitions 

• changes in the realizability of available tax credits 

• changes in sharebased compensation 

• changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and 

• changes in generally accepted accounting principles 

tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied and governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies 

the jurisdictions where we do business may change tax laws regulations and interpretations on a prospective or retroactive basis and these potential changes could adversely affect our effective tax rates as these and other tax laws and related regulations change our financial results could be materially impacted given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow but such changes could impact our financial results 

in october 2021 the organization of economic cooperation and development “oecd” announced that many world leaders tentatively signed on to a framework that imposes a minimum tax of 15 to certain multinational enterprises we will continue to monitor and assess how this may impact our financial results if and when implemented 

we are currently in various stages of multiple year examinations by state and foreign taxing authorities if taxing authorities of any jurisdiction were to successfully challenge a material tax position we could become subject to higher taxes and our earnings could be adversely affected 

we may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates although the majority of our sales are transacted in us dollars expenses may be paid in local currencies an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the us where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses procurement of raw materials from sources outside the us and overseas capital expenditures we also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies our foreign exchange forward contracts reduce but do not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements therefore changes in exchange rates could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to ownership of our stock 

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect an investment in our common stock 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile during 2021 our stock price ranged from 6591 to 9572 we believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate perhaps substantially including 

• general conditions in the worldwide economy 

• quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results and order levels 

• announcements and reports of developments related to our business our major customers and partners and the industries in which we compete or the industries in which our customers compete 

• security breaches 

• acquisition announcements 

• new products or product enhancements announced or introduced by us or our competitors 

• disputes with respect to developments in patents or other intellectual property rights 

• developments in our relationships with our partners customers and suppliers 

• the imposition of tariffs or other trade barriers 

• political economic or social uncertainty 

• global pandemics like the covid19 pandemic and 

• acts of terrorism 

in addition the stock market in general and the markets for shares of “hightech” companies in particular have frequently experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate which could adversely impact our operations financial results and stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control results in any period could be affected by 

• changes in market demand 

• competitive market conditions 

• supply chain disruptions 

• the timing of recognizing revenue 

• fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

• the cost and availability of components 

• the mix of our customer base and sales channels 

• the mix of products sold 

• pricing of products 

• changes in the us or foreign policies on taxes trade or spending 

• regional responses and restrictions related to global pandemics like the covid19 pandemic and 

• other risks including those described below 

seasonal variations in demand for our products may also affect our quarterly results construction equipment revenue has historically been the highest in early spring our agricultural equipment revenue has historically been the highest in the first quarter followed by the second quarter reflecting buying in anticipation of the spring planting season in the northern hemisphere if we do not accurately forecast seasonal demand we may be left with unsold inventory or have a shortage of inventory which could adversely impact our results of operations 

due in part to the buying patterns of our customers a portion of our hardware revenue occurs from orders received and immediately shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of each quarter while our operating expense tends to remain fairly predictable these patterns could harm our operating results if for any reason expected sales are deferred orders are not received or shipments are delayed a few days at the end of a quarter 

the price of our common stock could decline substantially in the event any of these risks result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors which are based on historical and predictive models that are not necessarily accurate representations of the future 

general risk factors 

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes 

we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct business litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes can be difficult to predict management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability or may suffer unforeseen liabilities which could then impact the results of a financial period a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable which if not expected could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions could disrupt our operations 

acts of war acts of terrorism or civil unrest natural disasters and other catastrophic events especially any events that impact our larger markets or gnss signals or systems could have a material adverse impact on our business the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military activity in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism or hostilities may involve a redeployment of the satellites used in gnss or interruptions of the system civil unrest local conflicts or other political instability may adversely impact regional economies cause work stoppages or result in limitations on business transactions with the affected jurisdictions to the extent that such interruptions result in delays or the cancellation of orders disruption of the manufacturing or shipment of our products or reduced demand for our products these interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

future public health crises and epidemics could impact our international operations and sales 

our results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent that future pandemics similar to covid19 or any other epidemic harm any significant market where we do business contagious disease epidemics or global pandemics could also significantly impact our international supply chain and result in component and product shortages and general disruptions to the economy such outbreaks could also result in mass quarantines business closures and significantly impact our suppliers customers and commercial partners in affected areas which may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

damage to our reputation could significantly harm our businesses competitive position and prospects for growth 

our ability to attract and retain investors customers and employees could be adversely affected by damage to our reputation resulting from various sources including environmental social and governance “esg” related issues employee misconduct litigation or regulatory outcomes failure to deliver minimum standards of service and quality compliance failures unethical behavior unintended breach of confidential information and the activities of our customers and commercial partners 

in addition we are committed to aligning our purpose culture and corporate strategy with sustainability any perceived change in our dedication to these commitments could harm our reputation and could adversely impact our business our disclosures on these matters and standards we set for ourselves or a failure to meet these standards may influence our reputation and the value of our brand 

for example we have elected to share publicly our commitments and ongoing efforts in our sustainability report where we address the importance of esg matters to our stakeholders and our company our business may face increased scrutiny related to these activities including from the investment community and our failure to achieve progress in these areas on a timely basis or at all could adversely affect our reputation business financial performance and growth 

climate change may have an impact on our business 

while we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change by establishing robust environmental programs and partnering with organizations who are also focused on mitigating their own climaterelated risks we recognize that there are inherent climaterelated risks wherever business is conducted any of our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change the recent wildfires in colorado occurred in close proximity to our offices in westminster colorado our california headquarters has historically experienced and is projected to continue to experience climaterelated events at an increasing frequency including drought water scarcity heat waves wildfires and resultant air quality impacts and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention furthermore it is more difficult to mitigate the impact of these events on our employees while they work from home as a result of the covid19 pandemic changing market dynamics global policy developments and the increasing frequency and impact of extreme weather events on critical infrastructure in the us and elsewhere have the potential to disrupt our business the business of our thirdparty suppliers and the business of our customers and may cause us to experience higher attrition losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations

none 




 item 2 properties 

our corporate headquarters is located in sunnyvale california where we lease approximately 139 thousand square feet we also currently own approximately 316 thousand square feet in dayton ohio and 250 thousand square feet in westminster colorado these facilities are used by all reporting segments for financial information regarding leases refer to note 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

we believe that our existing facilities are adequate to support current and nearterm operations 




 item 3 legal proceedings

company stock performance 

our common stock trades on nasdaq under the symbol “trmb” the following graph compares the cumulative fiveyear total return provided stockholders on our common stock relative to the cumulative total returns of the sp 500 index the sp 500 information technology index the sp 500 industrials index and the nasdaq composite index an investment of 100 with reinvestment of all dividends is assumed to have been made in our common stock and in each of the indexes on december 31 2016 and its relative performance is tracked through december 31 2021 

trimble was added to the sp 500 during 2021 we also added the sp 500 industrials index as both sp 500 information technology and sp 500 industrials provide a better comparison with trimble’s stock than either index individually 

stock repurchase program 

the following table provides information relating to our purchase of equity securities for the fourth quarter of 2021  



in august 2021 our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program “2021 stock repurchase program” authorizing up to 7500 million in repurchases of our common stock under the 2021 stock repurchase program the share repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and supersedes and replaces the 6000 million share repurchase authorization approved by our board of directors in november 2017 “2017 stock repurchase program” of which 507 million was remaining and has been cancelled 

under the 2021 stock repurchase program we may repurchase shares from time to time subject to business and market conditions and other investment opportunities through open market transactions privatelynegotiated transactions accelerated stock repurchase plans or by other means the timing and actual number of any shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including market conditions our share price other available uses of capital applicable legal requirements and other factors the 2021 stock repurchase program may be suspended modified or discontinued at any time at without prior notice 

during 2021 we repurchased approximately 21 million shares of common stock in open market purchases under our 2017 and 2021 stock repurchase programs at an average price of 8575 per share for a total of 1800 million at the end of 2021 the 2021 stock repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of 6100 million 

as of february 18 2022 there were approximately 520 holders of record of our common stock 

dividend policy 

we have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock during any period for which financial information is provided in this annual report on form 10k at this time we intend to retain future earnings if any to fund the development and growth of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that reflect our plans estimates and beliefs our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and those listed under “risks factors” this section of this annual report on form 10k generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and yeartoyear comparisons between 2021 and 2020 discussions of 2019 items and yeartoyear comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this annual report on form 10k can be found in “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended january 1 2021 

executive level overview 

we are a leading provider of technology solutions that enable professionals and field mobile workers to improve or transform their work processes our comprehensive work process solutions are used across a range of industries including architecture building construction civil engineering geospatial survey and mapping agriculture natural resources utilities transportation and government our representative customers include construction owners contractors engineering and construction firms surveying companies farmers and agricultural companies energy and utility companies trucking companies and state federal and municipal governments further information on our business is presented in part i item 1 “business” 

our growth strategy is centered on multiple elements 

• executing on our connect and scale strategy 

• increasing focus on software and services 

• focus on attractive markets with significant growth and profitability potential 

• domain knowledge and technological innovation that benefit a diverse customer base 

• geographic expansion with localization strategy 

• optimized gotomarket strategies to best access our markets 

• strategic acquisitions 

• venture fund investments and 

• sustainability 

our focus on these growth drivers has led over time to growth in revenue and profitability and an increasingly diversified business model we continue to experience a shift toward a more significant mix of recurring revenue contracts as demonstrated by our success in driving annualized recurring revenue “arr” growth of 9 yearoveryear at the end of 2021 excluding the impact of foreign currency and acquisitions and divestitures arr organic growth was 12  this shift has positively impacted our revenue mix and growth over time and is leading to improved visibility in our businesses our software recurring revenue and services represented 55 of total revenue for 2021 as our solutions have expanded our gotomarket model has also evolved with a balanced mix between direct distribution and oem customers as well as an increasing number of enterprise level customer relationships additionally in august 2021 we announced a newly formed strategic venture fund through this fund we expect to invest up to 200 million in early to growthstage companies that can accelerate innovation and effectively bring new solutions to our customers and industry 

for a full definition of arr as used in this discussion and analysis refer to the “supplemental disclosure of nongaap financial measures and annualized recurring revenue” later in this item 7 

impact of covid19 and supply chain constraints on our business 

covid19 and variant impacts especially related to global supply chain disruptions and parts and labor shortages and increased worldwide demand for certain components continued to impact our business and operations we are experiencing extended delivery times for certain components of our hardware products and increased freight costs as a result we are making binding commitments with longer lead times and procuring components at higher prices which may impact our flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions and product demand currently we expect these challenging supply chain conditions to persist in the near term therefore we will continue to experience delays in shipping our products and increased costs which may reduce our revenue and gross margin and continue to increase our backlog our 2021 results of operations reflect significant revenue improvement as the overall impact of covid19 was less pronounced as a result of covid19 the yeartoyear comparison of 2020 to 2021 reflects significant distortions in growth rates as our business rebounded in 2021 

see “1a risk factors” for further discussion of the possible impact of the covid19 pandemic and its resulting effects on our business 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs of sales operating expenses and related disclosures we consider the accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting policies these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies our accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services revenue is recognized net of allowance for returns and any taxes collected from customers we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations however determining whether products or services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may sometimes require significant judgment 

judgment is required to determine standalone selling price “ssp” for each distinct performance obligation we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when products and services are sold separately and determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services in instances where ssp is not directly observable we determine ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs 

income taxes 

we are a us based multinational company operating in multiple us and foreign jurisdictions judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual tax audit outcomes determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment changes in recognition or measurement of our uncertain tax positions would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

income taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred tax assets or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if we believe it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized 

we are subject to the periodic examination of our domestic and foreign tax returns by the irs state local and foreign tax authorities who may challenge our tax positions we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 

business combinations and valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting whereby certain identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date any purchase consideration in excess of the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill acquisitionrelated expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred 

when determining the fair values of certain assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree we make significant estimates and assumptions especially concerning intangible assets critical estimates when valuing intangible assets include expected future cash flows based on consideration of future growth rates and margins customer attrition rates future changes in technology and brand awareness loyalty and position and discount rates 

we evaluate goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist we utilize either a qualitative or quantitative approach to assess the likelihood of impairment on the first day of the fourth quarter when performing the qualitative approach we consider macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors that may impact the reporting units when performing the quantitative approach we compare the reporting unit’s carrying amount including goodwill to the reporting units fair value the estimation of a reporting units fair value involves using estimates and assumptions including expected future operating performance using riskadjusted discount rates if the reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized 

intangible assets acquired individually with a group of other assets or in a business combination are recorded at fair value our intangible assets are amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straightline method over the estimated useful life which ranges from three to ten years and has a weightedaverage useful life of approximately seven years we write off fully amortized intangible assets when those assets are no longer used 

we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable based on their future cash flows the estimated future cash flows are primarily based on assumptions about expected future operating performance

1 refer to “supplemental disclosure of nongaap financial measures and annualized recurring revenue” of this annual report on form 10k for definitions 

basis of presentation 

we use a 52–53 week fiscal year ending on the friday nearest to december 31 which for 2021 was december 31 2021 both 2021 and 2020 were 52–week years 

year 2021 compared with year 2020 

revenue 

despite supply constraints and increases in our backlog revenue increased due to strong demand for our hardware and related software as compared with reduced demand due to the impacts of covid19 lockdowns in the prior year and strong recovery in 2021 in markets across major regions growth in subscription sales in many of our software businesses continued to remain strong price increases which went into effect in the second half of the year and reduced discounting had a slighter impact on revenue growth for the year 

product revenue increased due to strong hardware and related software sales in geospatial resources and utilities and buildings and infrastructure to a lesser extent transportation sales also contributed to growth service revenue was relatively flat and subscription revenue increased primarily due to strong growth in buildings and infrastructure and to a lesser extent resources and utilities and geospatial slightly offset by a decrease in transportation 

during 2021 sales to customers in north america represente d 51 europe represented 31 asia pacific represented 12 and the rest of world represented 6 of our total revenue 

no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenue in 2021 and 2020 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our accounts receivable at the end of 2021 and 2020 

gross margin 

gross margins varied due to several factors including product mix customer pricing distribution channel and product costs 

gross margin increased primarily due to strong revenue growth gross margin as a percentage of total revenue shows a slight decrease mainly due to increased mix of hardware sales and increased supply chain costs offset by price increases and reduced discounting as well as lower intangibles amortization 

operating income 

operating income and operating income as a percentage of total revenue increased primarily due to strong revenue growth in buildings and infrastructure geospatial and resources and utilities partially offset by a decrease in transportation as well as relative operating expense containment in all segments 

research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 

the following table shows research and development “rd” sales and marketing “sm” and general and administrative “ga” expense along with these expenses as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated 



as a result of covid19 impacts the yeartoyear comparison of 2020 to 2021 reflects distortions in expense growth rates as our expenses normalized in 2021 with the biggest impact due to higher incentive compensation including bonuses and stockbased compensation particularly in ga 

rd expense increased primarily due to higher compensation expense including incentive compensation  

we believe that the development and introduction of new products are critical to our future success and we expect to continue active development of new products 

sm expense increased primarily due to higher compensation expense including incentive compensation and commissions 

ga expense increased primarily due to higher compensation expense including incentive compensation and to a lesser extent higher consulting and legal fees  

amortization of purchased intangible assets 

the following table shows amortization of purchased intangible assets for the periods indicated 



in 2021 total amortization of purchased intangibles decreased primarily due to the expiration of prior year acquisitions amortization 

nonoperating income expense net 

the following table shows nonoperating expense net for the periods indicated 



in 2021 nonoperating income increased primarily due to recognition of gains from the sale of businesses included in other income net and to a lesser extent lower interest costs associated with a decrease in our outstanding debt 

income tax provision 

in december 2021 due to a change in the netherlands tax law the statutory tax rate was further increased from 250 to 258 effective january 1 2022 as a result we recorded a onetime tax benefit of 144 million in 2021 due to the revaluation of the netherlands deferred tax assets 

previously in december 2020 also as a result of a netherlands tax law change that increased netherlands statutory tax rate from 217 to 250 effective january 1 2021 we recorded a onetime tax benefit of 640 million in 2020 due to the revaluation of the netherlands deferred tax assets 

our effective income tax rates for 2021 and 2020 were 142 and 11 respectively the effective income tax rate in 2021 increased compared to 2020 primarily due to the smaller onetime tax benefit recorded in 2021 relating to the revaluation of the netherlands deferred tax assets mentioned above 

results by segment 

we report our financial performance including revenue and operating income based on four reportable segments buildings and infrastructure geospatial resources and utilities and transportation 

our chief executive officer and chief operating decision maker views and evaluates operations based on the results of our reportable operating segments under our management reporting system these results are not necessarily in conformance with us gaap for additional discussion of our segments refer to note 5 of this annual report on form 10k 

the following table shows a breakdown of revenue and operating income by segment for the periods indicated 



the following table shows a reconciliation of our consolidated segment operating income to our consolidated income before income taxes for the periods indicated 



buildings and infrastructure 

revenue increased primarily due to strong demand for our civil construction hardware and related software and from strong recovery in markets across major regions including strong residential construction and infrastructure spend additionally higher subscription revenue in our software businesses benefited from the continued cumulative effect of conversions from perpetual licenses to subscription offerings for existing and new customers as well as improvements in our customer churn rate 

segment operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenue increased primarily due to higher revenue consistent gross margin and operating cost containment increased supply chain costs for hardware products were wholly mitigated by reduced discounting and customer price increases 

geospatial 

revenue increased primarily due to strong demand for geospatial survey products with strong recovery in markets across major regions including strong residential construction infrastructure and utilities spend competitive products including the r12i helped win business 

segment operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenue increased primarily due to higher revenue and operating cost containment partially offset by lower gross margin gross margin was down primarily due to product mix and increased supply chain costs for hardware products partially offset by reduced discounting and customer price increases 

resources and utilities 

revenue increased primarily due to continued agriculture business strength in the reseller and oem channels in markets across major regions strong market fundamentals including favorable commodity prices continued to fuel growth 

segment operating income increased primarily due to higher revenue and operating expense containment gross margin was down due to product mix and higher supply chain costs for hardware products partially offset by reduced discounting and customer price increases operating income as a percentage of revenue was down due to lower gross margin 

transportation 

revenue decreased slightly due to the impact of a divestiture largely offset by continued growth in enterprise software sales enterprise revenue continued to experience subscription revenue growth as the business transitions from a perpetual software license model mobility sales were down due to reduced subscriber counts partially offset by higher hardware shipments for the year 

segment operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly primarily due to the revenue decline and a slight increase in operating expense 

liquidity and capital resources 



operating activities 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher net income adjusted for noncash items and higher account payables partially offset by higher inventory purchases 

investing activities 

the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to higher net proceeds from the sale of businesses and sale of property and equipment during 2021  partially offset by slightly higher acquisition spending in 2021 the current year included the agileassets acquisition compared to the prior year which included the kuebix acquisition 

financing activities 

the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by an increase in repurchases of common stock partially offset by a decrease in debt repayments net of debt proceeds 

cash and cash equivalents 

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and borrowings along with cash provided by operations will be sufficient in the foreseeable future to meet our anticipated operating cash needs expenditures related to our connect and scale strategy debt service and any stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program for debt refinancing we anticipate we will have readily accessible capital markets in order to secure appropriate funding 

our material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations and cash needs 

leases 

we have operating leases primarily for certain of our major facilities including corporate offices research and development facilities and manufacturing facilities operating leases represent undiscounted lease payments and include shortterm leases at the end of 2021 we had fixed lease payment obligations of 1907 million with 505 million payable within the next 12 months refer to note 7 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our leases

in addition we have unrecognized tax benefits of 633 million included in other noncurrent liabilities including interest and penalties at this time we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with tax authorities regarding this liability and therefore such amounts are not included in the contractual obligations table above refer to note 11 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our taxes 

other purchase obligations and commitments 

purchase obligations and commitments primarily relate to investments in our platform associated with our connect and scale strategy and noncancellable inventory commitments which increased due to the extension of lead times and the growth of our hardware business at the end of 2021 we had operating purchase obligations and commitments of 7108 million with 4466 million payable within the next 12 months refer to note 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our purchase obligations and commitments other than the items discussed above we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities

during 2021 we repaid 2510 million of debt including the full repayment of our term loan net of borrowings refer to note 6 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our debt 

stock repurchase program

effect of new accounting pronouncements 

the impact of recent accounting pronouncements is disclosed in note 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

s upplemental disclosure of nongaap financial measures and annualized recurring revenue 

to supplement our consolidated financial information we included nongaap financial measures which are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap because we believe nongaap financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding our “core operating performance” which excludes the effect of noncash items and certain variable charges not expected to recur not meaningful in comparison to our past operating performance or not reflective of ongoing financial results lastly we believe that our core operating performance offers a supplemental measure for periodtoperiod comparisons and can be used to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance as well as our performance relative to competitors in addition to providing nongaap financial measures we disclose annualized recurring revenue “arr” to give the investors supplementary indicators of the value of our current recurring revenue contracts 

arr represents the estimated annualized value of recurring revenue including subscription maintenance and support revenue and term license contracts for the quarter arr is calculated by adding the portion of the contract value of all of our term licenses attributable to the current quarter to our nongaap recurring revenue for the current quarter and dividing that sum by the number of days in the quarter and then multiplying that quotient by 365 arr should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as it is a performance measure and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items 

the nongaap financial measures definitions and explanations to the adjustments to comparable gaap measures are included below 





nongaap definitions 

nongaap revenue 

we define nongaap revenue as gaap revenue excluding the effects of purchase accounting adjustments we believe this measure helps investors understand the performance of our business including acquisitions as nongaap revenue excludes the effects of certain acquired deferred revenue that was written down to fair value in purchase accounting management believes that excluding fair value purchase accounting adjustments more closely correlates with the ordinary and ongoing course of the acquired company’s operations and facilitates analysis of revenue growth and trends 

nongaap gross margin 

we define nongaap gross margin as gaap gross margin excluding the effects of purchase accounting adjustments acquisitiondivestiture items stockbased compensation deferred compensation and restructuring and other costs we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap gross margin as a way of understanding how product mix pricing decisions and manufacturing costs influence our business 

nongaap operating expenses 

we define nongaap operating expenses as gaap operating expenses excluding the effects of purchase accounting adjustments acquisitiondivestiture items stockbased compensation deferred compensation and restructuring and other costs 

we believe this measure is important to investors evaluating our nongaap spending in relation to revenue 

nongaap operating income 

we define nongaap operating income as gaap operating income excluding the effects of purchase accounting adjustments acquisitiondivestiture items stockbased compensation deferred compensation and restructuring and other costs we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap operating income trends which are driven by revenue gross margin and spending 

nongaap nonoperating expense net 

we define nongaap nonoperating expenses net as gaap nonoperating expenses net excluding acquisitiondivestiture items and deferred compensation we believe this measure helps investors evaluate our nonoperating expense trends 

nongaap income tax provision 

we define nongaap income tax provision as gaap income tax provision excluding charges and benefits such as net deferred tax impacts resulting from the nonus intercompany transfer of intellectual property tax law changes and significant onetime reserve releases upon the statute of limitations expirations we believe this measure helps investors because it provides for consistent treatment of excluded items in our nongaap presentation and a difference in the gaap and nongaap tax rates 

nongaap net income 

we define nongaap net income as gaap net income excluding the effects of purchase accounting adjustments acquisitiondivestiture items stockbased compensation restructuring and other costs and nongaap tax adjustments this measure provides a supplemental view of net income trends which are driven by nongaap income before taxes and our nongaap tax rate 

nongaap diluted net income per share 

we defined nongaap diluted net income per share as gaap diluted net income per share excluding the effects of purchase accounting adjustments acquisitiondivestiture items stockbased compensation restructuring and other costs and nongaap tax adjustments we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap operating performance as reflected in a per share calculation as a way of measuring nongaap operating performance by ownership in the company 

adjusted ebitda 

we define adjusted ebitda as nongaap operating income plus depreciation expense and income from equity method investments net other companies may define adjusted ebitda differently adjusted ebitda is not intended to purport to be an alternative to net income or operating income as a measure of operating performance or cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity adjusted ebitda is a performance measure that we believe offers a useful view of the overall operations of our business because it facilitates operating performance comparisons by removing potential differences 

caused by variations unrelated to operating performance such as capital structures interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization expenses 

explanations of nongaap adjustments 

a purchase accounting adjustments  purchase accounting adjustments consist of the following 

i acquired deferred revenue adjustment  we adopted asu 202108 in the fourth quarter of 2021 for all acquisitions occurring in 2021 which requires the application of asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities on the acquisition date for acquisitions occurring prior to 2021 nongaap revenue excludes the adjustment to our revenue as a result of measuring the contract liability at fair value on the acquisition date 

ii amortization of acquired capitalized commissions  purchase accounting generally requires entities to eliminate capitalized sales commissions balances as of the acquisition date nongaap operating expenses exclude the adjustments that eliminate the capitalized sales commissions f or acquisitions occurring prior to 2021 nongaap operating expenses exclude the adjustment of ac quired capitalized commissions amortization 

iii amortization of purchased intangible assets  nongaap gross margin and operating expenses exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets which primarily represents technology andor customer relationships already developed 

b acquisition  divestiture items  nongaap gross margin and operating expenses exclude acquisition costs consisting of external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition and strategic investment activities such as legal due diligence integration and other closing costs including the acceleration of acquisition stock options and adjustments to the fair value of earnout liabilities non gaap nonoperating expense net exclude unusual onetime acquisitiondivestiture charges andor divestiture gainslosses the costs that have been excluded from the nongaap measures are costs specific to particular acquisitions as a result these are onetime costs that vary significantly in amount and timing and are not indicative of our core operating performance 

c stockbased compensation  deferred compensation  nongaap gross margin and operating expenses exclude stockbased compensation and income or expense associated with movement in our nonqualified deferred compensation plan liabilities changes in nonqualified deferred compensation plan assets included in nonoperating expense net offset the income or expense in the plan liabilities 

d restructuring and other costs non gaap gross margin and operating expenses exclude restructuring and other exit costs comprised of termination benefits related to reductions in employee headcount including executive severance agreements the closure or exit of facilities and cancellation of certain contracts in addition other costs include covid19 expenses incurred as a direct impact from the covid19 virus pandemic such as cancellation fees of trade shows due to public safety issues additional charges for disinfecting facilities and personal protective equipment 

e nongaap items tax effected  this amount adjusts the provision for income taxes to reflect the effect of the nongaap items a  d on nongaap net income this amount excludes the gaap tax rate impact resulting from the nonus intercompany transfer of intellectual property which is separately disclosed in item g 

f difference in gaap and nongaap tax rate  this amount represents the difference between the gaap and nongaap tax rates applied to the nongaap operating income plus the nongaap nonoperating expense net the gaap tax rate used for this calculation excludes the net deferred tax impacts resulting from the nonus intercompany transfer of intellectual property which is separately disclosed in item g the nongaap tax rate excludes charges and benefits such as net deferred tax impacts resulting from a nonus intercompany transfer of intellectual property and significant onetime reserve releases upon statute of limitations expirations 

g ip restructuring and tax law change impacts these amounts represent net deferred tax impacts resulting from a nonus intercompany transfer of intellectual property consistent with tax law changes including tax rates changes and our international business operations 

h gaap and nongaap tax rate percentages  these percentages are defined as gaap income tax provision as a percentage of gaap income before taxes and nongaap income tax provision as a percentage of nongaap income before taxes 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors 

market interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents consisted primarily of interest and noninterest bearing bank deposits as well as bank time deposits the main objective of these instruments is safety of principal and liquidity while maximizing return without significantly increasing risk 

due to the nature of our cash equivalents that they are readily convertible to cash we do not anticipate any material effect on our portfolio due to fluctuations in interest rates 

we are exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing interest rates under our credit facilities our 2018 credit facility includes a fiveyear revolving loan facility with a maturity date of may 2023 we also have four unsecured uncommitted revolving credit facilities that are callable by the bank at any time we may borrow funds under the 2018 credit facility in us dollars euros or in certain other agreed currencies as described in note 6 of this annual report on form 10 ‑ k 

at the end of 2021 we had one £550 million two 750 million and one €1000 million revolving credit facilities which are uncommitted at the end of 2021 we do not have any outstanding balance on our revolving credit facilities 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we operate in international markets which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and various foreign currencies the most significant of which is the euro in addition volatile market conditions arising from the covid19 pandemic could result in changes in exchange rates 

historically the majority of our revenue contracts are denominated in us dollars with the most significant exception being europe where we invoice primarily in euro additionally a portion of our expenses primarily the cost to manufacture cost of personnel to deliver technical support on our products and professional services sales and sales support and research and development are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the euro 

revenue resulting from selling in local currencies and costs incurred in local currencies are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which can affect our operating income as exchange rates vary operating income may differ from expectations in 2021 revenue and operating income were favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates by 438 million and 43 million 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash debt and certain trade and intercompany receivables and payables primarily denominated in euro new zealand dollars canadian dollars british pound and brazilian real these contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rate movements as the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses on the forward contracts these instruments are markedtomarket through earnings every period and generally range from one to two months in maturity we do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes we occasionally enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase price of some of our larger business acquisitions foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at the end of 2021 and 2020 are summarized as follows

 item 1a risk factors 

risks and uncertainties 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k and in any other documents to which we refer you in this form 10k before purchasing our securities the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 

risks related to our business 

our financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic 

our overall performance depends upon domestic and worldwide economic and political conditions the global spread of covid19 has created volatility uncertainty and economic disruption the pandemic has caused and may continue to cause a slowdown in worldwide economic activity decreased demand for products and services and disruptions to global supply chains and financial markets these effects have resulted and may result in additional lost or delayed revenue to us and have disrupted our business operations as we have transitioned to remote working environments restricted employee travel and significantly limited access to and imposed social distancing requirements within our facilities including research and development facilities 

our dealer network suppliers and contract manufacturers have been similarly impacted by the covid19 pandemic in the event of continuing and significant disruptions there is no guarantee that we would be able to find alternative sources of distribution supply or manufacturing which could delay our ability to market source manufacture and ship our products these distribution and supply chain effects may have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and could result in an increase in our costs of production and distribution 

the extent to which covid19 impacts our business operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict including 

• the duration and scope of the pandemic the availability of and timing for distributing vaccines and the efficacy of vaccines including with respect to new strains of the virus and the continuing economic impacts of the pandemic 

• governmental business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic

in addition the impact of covid19 on macroeconomic conditions may impact the proper functioning of financial and capital markets foreign currency exchange rates commodity and energy prices and interest rates even after the covid19 pandemic has subsided we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of any economic recession that has occurred or may occur in the future in regions that fail to fully contain covid19 or suffer a covid19 relapse those markets may not recover as quickly or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate globally and are subject to significant risks in many jurisdictions 

global or regional conditions may harm our financial results we have operations in many countries and a significant portion of our revenue is derived from countries outside of the united states as a result our operations and our financial results including our ability to design develop or sell products may be adversely affected by a number of factors outside of our control including 

• global and local economic conditions 

• the demand and cost of commodities such as corn and oil 

• the strength of the agricultural engineering and construction markets 

• inadequate infrastructure and other disruptions such as supply chain interruptions and largescale outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities transportation data hosting or telecommunications providers

there is inherent risk that political diplomatic or military events could result in trade disruptions including tariffs trade embargoes export restrictions and other trade barriers a significant trade disruption or the establishment or increase of any trade barrier in any area where we do business could increase the cost of our products which could adversely impact the margin that we earn on sales make our products more expensive for customers or create uncertainty around demand for certain types of products which could make our products less competitive and reduce customer demand given the change in us presidential administration and the current political climate there is uncertainty about the trade policies treaties government regulations and tariffs that could apply to trade in addition if there is continuing deterioration in the global economy the economies of the countries or regions where our customers are located or do business or the industries that we or our customers serve the demand for our products and services would likely decrease in addition government or customer efforts attitudes laws or policies may lead to nonus customers favoring domestic suppliers that could compete with or replace our products which would also have an adverse effect on our business changes in economic conditions and political uncertainty surrounding international trade also make it difficult to make financial forecasts any of these factors or any combination of these factors could cause us to miss our financial projections and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

engaging in international business inherently involves a number of other difficulties and risks 

risks associated with engaging in international business include 

• longer payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems 

• difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations 

• differing local customer product preferences and requirements than our us markets and 

• difficulties protecting or procuring intellectual property rights 

these factors or any combination of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to effectively manage our increasingly diverse and complex businesses and operations our ability to generate growth and revenue from new or existing customers may be adversely affected 

because our operations are geographically diverse and increasingly complex our personnel resources and infrastructure could become strained and our reputation in the market and our ability to successfully manage and grow our business may be adversely affected the size complexity and diverse nature of our business and the expansion of our product lines and customer base have placed increased demands on our management and operations and future growth may place additional strains on our resources in the future our ability to effectively compete and to manage our planned future growth will depend on among other things the following 

• maintaining continuity in our senior management and key personnel 

• increasing the productivity of our existing employees 

• attracting retaining training and motivating our employees particularly our technical and management personnel 

• deploying our solutions using thirdparty information systems which may require changes to our applications documentation and operational processes 

• improving our operational financial and management controls and 

• improving our information reporting systems and procedures

we have increasingly diversified the nature of our businesses both organically and by acquisition as a result an increasing amount of our business involves business models that require managerial techniques and skill sets that are different from those required to manage our historical core businesses 

over the last few years we have focused more on subscription models as a result we expect to derive an increasing portion of our revenue in the future from subscriptions the subscription models provide our customers the right to access certain of our software in a hosted environment or use downloaded software for a specified subscription period market acceptance of such offerings is affected by a variety of factors including but not limited to security reliability performance current license terms customer preference and industry adoption socialcommunity engagement customer concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage their data public concerns regarding privacy and the enactment of restrictive laws or regulations we may be unable to successfully support and host our subscription offerings in light of the foregoing risks and uncertainties 

these factors or a combination of these factors could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in our software and subscription businesses may adversely impact our operations and financial results 

an increasing portion of our revenue is generated through software maintenance and subscription revenue which includes saas and new subscription services for integrated solutions our customers have no obligation to renew their agreements for our software maintenance or subscription services after the expiration of their initial contract period which typically ranges from one to three years our customer acquisition and renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including overall economic conditions the health of their businesses competitive offerings and customer dissatisfaction with our services if customers do not renew their contracts for our products our maintenance and subscription revenue will decline and our financial results will suffer any reduction in the number of licenses that we sell even if our customer acquisition rates do not change will have an adverse impact on our future maintenance revenue growth if any of our assumptions about expenses revenue or revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect or our attempts to improve efficiency are not successful our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

we continually reevaluate our software licensing programs and subscription programs including specific license models delivery methods and terms and conditions changes to our licensing programs and subscription programs including the introduction of new subscription services for integrated solutions that include hardware the timing of the release of enhancements upgrades maintenance releases the term of the contract discounts promotions and other factors could impact the timing of the recognition of revenue for our products and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition we may implement different licensing models that require us to recognize licensing fees over a longer period over the last few years we have increasingly offered additional products through a saas model saas revenue is currently recognized ratably over the subscription period any significant increase in the percentage of our business generated from a subscription model could increase the amount of revenue to be recognized over time as opposed to upfront which would delay revenue recognition and have an adverse impact on our operating results in a quarterly period due to these complexities we may not be able to accurately forecast our revenue which could cause us to miss our earnings estimates or revenue projections and adversely impact our stock price 

we may not be able to enter into or maintain important alliances and distribution relationships 

we believe that in certain business opportunities our success will depend on our ability to form and maintain alliances with industry participants such as caterpillar nikon hilti and cnh global our failure to form and maintain such alliances or the preemption or disruption of such alliances by actions of competitors could adversely affect our ability to sell our products to customers our relationships with substantial industry participants such as caterpillar and cnh global are complex and multifaceted and are likely to evolve over time based upon the changing business needs and objectives of the parties evolution of our respective business strategies and diversification of product portfolios may lead to increased competition with our strategic allies placing additional pressure on these relationships since these strategic relationships contribute to significant ongoing business in certain of our important markets changes in these relationships could adversely affect our sales in addition we utilize dealer networks including those affiliated with some of our strategic allies such as caterpillar and cnh global to market sell and service many of our products 

changes in our product mix including increasing provision of subscription services for integrated solutions tailored to the needs of specific vertical markets impose new demands on our distribution channels and may require significant changes in the skills and expertise required to successfully distribute our products and services or the creation of new distribution channels recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in the use and the selling of our technology and product offerings requires significant time and resources in order to develop and expand our distribution channels we must continue to expand and improve our processes and procedures that support our distribution channels including our investment in systems 

table of contents 

and training and those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and difficult to manage the time and expense required for sales and marketing organizations of our channel partners to become familiar with our product offerings including our new product developments and newer types of offering such as subscription programs for integrated solutions that include hardware software maintenance and other recurring services may make it more difficult to introduce those products to endusers and delay enduser adoption which could result in lower revenue 

disruption of dealer coverage within specific geographic or enduser markets could cause difficulties in marketing selling or servicing our products and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations moreover dealers who carry products that compete with our products may focus their inventory purchases and sales efforts on goods provided by competitors due to industry demand or profitability such sourcing decisions can adversely impact our sales financial condition and results of operations 

investing in and integrating new acquisitions could be costly place a significant strain on our management systems and resources or may fail to deliver the expected return on investment which could adversely impact our results of operations 

we typically acquire a number of businesses each year and intend to continue to acquire other businesses acquisitions entail numerous risks including 

• potential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or to realize cost savings or other anticipated benefits from integration 

• loss of key employees or customers of acquired operations 

• difficulty of assimilating geographically dispersed operations and personnel of the acquired companies 

• potential disruption of our business or the acquired business 

• unanticipated expenses related to acquisitions 

• unanticipated difficulties in conforming business practices policies procedures internal controls and financial records of acquisitions with our own business 

• impairment of relationships with employees customers vendors distributors or business partners of either an acquired company or our own business 

• inability to accurately forecast the performance of recently acquired businesses resulting in unforeseen adverse effects on our operating results 

• potential liabilities including liabilities resulting from known or unknown compliance or legal issues associated with an acquired business and 

• adverse accounting impact to our results of operations because of purchase accounting treatment and the business or accounting practices of acquired companies 

any such effects from acquisitions could be costly and place a significant strain on our management systems and resources 

as a result of acquisitions we have significant assets that include goodwill and other purchased intangibles the testing of goodwill and intangibles for impairment under established accounting guidelines requires significant use of judgment and assumptions changes in business conditions or in the prospects or results of operations of the acquired business could require negative adjustments to the valuation of these assets resulting in writeoffs that would adversely affect our results if we divest a business and the proceeds are less than the net book value at the time we would have to write off the difference in addition changes in the operating results or the valuation of companies in which we have investments may have a direct impact on our financial statements or could result in our having to write down the value of such investment 

even if successfully negotiated and closed acquisitions may not yield expected synergies may not advance our business strategy as expected may fall short of expected returnoninvestment targets or may not prove successful or effective for our business companies that we acquire may operate with different cost and margin structures which could further cause fluctuations in our operating results and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face substantial competition in our markets which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our financial condition and results of operations 

our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price quality and performance of our products the effectiveness of our distribution channel and direct sales force the level of customer service the development of new technology and our ability to participate in emerging markets within each of our markets we encounter direct competition from other gnss software optical and laser suppliers and competition may intensify from various larger us and nonus competitors and new market entrants particularly from markets such as china our products which commonly use gnss for basic location information may be subject to competition from alternative location technologies such as simultaneous location and mapping technology in our software and subscription services businesses we face competition from a group of large wellestablished companies particularly in the areas of design enterprise resource planning erp collaboration and project management solutions our integrated hardware and software products may be subject to increasing competition from mass

market devices such as smartphones and tablets used in conjunction with relatively inexpensive applications which have not been heavily used for commercial applications in the past these developments may require us to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes that we have not previously been exposed to including those related to cloud computing mobile devices and new computing platforms such competition has in the past resulted and in the future may result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the future against existing and additional competitors will depend largely on our ability to execute our strategy to provide products with significantly differentiated features compared to currently available products we may not be able to implement this strategy successfully and our products may not be competitive with other technologies or products that may be developed by our competitors many of whom have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing sales and other resources than we do 

risks related to our technology and products 

our products are highly technical and may contain undetected errors product defects security vulnerabilities or software errors 

our products including our software products are highly technical and complex and when deployed may contain errors defects or security vulnerabilities we must develop our products quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing market and we have a history of frequently introducing new products products and services as sophisticated as ours could contain undetected errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new models or versions are released such occurrences could result in damage to our reputation lost revenue diverted development resources increased customer service and support costs warranty claims and litigation 

we warrant that our products will be free of defect for various periods of time depending on the product in addition certain of our contracts include epidemic failure clauses if invoked these clauses may entitle the customer to return or obtain credits for products and inventory or to cancel outstanding purchase orders even if the products themselves are not defective 

errors viruses or bugs may be present in software or hardware that we acquire or license from third parties and incorporate into our products or in third party software or hardware that our customers use in conjunction with our products our customers’ proprietary software and network firewall protections may corrupt data from our products and create difficulties in implementing our solutions changes to third party software or hardware that our customers use in conjunction with our software could also render our applications inoperable any errors defects or security vulnerabilities in our products or any defects in or compatibility issues with any thirdparty hardware or software or customers’ network environments discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in revenue recognition loss of customers theft of trade secrets data or intellectual property and increased service and warranty cost any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products alone or in combination with third party hardware or software could expose them to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses and other malicious software programs that could attack our products actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could harm our reputation and lead some customers to return products to reduce or delay future purchases or use competitive products 

our internal and customerfacing systems and systems of third parties we rely upon may be subject to cybersecurity breaches disruptions or delays 

a cybersecurity incident in our own systems or the systems of our thirdparty providers may compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of our own internal data the availability of our products and websites designed to support our customers or our customer data computer hackers foreign governments or cyber terrorists may attempt to or succeed in penetrating our network security and our website the recent discovery of widescale cybersecurity intrusions into us government and private company computer networks by alleged russian state actors underscores the ongoing threat posed by sophisticated and foreign statesponsored attacks unauthorized access to our proprietary business information or customer data may be obtained through breakins sabotage breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks employee theft or misuse breach of the security of the networks of our thirdparty providers or other misconduct additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data 

table of contents 

we have experienced security breaches in the past and despite our efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our systems it is impossible to eliminate this risk because the techniques used by computer hackers who may attempt to penetrate and sabotage our network security or our website change frequently they may take advantage of weaknesses in thirdparty technology or standards of which we are unaware or that we do not control and may not be recognized until long after they have been launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate or counter these techniques it is also possible that unauthorized access to customer data or confidential information may be obtained through inadequate use of security controls by customers vendors or business partners efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop implement and maintain such efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated and may limit the functionality of or otherwise adversely impact our service offering and systems a cybersecurity incident affecting our systems may also result in theft of our intellectual property proprietary data or trade secrets which would compromise our competitive position reputation and operating results we also may be required to notify regulators about any actual or perceived personal data breach including the eu lead data protection authority as well as the individuals who are affected by the incident within strict time periods 

the systems we rely upon also remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from a number of other factors including access to the internet the failure of our network or software systems or significant variability in visitor traffic on our product websites earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunication failures computer viruses human error and similar events or disruptions some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities our systems are also subject to intentional acts of vandalism despite any precautions we may take the occurrence of a natural disaster a decision by any of our thirdparty hosting providers to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could cause system interruptions and delays and result in loss of critical data and lengthy interruptions in our services 

we rely on our information systems and those of third parties for activities such as processing customer orders delivery of products hosting and providing services and support to our customers billing and tracking our customers hosting and managing our customer data and otherwise running our business any disruptions or unexpected incompatibilities in our information systems and those of the third parties upon whom we rely could have a significant impact on our business 

an increasing portion of our revenue comes from saas solutions and other hosted services in which we store retrieve communicate and manage data that is critical to our customers’ business systems disruption of our systems that support these services and solutions could cause disruptions in our customers’ systems and in the businesses that rely on these systems any such disruptions could harm our reputation create liabilities to our customers hurt demand for our services and solutions and adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on new products and services and if we are unable to successfully introduce them into the market or to effectively compete with new disruptive product alternatives our customer base may decline or fail to grow as anticipated 

our future revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to bring new products and services to market on a timely basis we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products and services enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance of such products and services we may encounter problems in the future in innovating and introducing new products and services our development stage products may not be successfully completed or if developed may not achieve significant customer acceptance development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and we might not achieve our goals as to the timing of introducing new technology products or could encounter increased costs the timely availability and costeffective production of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success if we are unable to introduce new products and services if other companies develop competing technology products and services or if we do not develop compelling new products and services our number of customers may not grow as anticipated or may decline which could harm our operating results many of our offerings are increasingly focused on software and subscription services the software industry is characterized by rapidly changing customer preferences which require us to address multiple delivery platforms new mobile devices and cloud computing life cycles of software products can be short and this can exacerbate the risks associated with developing new products the introduction of thirdparty solutions embodying new disruptive technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could make our existing and future software solutions and other products obsolete or noncompetitive if we are not able to develop software and other solutions that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers or if we are unable to adapt to new platforms technologies or new industry standards that impact our markets our ability to retain or increase market share and results of operations could be adversely affected 

table of contents 

some of our products rely on third party technologies including open source software which could result in product incompatibilities or harm availability of our products and services 

we license software technologies and intellectual property underlying some of our software from third parties the thirdparty licenses we rely upon may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all and the software and technologies may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors resulting in development delays some software licenses are subject to annual renewals at the discretion of the licensors in some cases if we were to breach a provision of these license agreements the licensor could terminate the agreement immediately the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such thirdparty software or technology could result in increased costs or delays in software releases or updates until such issues have been resolved this could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also incorporate open source software into our products although we monitor our use of open source software the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market or sell our products or to develop new products in such event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products to disclose and offer royaltyfree licenses in connection with our own source code to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis any of which could adversely affect our business 

we are dependent on proprietary technology which could result in litigation that could divert significant valuable resources 

our future success and competitive position is dependent upon our proprietary technology and we rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property the patents owned or licensed by us may be invalidated circumvented infringed or challenged the rights granted under these patents may not provide competitive advantages to us any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us if at all 

despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain our software or develop software with the same functionality or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology duplicate our technology or design around the patents owned by us in addition effective copyright patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in certain countries the steps taken by us to protect our technology might not prevent the misappropriation of such technology 

the value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many current patent filings third parties may claim that we or our customers some of whom are indemnified by us are infringing their intellectual property rights for example individuals and groups may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from us or our customers the number of these claims has increased in recent years as new patents are issued or are brought to our attention by the holders of such patents it may be necessary for us to secure a license from such patent holders redesign our products or withdraw products from the market in addition the legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant expense of operations any such litigation could require us to incur substantial costs and divert significant valuable resources including the efforts of our technical and management personnel which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations

we are dependent on limited source manufacturers and suppliers for certain of our products and critical components a disruption in our supply chain could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 

we are dependent upon a limited number of contract manufacturers for the manufacture testing and assembly of certain products and specific suppliers for a number of our critical components our current reliance on a limited group of suppliers and contract manufacturers involves risks including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required products or components to meet customers’ delivery requirements a risk that we may accumulate excess inventories if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products reduced control over pricing and delivery schedules discontinuation of or increased prices for certain components and economic conditions that may adversely impact the viability of our suppliers and contract manufacturers any disruption in our supply chain could reduce our revenue and adversely impact our financial results such a disruption could occur as a result of any number of events including but not limited to increases in wages that drive up prices or labor stoppages the imposition of regulations quotas or embargoes on components a scarcity of or significant increase in the price of required electronic components for our products trade restrictions tariffs or duties fluctuations in currency exchange rates transportation failures affecting the supply chain and shipment of materials and finished goods third party interference in the integrity of the products sourced through the supply chain the unavailability of raw materials severe weather conditions natural disasters civil unrest military conflicts geopolitical developments war or terrorism and disruptions in utility and other services any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture assemble and test such components internally could significantly delay our ability to ship our products which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our reputation and brand as well as our results of operations 

we are dependent on the availability and unimpaired use of allocated bands within the radio frequency spectrum our products may be subject to harmful interference from new or modified spectrum uses 

our gnss technology is dependent on the use of satellite signals and on terrestrial communication bands international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union “itu” a specialized technical agency of the united nations these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference each country also has regulatory authority over how each band is used in the country in the united states the federal communications commission “fcc” and the national telecommunications and information administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations 

any itu or local reallocation of radio frequency bands including frequency band segmentation and sharing of spectrum or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant adverse impacts on our customers both of which could reduce demand for our products for example in 2020 the fcc approved a proposal by a private party to repurpose spectrum adjacent to the authorized gnss bands for terrestrial wireless operations throughout the united states the company has opposed and continues to oppose this proposal along with a wide range of participants in commercial and governmental sectors that rely on the use of gnss in their critical activities the fcc’s action is subject to further review as well as potential legislative action if the fcc’s action continues in effect and terrestrial operations are implemented in the affected spectrum these operations could create harmful interference to gnss receivers in proximity to such operations and impose costs to retrofit or replace affected receivers similarly other countries have considered proposals for use of frequencies used by our products as well as adjacent bands that could cause harmful interference to our products 

many of our products use other radio frequency bands such as the public land mobile radio bands together with the gnss signal to provide enhanced gnss capabilities such as realtime kinematics precision the continuing availability of these nongnss radio frequencies is essential to provide enhanced gnss products to our precision survey agriculture and construction machine controls markets in addition transmissions and emissions from other services and equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or inband may impair the utility and reliability of our products any regulatory changes in spectrum allocation or in allowable operating conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

many of our products rely on gnss technology gps and other satellite systems which may become degraded or inoperable and result in lost revenue 

gnss technology gps satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible intentional disruption many of the gps satellites currently in orbit were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of operational satellites in orbit some have been in operation for 15 years or more repair of damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites a reduction in the number of operating satellites below the 24satellite standard established for gps may impair the utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities in addition software updates to gps satellites and ground control segments and infrequent known events such as gps week number rollover may adversely affect our products and customers we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of system updates to mitigate these problems which may not be available or complete 

we are dependent on continued operation of gps the principal gnss currently in operation the gps constellation is operated by the u s government which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps if supporting policies were to change or if user fees were imposed it could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

many of our products also use signals from systems that augment gps such as the wide area augmentation system and national differential gps system and satellites transmitting signal corrections data on mobile satellite services frequencies utilized by our rtx corrections services some of these augmentation systems are operated by the us government and rely on continued funding and maintenance of these systems any curtailment of the operating capability of these systems or limitations on access to or use of the signals or discontinuance of service could result in degradation of our services or product performance with an adverse effect on our business 

many of our products use satellite signals from the russian glonass and the european galileo gnss systems other countries including china and india are in the process of creating their own gnss systems and we either have developed or will develop products that use gnss signals from these systems national or european authorities may provide preferential access to signals to companies associated with their markets including our competitors which could harm our competitive position use of nonus gnss signals are also subject to fcc waiver requirements and to restrictions based upon international trade or geopolitical considerations if we are unable to develop timely and competitive commercial products using these systems or obtain timely and equal access to service signals this could result in lost revenue these authorities may also adopt protectionist measures favoring national companies who make use of their gnss systems to the detriment of our products using the us gps system which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

regulatory risks 

we face risks inherent in conducting business internationally including compliance with international and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations 

these laws and regulations include data privacy requirements labor relations laws tax laws anticompetition regulations import and trade restrictions export control laws and laws that prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers including the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act and other anticorruption laws that have recently been the subject of a substantial increase in global enforcement many of our products are subject to us export law restrictions that limit the destinations and types of customers to which our products may be sold or that require an export license in connection with sales outside the united states given the high level of complexity of these laws there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently or intentionally breached for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise also we may be held liable for actions taken by our local dealers and partners violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees and prohibitions or conditions on the conduct of our business any such violations could include prohibitions or conditions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our operating results 

we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced significant governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices we may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence or through other methods that relevant law and regulations prohibit us from using our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties 

table of contents 

we are subject to evolving privacy laws in the united states and other jurisdictions that are subject to potentially differing interpretations and which could adversely impact our business and require that we incur substantial costs 

existing privacyrelated laws and regulations in the united states and other countries are evolving and are subject to potentially differing interpretations and various us federal and state or other international legislative and regulatory bodies may expand or enact laws regarding privacy and data securityrelated matters for example the euus privacy shield a basis for data transfers from the eu to the us was invalidated by the european court of justice and we expect that the international transfer of personal data will present ongoing compliance challenges and complicate our business transactions and operations brexit the united kingdoms withdrawal from the european union could also lead to further legislative and regulatory changes with regard to personal data transfers between the two territories new privacy laws have come into effect in brazil and new zealand in 2020 and revisions of privacy laws are currently pending in countries like canada and china some countries are considering or have passed legislation that requires local storage and processing of data including geospatial data in addition in june 2018 california enacted the california consumer privacy act the “ccpa” which took effect in january 2020 and has been amended by the california privacy rights act “the “cpra” passed via ballot initiative in november 2020 and will fully take effect in january 2023 the ccpa and cpra among other things gives california residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used other states and the us congress have introduced data privacy legislation that may impact our business data privacy legislation amendments and revisions to existing data privacy legislation and other developments impacting data privacy and data protection may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies increase the complexity of providing our products and services and cause us to incur substantial costs in an effort to comply failure to comply may lead to significant fines and business interruption 

we are subject to the impact of governmental and other certifications processes and regulations which could adversely affect our products and our business 

we market many products that are subject to governmental regulations and certifications before they can be sold the european union increasingly regulates the use of our products on agriculture construction and other types of machinery as we develop and enhance features which support automated and autonomous operation of our products we are increasingly subject to functional safety regulation ce certification is required for gnss receivers and data communications products which must also conform to the european harmonized gnss receiver requirements and the radio equipment directive to be sold in the european community in the future us european or other governmental authorities may propose gps receiver testing and certification for compliance with published gps signal interface or other specifications governmental authorities may also propose other forms of gps receiver performance standards which may limit design alternatives hamper product innovation or impose additional costs some of our products that use integrated radio communication technology require product type certification and some products require an enduser to obtain licensing from the fcc and other national authorities for frequencyband usage compliance with evolving product regulations in our major markets could require that we redesign our products cease selling products in certain markets and increase our costs of product development an inability to obtain required certifications in a timely manner could adversely affect our ability to bring our products to market and harm our customer relationships failure to comply with evolving requirements could result in fines and limitations on sales of our products 

financial and tax risks 

our debt could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations 

at the end of fiscal 2020 our total debt was comprised primarily of senior notes of 13000 million and four uncommitted revolving credit facilities totaling 2558 million when our senior notes mature we will have to expend significant resources to repay these senior notes or seek to refinance them if we decide to refinance the senior notes we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the senior notes at all both of which may adversely affect our financial condition any downgrade by credit rating agencies could adversely affect our cost of borrowing limit our access to the capital markets or result in more restrictive covenants in future debt agreements 

our outstanding indebtedness could have other important consequences such as 

• requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations and other capital resources to debt service thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital capital expenditures general corporate purposes and other cash requirements particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

• reducing our ability to make investments and acquisitions which support the growth of the company or to repurchase shares of our common stock and 

table of contents 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes and opportunities in our industry which may place us at a competitive disadvantage 

there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and we may not be able to repay the indebtedness that becomes due a default under our debt instruments may also significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control a portion of our outstanding debt has interest rates which float based on prevailing interest rates and we may incur additional variablerate debt in the future such rates tend to fluctuate based on general economic conditions general interest rates federal reserve rates and the supply of and demand for credit in the relevant interbanking market if interest rates increase our interest expense will also increase as would the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness or obtaining new debt 

our ability to incur additional indebtedness over time may be limited due to applicable financial covenants and restrictions and due to the risk that significantly increasing our level of indebtedness could impact the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations which in turn would increase the interest rates and fees that we pay in connection with our indebtedness 

changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income in future periods 

as a global company we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities while we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business it is possible that these positions may be contested or overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities which may have a significant impact on our global provision for income taxes our effective tax rate is largely based on the geographic mix of earnings statutory rates intercompany transfer pricing and enacted tax laws a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates including 

• the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed 

• the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with us and foreign tax authorities 

• changes in our intercompany transfer pricing methodology 

• changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 

• increases in expense not deductible for tax purposes including transaction costs and impairments of goodwill in connection with acquisitions 

• changes in the realizability of available tax credits 

• changes in sharebased compensation 

• changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws including the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” and the base erosion and profit shifting “beps” project conducted by the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” and 

• changes in generally accepted accounting principles 

tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied and governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax act which made substantial changes to us tax law the ongoing implementation and interpretation of the tax act any additional forthcoming legislative or administrative guidance and accounting standards related to the tax act could adversely affect our future effective tax rates the implementation by us of new practices and processes designed to comply with and benefit from the tax act and its rules and regulations could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices allocate additional resources and increase our costs which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition in light of recent changes in us tax laws and to align with our international business operations in the fourth quarter of 2019 we completed a nonus intercompany transfer of our intellectual property to a subsidiary in the netherlands this transfer and other changes we make to practices and processes based upon changes in us and other tax laws are subject to challenge and an adverse outcome in any such challenge could adversely affect our reported financial results 

additionally longstanding international tax norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax crossborder international trade are evolving as a result of the beps reporting requirements recommended by the g8 g20 and the oecd the foreign countries where we do business may change tax laws regulations and interpretations on a prospective or retroactive basis and these potential changes could adversely affect our effective tax rates as these and other tax laws and related regulations change our financial results could be materially impacted given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their

potential interdependency it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow but such changes could adversely impact our financial results 

we are currently in various stages of multiple year examinations by state and foreign taxing authorities if taxing authorities of any jurisdiction were to successfully challenge a material tax position we could become subject to higher taxes and our earnings could be adversely affected 

we may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates although the majority of our sales are transacted in us dollars expenses may be paid in local currencies an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the us where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses procurement of raw materials from sources outside the united states and overseas capital expenditures we also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies our foreign exchange forward contracts reduce but do not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements therefore changes in exchange rates could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to ownership of our stock 

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect an investment in our common stock 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile during fiscal 2020 our stock price ranged from 2132 to 6677 we believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate perhaps substantially including 

• general conditions in the worldwide economy 

• quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results and order levels 

announcements and reports of developments related to our business our major customers and partners and the industries in which we compete or the industries in which our customers compete 

• security breaches 

• acquisition announcements 

• new products or product enhancements announced or introduced by us or our competitors 

• disputes with respect to developments in patents or other intellectual property rights 

• developments in our relationships with our partners customers and suppliers 

• the imposition of tariffs or other trade barriers 

• political economic or social uncertainty 

• global pandemics like the covid19 pandemic and 

• acts of terrorism 

in addition the stock market in general and the markets for shares of “hightech” companies in particular have frequently experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate which could adversely impact our operations financial results and stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control results in any period could be affected by 

• changes in market demand 

• competitive market conditions 

• the timing of recognizing revenue 

• fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

• the cost and availability of components 

• the mix of our customer base and sales channels 

• the mix of products sold 

• pricing of products 

• changes in us or foreign policies on taxes trade or spending including the tax act 

• regional responses and restrictions related to global pandemics like the covid19 pandemic and 

• other risks including those described below 

table of contents 

seasonal variations in demand for our products may also affect our quarterly results construction equipment revenue has historically been the highest in early spring our agricultural equipment revenue has historically been the highest in the first quarter followed by the second quarter reflecting buying in anticipation of the spring planting season in the northern hemisphere if we do not accurately forecast seasonal demand we may be left with unsold inventory or have a shortage of inventory which could adversely impact our results of operations 

due in part to the buying patterns of our customers a portion of our hardware revenue occurs from orders received and immediately shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of each quarter while our operating expense tends to remain fairly predictable these patterns could harm our operating results if for any reason expected sales are deferred orders are not received or shipments are delayed a few days at the end of a quarter 

the price of our common stock could decline substantially in the event any of these risks result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors which are based on historical and predictive models that are not necessarily accurate representations of the future 

general risk factors 

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes 

we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes can be difficult to predict management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability or may suffer unforeseen liabilities which could then impact the results of a financial period a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable which if not expected could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions could disrupt our operations 

acts of war acts of terrorism or civil unrest natural disasters and other catastrophic events especially any events that impact our larger markets or gnss signals or systems could have a material adverse impact on our business the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military activity in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism or hostilities may involve a redeployment of the satellites used in gnss or interruptions of the system civil unrest local conflicts or other political instability may adversely impact regional economies cause work stoppages or result in limitations on business transactions with the affected jurisdictions to the extent that such interruptions result in delays or the cancellation of orders disruption of the manufacturing or shipment of our products or reduced demand for our products these interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

future public health crises and epidemics could impact our international operations and sales 

our results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent that future pandemics similar to covid19 or any other epidemic harm any significant market where we do business contagious disease epidemics or global pandemics could also significantly impact our international supply chain and result in component and product shortages and general disruptions to the economy such outbreaks could also result in mass quarantines business closures and significantly impact our suppliers customers and commercial partners in affected areas which may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

covid19 update 

in early march 2020 the world health organization characterized covid19 as a pandemic as the covid19 pandemic unfolded globally we implemented protocols to safeguard our employees customers suppliers thirdparty business partners and communities and ensure business continuity 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts our business operations in future periods will depend on multiple uncertain factors outside of our control such as its continued and future overall impact on the global economy and in the industries where we operate we experienced an overall revenue decline in fiscal 2020 due to economic disruptions related to covid19 that began in the last weeks of march primarily in hardware and professional services for the first two quarters overall revenue increased in the third and fourth quarters despite the revenue shortfall operating income increased due to improved mix of higher margin sales and reduced spending due to cost containment measures as well as natural reductions in spending resulting from covid19 restrictions 

as the covid19 pandemic is continually evolving we are uncertain of its ultimate duration and the nature and extent of its impact on our business financial condition and results of operations to the extent that regions where we do business or source our products experience additional closures or restrictions on business activity our results of operations could be harmed 

see “1a risk factors” for further discussion of the possible impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs of sales operating expenses and related disclosures we consider the accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting policies these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies our accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 of our accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this annual report on form 10k 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services revenue is recognized net of allowance for returns and any taxes collected from customers we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations however determining whether products or services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may sometimes require significant judgment 

judgment is required to determine standalone selling price “ssp” for each distinct performance obligation we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when products and services are sold separately and determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services in instances where ssp is not directly observable we determine ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs 

income taxes 

we are a us based multinational company operating in multiple us and foreign jurisdictions judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual tax audit outcomes determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment changes in recognition or measurement of our uncertain tax positions would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

income taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred tax assets or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if we believe it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized 

we are subject to the periodic examination of our domestic and foreign tax returns by the irs state local and foreign tax authorities who may challenge our tax positions we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 

business combinations and valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree based on their fair values at the acquisition date the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill 

when determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to expected future cash flows which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins customer attrition rates future changes in technology and brand awareness loyalty and position and discount rates identifiable intangible assets are comprised of distribution channels and distribution rights patents licenses technology acquired backlog trademarks and inprocess research and development 

we evaluate goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist we utilize either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative test to assess the likelihood of an impairment in performing the qualitative assessment we consider macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors that may impact the reporting units when we perform a quantitative test the estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of certain estimates and assumptions including expected future operating performance using riskadjusted discount rates 

table of contents 

we amortize identifiable intangible assets over their estimated useful lives on a straightline basis changes in circumstances such as technological advances changes to business models or changes in the capital strategy could result in a revised useful life if the useful life of an asset is revised the net book value of the estimated residual value is amortized over its revised remaining useful life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable based on their future cash flows the estimated future cash flows are primarily based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance

table of contents 

fiscal year 2020 compared with fiscal year 2019 

revenue 

in fiscal 2020 total revenue decreased by 1166 million or 4 overall revenue decreased due to weakness in transportation and to a lesser extent buildings and infrastructure and geospatial which were impacted in the first two quarters by covid19 the decrease was partially offset by organic and acquisitions growth in resources and utilities as well as recovery in buildings and infrastructure and geospatial in the third and fourth quarters we consider acquisition growth to include acquisition revenue that was not applicable in the prior corresponding periods 

by revenue category overall product revenue decreased 1068 million or 6 service revenue decreased 414 million or 6 and subscription revenue increased 316 million or 5 product revenue decreased primarily due to weakness in our hardware sales in transportation and to a lesser extent buildings and infrastructure partially offset by growth in resources and utilities geospatial was relatively flat the decrease in geospatial hardware sales in the first two quarters was largely offset by increased hardware sales in the third and fourth quarters service revenue decreased due to lower professional services associated with customer installations subscription revenue increased primarily due to strong organic growth in buildings and infrastructure and to a lesser extent acquisition revenue from resources and utilities partially offset by weakness in transportation 

during fiscal 2020 sales to customers in north america represented 52 europe represented 29 asia pacific represented 13 and the rest of world represented 6 of our total revenue 

no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenue in fiscal 2020 and 2019 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our accounts receivable at the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019 

gross margin 

gross margin varies due to several factors including product mix pricing distribution channel production volumes new product startup costs and foreign currency translations 

in fiscal 2020 gross margin decreased by 260 million or 1 primarily due to revenue declines as noted above partially offset by improved product mix gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 558 in fiscal 2020 compared to 546 in fiscal 2019 this growth in gross margin percentage was driven by improved revenue mix including increased higher margin software and subscription sales in buildings and infrastructure and resources and utilities as well as new product introductions and less discounting in geospatial partially offset by product mix and pricing pressures in transportation 

operating income 

in fiscal 2020 operating income increased by 439 million or 12 operating income as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2020 was 133 compared to 115 in fiscal 2019 despite the revenue shortfall operating income and operating income as a percentage of total revenue increased due to strong results in buildings and infrastructure geospatial and resources and utilities including improved mix of higher margin sales as well as operating expense reductions across all segments partially offset by weaker sales and gross margin compression in transportation

the following table shows research and development “rd” sales and marketing “sm” and general and administrative “ga” expense along with these expenses as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated 



fiscal year 2020 compared with fiscal year 2019 

in fiscal 2020 overall rd sm and ga expenses decreased by 607 million or 5 

rd expense increased by 62 million or 1 the increase in rd expense was primarily due to higher compensation expense including incentive compensation and increased rd expenses from acquired businesses not included in the prior corresponding period partially offset by lower consulting and outside services and travel reductions 

we believe that the development and introduction of new products are critical to our future success and we expect to continue active development of new products 

sm expense decreased by 372 million or 7 the decrease in sm expenses was primarily due to travel reductions lower advertising costs and lower compensation expense partially offset by higher sm expenses from acquired businesses not included in the prior corresponding p eriod 

ga expense decreased by 297 million or 9 the decrease in ga expense was primarily due to lower compensation expense lower tax and legal costs and travel reductions partially offset by increased ga expenses from acquired businesses not included in the prior corresponding period

table of contents 

in fiscal 2020 total nonoperating expense net decreased by 63 million or 20 primarily due to lower interest costs and increased joint venture profitability partially offset by unfavorable impacts fro m foreign currency exchange incl uded in other income net 

income tax provision 

the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act enacted on march 27 2020 provides tax relief to individuals and businesses in light of the impacts of covid19 it did not result in material adjustments to our income tax provision or to our net deferred tax assets as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 

in december 2020 due to a change in the netherlands tax law the statutory tax rate was increased from 217 to 250 effective january 1 2021 as a result we recorded a onetime tax benefit of 640 million due to the revaluation of the netherlands deferred tax assets 

in december 2019 to align with our international business operations we completed a nonus intercompany transfer of our intellectual property to a subsidiary in the netherlands the transaction resulted in deferred tax assets in the netherlands and global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” deferred tax liabilities in the us recorded at the applicable statutory tax rates resulting in a onetime income tax benefit of approximately 2063 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 

our effective income tax rates for fiscal 2020 and 2019 were 11 and 492 respectively the effective income tax rates in fiscal 2020 increased compared to 2019 primarily due to the onetime tax benefit from the nonus intercompany transfer of intellectual property in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019

fiscal year 2020 compared with fiscal year 2019 

buildings and infrastructure 

buildings and infrastructure revenue decreased by 272 million or 2 and segment operating income increased by 182 million or 6 revenue decreased primarily due to a decline in civil engineering and construction hardware sales in the first two quarters of fiscal 2020 and lower revenue from professional services due to the economic impacts of covid19 partially offset by higher software maintenance and subscription revenue hardware sales recovered in the third and fourth quarters due to improved market conditions including pent up demand and government stimulus programs segment operating income and 

table of contents 

operating income as a percentage of segment revenue increased due to gross margin improvements from higher mix of software maintenance and subscription revenue as well as cost reductions 

geospatial 

geospatial revenue increased by 11 million or less than 1 and segment operating income increased by 522 million or 39 revenue was relatively flat for the year while survey sales recovered in the third and fourth quarters due to improved market conditions including pent up demand government stimulus programs and new product introductions there was a decline in the first two quarters due to the economic impacts of covid19 segment operating income and operating income as a percentage of segment revenue increased primarily due to gross margin improvements resulting from new higher margin product introductions and less discounting as well as cost reductions 

resources and utilities 

resources and utilities revenue increased by 586 million or 10 and segment operating income increased by 519 million or 31 revenue increased due to strength in agriculture reseller and oem channels resulting from improved market conditions including stabilization of commodity prices government stimulus programs and weather conditions acquisition revenue primarily cityworks also contributed to growth segment operating income and operating income as a percentage of segment revenue increased due to revenue expansion and gross margin improvements resulting from higher margin software maintenance and subscription sales as well as cost reductions 

transportation 

transportation revenue decreased by 1518 million or 19 and segment operating income decreased by 758 million or 60 revenue decreased primarily due to reduced hardware upgrades and subscriber declines attributable in part to challenges with the electronic logging device transition in the trucking industry as well as the economic impacts of covid19 conversion of customers from perpetual software to subscription products also reduced revenue segment operating income and operating income as a percentage of segment revenue decreased primarily due to the revenue declines discrete inventory charges and higher operating expense due to the kuebix acquisition partially offset by cost reductions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than inventory purchases and other commitments incurred in the normal course of business see contractual obligations table below we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities 

in the normal course of business to facilitate sales of our products we indemnify other parties including customers lessors and parties to other transactions with us with respect to certain matters we may agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties these agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim in connection with divesting some of our businesses or assets we may also indemnify purchasers for certain matters in the normal course of business such as breaches of representations covenants or excluded liabilities in addition we entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents 

it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under these agreements were not material and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on the consolidated balance sheets at the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019

liquidity and capital resources 

  



cash and cash equivalents 

our ability to continue to generate cash from operations will depend in large part on profitability the rate of collections of accounts receivable our inventory turns and our ability to manage other areas of working capital our cash and cash equivalents are maintained with several financial institutions deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions considered to be of reputable credit and to present little credit risk we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and borrowings as described below under the heading “debt” along with cash provided by operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs debt service stock repurchases under our 2017 stock repurchase program and planned capital expenditures 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 6720 million for fiscal 2020 compared to 5850 million for fiscal 2019 the increase of 870 million was primarily driven by an increase in net income net of noncash items and favorable working capital changes including positive accounts receivable impact due to improved sales linearity and higher accrued compensation partially offset by deferred revenue and accrued liabilities changes 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 2318 million for fiscal 2020 compared to 2753 million for fiscal 2019 the decrease of 435 million was primarily due to decreased spending for business acquisitions and to a lessor extent reduced spending on property and equipment the current year included kuebix acquisition compared to the prior year which included the cityworks acquisition 

financing activities 

cash used in financing activities was 4003 million for fiscal 2020 compared to 2926 million during fiscal 2019 the increase of 1077 million was primarily driven by the increase in debt repayments net of proceeds partially offset by a decrease in the repurchase of common stock 

debt 

during fiscal 2020 we repaid 3122 million of debt including the full repayment of our term loan net of borrowings each of our debt agreements requires us to maintain compliance with certain debt covenants all of which we were in compliance with at the end of fiscal 2020 refer to note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt

5 income taxes payable represents a onetime transition tax liability related to known amounts of cash taxes payable in future years as a result of the tax act 

excluded from the table above are unrecognized tax benefits of 554 million included in other noncurrent liabilities including interest and penalties at this time we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with tax authorities regarding this liability and therefore such amounts are not included in the contractual obligations table above refer to note 12 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our taxes

arr represents the estimated annualized value of recurring revenue including subscription maintenance and software revenue and term license contracts for the quarter arr is calculated by adding the portion of the contract value of all of our term licenses attributable to the current quarter to our nongaap recurring revenue for the current quarter and dividing that sum by the number of days in the quarter and then multiplying that quotient by 365 arr should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as it is a performance measure and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items 

nongaap explanations 

nongaap revenue 

we believe this measure helps investors understand the performance of our business as nongaap revenue excludes the effects of certain acquired deferred revenue that was written down to fair value in purchase accounting management believes that excluding fair value purchase accounting adjustments more closely correlates with the ordinary and ongoing course of the acquired company’s operations and facilitates analysis of revenue growth and trends 

nongaap gross margin 

we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap gross margin as a way of understanding how product mix pricing decisions and manufacturing costs influence our business nongaap gross margin excludes the effects of certain acquired deferred revenue amortization of purchased intangible assets amortization of acquisition related inventory stepup acquisitiondivestiture items stockbased compensation deferred compensation restructuring charges and covid19 expenses we believe that these adjustments offer investors additional information that may be useful to view trends in our gross margin performance 

nongaap operating expenses 

we believe this measure is important to investors evaluating our nongaap spending in relation to revenue nongaap operating expenses exclude the effects of certain acquired capitalized commissions that were eliminated in purchase accounting amortization of purchased intangible assets acquisitiondivestiture items stockbased compensation deferred compensation restructuring charges executive transition costs and covid19 expenses we believe that these adjustments offer investors supplemental information to facilitate comparison of our operating expenses to our prior results and trends 

nongaap operating income 

we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap operating income trends which are driven by revenue gross margin and spending nongaap operating income excludes the effects of purchase accounting adjustments to certain acquired deferred revenue and acquired capitalized commissions amortization of purchased intangible assets amortization of acquisition related inventory stepup acquisitiondivestiture items stockbased compensation deferred compensation restructuring charges executive transition costs and covid19 expenses we believe that these adjustments offer a supplemental means for our investors to evaluate current operating performance compared to prior results and trends 

nongaap nonoperating expense net 

we believe this measure helps investors evaluate our nonoperating income trends nongaap nonoperating expense net excludes acquisitiondivestiture items deferred compensation and debt issuance costs we believe that these exclusions provide investors with a supplemental view of our ongoing financial results 

nongaap income tax provision 

we believe this measure helps investors because it provides for consistent treatment of excluded items in our nongaap presentation and a difference in the gaap and nongaap tax rates the nongaap tax rate excludes charges and benefits such as net deferred tax impacts results from the nonus intercompany transfer of intellectual property tax law changes net deferred tax impacts resulting from the us 2017 tax act and significant onetime reserve releases upon statute of limitations expirations we believe our nongaap tax rate facilitates a comparison of our periodtoperiod results excluding the above items which can introduce volatility to our tax rate

nongaap net income 

this measure provides a supplemental view of net income trends which are driven by nongaap income before taxes and our nongaap tax rate nongaap net income excludes the effects of purchase accounting adjustments to certain acquired deferred revenue and acquired capitalized commissions amortization of purchased intangible assets amortization of acquisition related inventory stepup acquisitiondivestiture items stockbased compensation restructuring charges executive transition costs covid19 expenses debt issuance costs and nongaap tax adjustments we believe our investors benefit from understanding these adjustments and from an alternative view of our net income performance as compared to prior periods and trends 

nongaap diluted net income per share 

we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap operating performance as reflected in a per share calculation as a way of measuring nongaap operating performance by ownership in the company nongaap diluted net income per share excludes the effects of purchase accounting adjustments to certain acquired deferred revenue and acquired capitalized commissions amortization of purchased intangible assets amortization of acquisition related inventory stepup acquisitiondivestiture items stockbased compensation restructuring charges executive transition costs covid19 expenses debt issuance costs and nongaap tax adjustments we believe that these adjustments offer investors a useful view of our diluted net income per share as compared to prior periods and trends 

adjusted ebitda 

adjusted ebitda is a performance measure that we believe offers a useful view of the overall operations of our business we believe it is useful because it facilitates companytocompany operating performance comparisons by removing potential differences caused by variations unrelated to operating performance such as capital structures interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization expenses we define adjusted ebitda as nongaap operating income plus depreciation expense and income from equity method investments net other companies define adjusted ebitda differently and so our measure may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures our investors should consider the limitations of using adjusted ebitda including the fact that this measure does not provide a complete measure of our operating performance adjusted ebitda is not intended to purport to be an alternative to net income or operating income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity in particular adjusted ebitda is not intended to be a measure of cash flow available for our discretionary expenditures as this measure does not consider certain cash requirements such as restructuring charges executive transition costs acquisition and divestiture items interest payments tax payments and other debt service requirements 

these nongaap measures can be used to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance as well as our performance relative to competitors we believe some of our investors track our core operating performance as a means of evaluating our performance in the ordinary ongoing and customary course of our operations core operating performance excludes items that are noncash not expected to recur or not reflective of ongoing financial results management also believes that looking at our core operating performance provides a supplemental way to provide consistency in periodtoperiod comparisons accordingly management excludes from nongaap the effects of purchase accounting adjustments to certain acquired deferred revenue and acquired capitalized commissions amortization of purchased intangible assets amortization of acquisition related inventory stepup acquisitiondivestiture items stockbased compensation deferred compensation restructuring charges executive transition costs covid19 expenses debt issuance costs and nongaap tax adjustments 

a acquired deferred revenue adjustment  purchase accounting generally requires us to writedown acquired deferred revenue to fair value our gaap revenue includes the fair value impact from purchase accounting for postcontract support and subscriptions contracts assumed in connection with our acquisitions the nongaap adjustment to our revenue is intended to reflect the full amount of such revenue we believe this adjustment is useful to investors as a measure of the ongoing performance of our business and facilitates analysis of revenue growth and business trends 

b amortization of acquired capitalized commissions  purchase accounting generally requires us to eliminate capitalized sales commissions balances as of the acquisition date our gaap sales and marketing expenses generally do not reflect the amortization of these capitalized sales commissions balances the nongaap adjustment to increase our sales and marketing expenses is intended to reflect the full amount of amortization related to such balances as though the acquired companies operated independently in the periods presented we believe this adjustment to sales and marketing expenses is useful to investors as a measure of the ongoing performance of our business 

c amortization of purchased intangible assets  included in our gaap presentation of cost of sales and operating expenses is amortization of purchased intangible assets we believe that by excluding the amortization of purchased intangible assets which primarily represents technology andor customer relationships already developed this provides an 

table of contents 

alternative way for investors to compare our operations preacquisition to those postacquisition and to those of our competitors that have pursued internal growth strategies however we note that companies that grow internally will incur costs to develop intangible assets that will be expensed in the period incurred which may make a direct comparison more difficult 

d amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup the purchase accounting entries associated with our business acquisitions require us to record inventory at its fair value which is sometimes greater than the previous book value of the inventory included in our gaap presentation the increase in inventory value is amortized to cost of sales over the period that the related product is sold we exclude inventory stepup amortization from our nongaap measures because it is a noncash expense that we do not believe is indicative of our ongoing operating results 

e acquisition  divestiture items  included in our gaap presentation of cost of sales and operating expenses acquisition costs consist of external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition and strategic investment activities such as legal due diligence integration and other closing costs including the acceleration of acquisition stock options and adjustments to the fair value of earnout liabilities included in our gaap presentation of nonoperating expense net acquisitiondivestiture items includes unusual acquisition investment andor divestiture gainslosses although we do numerous acquisitions the costs that have been excluded from the nongaap measures are costs specific to particular acquisitions these are onetime costs that vary significantly in amount and timing and are not indicative of our core operating performance 

f stockbased compensation  deferred compensation  included in our gaap presentation of cost of sales and operating expenses are stockbased compensation consists of expenses for employee stock options and awards and purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan additionally included in our gaap presentation of cost of sales and operating expenses are income or expense associated with movement in our nonqualified deferred compensation plan liabilities changes in nonqualified deferred compensation plan assets included in nonoperating expense net offset the income or expense in the plan liabilities we exclude them from our nongaap measures because some investors may view it as not reflective of our core operating performance as they are a noncash item 

g restructuring charges  executive transition costs included in our gaap presentation of cost of sales and operating expenses restructuring charges recorded are primarily for employee compensation resulting from reductions in employee headcount in connection with our company restructurings and lease and building costs additionally included in our gaap presentation of operating expenses are amounts paid to former company executives under the terms of the executive severance agreements we exclude restructuring charges and executive transition costs from our nongaap measures because we believe they do not reflect expected future operating expenses they are not indicative of our core operating performance and they are not meaningful in comparisons to our past operating performance we have incurred restructuring expenses in each of the periods presented however the amount incurred can vary significantly based on whether a restructuring has occurred in the period and the timing of headcount reductions further we believe that excluding executive transition costs from our nongaap results is useful to investors because it allows for periodoverperiod comparability 

h covid19 expenses included in our gaap presentation of cost of sales and operating expenses covid19 expenses consist of costs incurred as a direct impact from the covid19 virus pandemic such as cancellation fees of trade shows due to public safety issues additional costs for disinfecting facilities and personal protective equipment we exclude covid19 expenses from our nongaap measures because we believe they are onetime costs that vary significantly in amount and timing and are not indicative of our core operating performance 

i debt issuance costs included in our nonoperating expense net this amount represents incurred costs in connection with a bridge facility we put in place for the viewpoint acquisition costs associated with the issuance of new credit facilities and our senior notes issued in 2018 that were not capitalized as debt issuance costs and a writeoff of debt issuance costs for terminated andor modified credit facilities we excluded the debt issuance cost writeoff from our nongaap measures we believe that investors benefit from excluding this item from our nonoperating income to facilitate an evaluation of our nonoperating income trends 

j nongaap items tax effected  this amount adjusts the provision for income taxes to reflect the effect of the nongaap items a  i on nongaap net income this amount excludes the gaap tax rate impact resulting from the tax reform impacts and nonus intercompany transfer of intellectual property which is separately disclosed in items l and m we believe this information is useful to investors because it provides for consistent treatment of the excluded items in this nongaap presentation 

table of contents 

k difference in gaap and nongaap tax rate  this amount represents the difference between the gaap and nongaap tax rates applied to the nongaap operating income plus the nongaap nonoperating expense net the gaap tax rate used for this calculation excludes the net deferred tax impacts resulting from the tax reform impacts and nonus intercompany transfer of intellectual property which is separately disclosed in items l and m t he nongaap tax rate excludes charges and benefits such as net deferred tax impacts results from the nonus intercompany transfer of intellectual property net deferred tax impacts resulting from the us 2017 tax act and significant onetime reserve releases upon statute of limitations expirations we believe that investors benefit from excluding this amount from our nongaap income tax provision because it facilitates a comparison of the nongaap tax provision in the current and prior periods 

l tax reform impacts the provision primarily includes a onetime tax benefit from the policy election to establish deferred taxes in relation to gilti as created by the tax act we excluded this item as it is a nonrecurring expense we believe that investors benefit from excluding this item from our nongaap income tax provision because it allows for periodoverperiod comparability 

m ip restructuring and tax law change impacts these amounts represent net deferred tax impacts resulting from a nonus intercompany transfer of intellectual property consistent with tax law changes including tax rates changes and our international business operations we excluded this because it is not indicative of our core operating performance 

n gaap and nongaap tax rate percentages  these percentages are defined as gaap income tax provision as a percentage of gaap income before taxes and nongaap income tax provision as a percentage of nongaap income before taxes we believe that investors benefit from a presentation of nongaap tax rate percentage as a way of facilitating a comparison to nongaap tax rates in prior periods

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors 

market interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents consisted primarily of interest and noninterest bearing bank deposits as well as bank time deposits the main objective of these instruments is safety of principal and liquidity while maximizing return without significantly increasing risk 

due to the nature of our cash equivalents that they are readily convertible to cash we do not anticipate any material effect on our portfolio due to fluctuations in interest rates 

we are exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing interest rates under our credit facilities our 2018 credit facility includes a fiveyear revolving loan facility with a maturity date of may 2023 we also have four unsecured uncommitted revolving credit facilities that are callable by the bank at any time we may borrow funds under the 2018 credit facility in us dollars euros or in certain other agreed currencies as described in note 6 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

at the end of fiscal 2020 we had one £550 million two 750 million and one €1000 million revolving credit facilities which are uncommitted a hypothetical 1 increase in our borrowing rates at the end of fiscal 2020 could result in approximately 26 million annual increase in interest expense on these existing principal balances 

the hypothetical changes and assumptions made above will be different from what actually occurs in the future furthermore the computations do not anticipate actions that may be taken by our management should the hypothetical market changes actually occur over time as a result actual earnings effects in the future will differ from those quantified above 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we operate in international markets which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and various foreign currencies the most significant of which is the euro in addition volatile market conditions arising from the covid19 pandemic could result in changes in exchange rates 

historically the majority of our revenue contracts are denominated in us dollars with the most significant exception being europe where we invoice primarily in euro additionally a portion of our expenses primarily the cost to manufacture cost of personnel to deliver technical support on our products and professional services sales and sales support and research and development are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the euro 

revenue resulting from selling in local currencies and costs incurred in local currencies are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which can affect our operating income as exchange rates vary operating income may differ from expectations in fiscal 2020 revenue and operating income were favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates by 32 million and 43 million respectively 

table of contents 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash debt and certain trade and intercompany receivables and payables primarily denominated in new zealand dollars brazilian real canadian dollars norwegian krone and euro these contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rate movements as the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses on the forward contracts these instruments are markedtomarket through earnings every period and generally range from one to two months in maturity we do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes we occasionally enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase price of some of our larger business acquisitions foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019 are summarized as follows

patents licenses and intellectual property 

we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate we hold over 1200 unique issued and enforceable patents the majority of which cover gnss based technologies and other applications such as optical and laser technology we generally prefer to own the intellectual property used in our products either directly or through subsidiaries from time to time we license technology from third parties we are not dependent on any one patent and license we also own numerous trademarks and service marks that contribute to the identity and recognition of trimble and its global products and services 

competition 

our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future within our markets we encounter direct competition from other gnss software optical and laser suppliers such as hexagon and topcon and competition may intensify from various larger us and nonus competitors our hardware products are increasingly subject to competition from existing and new entrants from emerging markets such as china which compete aggressively on price at the lowerpriced end of the market as well as on economic nationalism our integrated hardware and software products may also be subject to increasing competition from mass market devices such as smartphones and tablets combined with relatively inexpensive applications which have not been heavily used for commercial applications in the past our software solutions are also increasingly subject to competition from existing and new entrants into the marketplace including from some companies that may have access to significantly more resources than trimble 

many of our products and solutions are focused on specific industries in each of these industries we face competition from companies providing point solutions or more traditionally less technology intensive products and services these companies often have greater financial resources and more established and recognized brands in those industries competing in vertical markets with more established industry participants requires that we successfully establish a market position and that we market new and sometimes unfamiliar technology and automated solutions to customers that have not previously used such products we also increasingly offer enterprise level solutions designed to meet the specific needs of our target industries in doing so we face competition from larger and more wellestablished providers of enterprise software and services with whom we have not previously competed see also risk factors  we face substantial competition in our markets which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition 

sales and marketing 

we tailor our gotomarket strategies to the needs of our products and regional markets around the world in addition to direct sales many of our products are sold worldwide primarily through indirect channels including distributors dealers and authorized representatives occasionally we grant exclusive rights to market certain products or within specific countries these channels are supported by our regional sales offices throughout the world we also utilize distribution alliances oem relationships and joint ventures with other companies as a means to serve selected markets as well as direct sales to endusers 

seasonality of business 

construction equipment revenue within our buildings and infrastructure segment historically have been higher in early spring our agricultural equipment revenue within our resources and utilities segment have historically been the highest in the first quarter followed by the second quarter reflecting buying in anticipation of the spring planting season in the northern hemisphere however overall as a company as a result of diversification of our business across segments and the increased impact of subscription revenue we may experience less seasonality in the future changes in global macroeconomic conditions could also impact the level of seasonality we experience 

manufacturing 

we outsource the manufacturing of many of our hardware products to our key contract manufacturing partners that include flex ltd benchmark electronics inc and jabil our contract manufacturing partners are responsible for significant material procurement assembly and testing we continue to manage product design through pilot production for the subcontracted products and we are directly involved in qualifying suppliers and key components used in all our products our current contract with flex ltd continues in effect until either party gives the other ninety days written notice we also utilize original design manufacturers for some of our products 

we manufacture our laser and opticsbased products as well as some of our gps products at our plants in dayton ohio danderyd sweden and shanghai china some of these products or portions of these products are also subcontracted to third parties for assembly 

our design manufacturing and distribution sites in dayton ohio sunnyvale california danderyd sweden eindhoven netherlands auckland new zealand​ and shanghai china are registered to iso900120​15 covering the design production distribution and servicing of all our products 

research and development 

we believe that our competitive position is maintained through the development and introduction of new products including software and services that incorporate improved features and functionality better performance smaller size and weight lower cost or some combination of these factors we invest substantially in the development of new products we also make significant investment in the positioning communication and information technologies that underlie our products and will likely provide competitive advantages

risk factors 

tableend 

risks and uncertainties 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k and in any other documents to which we refer you in this form 10k before purchasing our securities the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect an investment in our common stock 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile during fiscal 2019 our stock price ranged from 3093 to 4594 we believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate perhaps substantially including 

 announcements and reports of developments related to our business our major customers and partners and the industries in which we compete or the industries in which our customers compete 

 in addition the stock market in general and the markets for shares of “hightech” companies in particular have frequently experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we operate globally and are subject to significant risks in many jurisdictions 

global or regional conditions may harm our financial results we have operations in many countries and a significant portion of our revenue is derived from countries outside of the united states as a result our operations and our financial results including our ability to design develop or sell products may be adversely affected by a number of factors outside of our control including 

 

there is inherent risk that political diplomatic or military events could result in trade disruptions including tariffs trade embargoes export restrictions and other trade barriers a significant trade disruption or the establishment or increase of any trade barrier in any area where we do business including the asia pacific region could increase the cost of our products which could adversely impact the margin that we earn on sales make our products more expensive for customers or create uncertainty around demand for certain types of products which could make our products less competitive and reduce customer demand or otherwise have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits our and our customers’ businesses and our results of operations in 

response to us tariffs other countries may adopt tariffs and other trade barriers that could limit our ability to competitively offer our products and services recently the us government imposed tariffs on certain products imported into the us and the chinese government imposed tariffs on certain products imported into china tariffs may be increased in the future given the current us political climate and recent actions of the administration there is significant uncertainty about the trade policies treaties government regulations and tariffs that could apply to trade between the us and china as well as other nations in the future in addition if there is significant deterioration in the global economy the economies of the countries or regions where our customers are located or do business or the industries that we or our customers serve the demand for our products and services would likely decrease and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected in addition government or customer efforts attitudes laws or policies may lead to nonus customers favoring domestic suppliers that could compete with or replace our products which would also have an adverse effect on our business changes in economic conditions and political uncertainty surrounding international trade also make it difficult to make financial forecasts which could cause us to miss our financial guidance and adversely affect our stock price 

we face risks inherent in conducting business internationally including compliance with international and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations these laws and regulations include data privacy requirements labor relations laws tax laws anticompetition regulations import and trade restrictions export control laws and laws that prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers including the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the uk bribery act or other anticorruption laws that have recently been the subject of a substantial increase in global enforcement many of our products are subject to us export law restrictions that limit the destinations and types of customers to which our products may be sold or that require an export license in connection with sales outside the united states given the high level of complexity of these laws there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently or intentionally breached for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise also we may be held liable for actions taken by our local dealers and partners violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees and prohibitions or conditions on the conduct of our business any such violations could include prohibitions or conditions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our operating results 

we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced significant governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices we may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence or through other methods that relevant law and regulations prohibit us from using our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties 

existing privacyrelated laws and regulations in the united states and other countries are evolving and are subject to potentially differing interpretations and various us federal and state or other international legislative and regulatory bodies may expand or enact laws regarding privacy and data securityrelated matters for example the european union general data protection regulation became effective in may 2018 and is wideranging in scope in order to be compliant with the new eu requirements we must continue to invest resources necessary to implement and manage policy changes across our business units and services relating to how we collect and use personal data relating to customers employees and vendors failure to comply may lead to sizable fines in parallel with the advent of the euus privacy shield the new framework agreement between the us department of commerce and the european commission for transferring personal data from the european union to the united states and other national requirements we expect that the international transfer of personal data will present ongoing compliance challenges and complicate our business transactions countries outside the eu are considering or have passed legislation that requires local storage and processing of data which could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services 

we may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates although most of our sales occur in us dollars expenses may be paid in local currencies an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the us where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses as well as overseas capital expenditures we also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies our hedging programs reduce but do not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements therefore changes in exchange rates could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions could disrupt our operations acts of war acts of terrorism or civil unrest natural disasters and other catastrophic events especially any events that impact our larger markets or gnss signals or systems could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military activity in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism or hostilities may involve a redeployment of the satellites used in gnss or interruptions of the system civil unrest local conflicts or other political instability 

may adversely impact regional economies cause work stoppages or result in limitations on business transactions with the affected foreign jurisdictions to the extent that such interruptions result in delays or the cancellation of orders disruption of the manufacturing or shipment of our products or reduced demand for our products these interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

public health crises and epidemics such as the novel coronavirus outbreak that is significantly affecting china could impact our international operations and sales our results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent that the novel coronavirus or any other epidemic harms the chinese economy or other significant markets where we do business contagious disease epidemics or global pandemics could significantly impact our international supply chain and result in component and product shortages and general disruptions to the economy such outbreaks could also result in mass quarantines business closures and significantly impact our suppliers customers and commercial partners in affected areas which may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

engaging in international business inherently involves a number of other difficulties and risks 

these risks include 

 these factors or any combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue or our overall financial performance 

investing in and integrating new acquisitions could be costly place a significant strain on our management systems and resources or may fail to deliver the expected return on investment which could negatively impact our operating results 

we typically acquire a number of businesses each year and intend to continue to acquire other businesses acquisitions entail numerous risks including 

 

any such effects from acquisitions could be costly and place a significant strain on our management systems and resources 

as a result of acquisitions we have significant assets that include goodwill and other purchased intangibles the testing of goodwill and intangibles for impairment under established accounting guidelines requires significant use of judgment and assumptions changes in business conditions or in the prospects or results of operations of the acquired business could require negative adjustments to the valuation of these assets resulting in writeoffs that would adversely affect our results if we divest a business and the proceeds are less than the net book value at the time we would be forced to write off the difference in addition changes in the operating results or the valuation of companies in which we have investments may have a direct impact on our financial statements or could result in our having to write down the value of such investment 

even if successfully negotiated and closed acquisitions may not yield expected synergies may not advance our business strategy as expected may fall short of expected returnoninvestment targets or may not prove successful or effective for our business companies that we acquire may operate with different cost and margin structures which could further cause fluctuations in our operating results and adversely affect our operating margins 

our internal and customerfacing systems and systems of third parties we rely upon may be subject to cybersecurity breaches disruptions or delays 

a cybersecurity incident in our own systems or the systems of our thirdparty providers may compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of our own internal data the availability of our products and websites designed to support our customers or our customer data computer hackers foreign governments or cyber terrorists may attempt to or succeed in penetrating our network security and our website unauthorized access to our proprietary business information or customer data may be obtained through breakins sabotage breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks employee theft or misuse breach of the security of the networks of our third party providers or other misconduct additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data we have experienced security breaches in the past and despite our efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our systems it is impossible to eliminate this risk for example in late 2015 and early 2016 we were the subject of an attack by hackers operating in china this incident resulted in the theft of proprietary and confidential data related to our gps technology but has not had a meaningful impact on our business because the techniques used by computer hackers who may attempt to penetrate and sabotage our network security or our website change frequently they may take advantage of weaknesses in third party technology or standards of which we are unaware or that we do not control and may not be recognized until long after they have been launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate or counter these techniques it is also possible that unauthorized access to customer data or confidential information may be obtained through inadequate use of security controls by customers vendors or business partners efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop implement and maintain such efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems a cybersecurity incident affecting our systems may also result in theft of our intellectual property proprietary data or trade secrets which would compromise our competitive position reputation and operating results we also may be required to notify regulators about any actual or perceived personal data breach including the eu lead data protection authority as well as the individuals who are affected by the incident within strict time periods 

the systems we rely upon also remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from a number of other factors including access to the internet the failure of our network or software systems or significant variability in visitor traffic on our product websites earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunication failures computer viruses human error and similar events or disruptions some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities our systems are also subject to intentional acts of vandalism despite any precautions we may take the occurrence of a natural disaster a decision by any of our thirdparty hosting providers to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could cause system interruptions and delays and result in loss of critical data and lengthy interruptions in our services 

we rely on our information systems and those of third parties for activities such as processing customer orders delivery of products hosting and providing services and support to our customers billing and tracking our customers hosting and managing our customer data and otherwise running our business any disruptions or unexpected incompatibilities in our information systems and those of the third parties upon whom we rely could have a significant impact on our business 

an increasing portion of our revenue comes from saas solutions and other hosted services in which we store retrieve communicate and manage data which is critical to our customers’ business systems disruption of our systems that support these services and solutions could cause disruptions in our customers’ systems and in the businesses that rely on these systems any such disruptions could harm our reputation create liabilities to our customers hurt demand for our services and solutions and negatively impact our revenue and profitability 

we are subject to evolving privacy laws in the united states and other jurisdiction that are subject to potentially differing interpretations and which could adversely impact our business and require that we incur substantial costs and expenses 

existing privacyrelated laws and regulations in the united states and other countries are evolving and are subject to potentially differing interpretations and various us federal and state or other international legislative and regulatory bodies may expand or enact laws regarding privacy and data securityrelated matters for example the european union general data protection regulation “gdpr” became effective in may 2018 and is wideranging in scope in order to be compliant with the eu requirements we must continue to invest resources necessary to implement and manage policy changes across our business units 

and services relating to how we collect and use personal data relating to customers employees and vendors failure to comply may lead to sizable fines brexit could also lead to further legislative and regulatory changes with regard to personal data the united kingdom data protection act that substantially implements the gdpr became law in may 2018 it remains unclear however how united kingdom data protection laws or regulations will develop in the medium to longer term and how data transfers to and from the united kingdom will be regulated at the time that brexit is effectuated and implemented in parallel with the advent of the euus privacy shield the new framework agreement between the us department of commerce and the european commission for transferring personal data from the european union to the united states and other national requirements we expect that the international transfer of personal data will present ongoing compliance challenges and complicate our business transactions countries outside the eu are considering or have passed legislation that requires local storage and processing of data which could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services in addition in june 2018 california enacted the california consumer privacy act the “ccpa” which took effect in january 2020 the ccpa will among other things give california residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used the ccpa was amended in september 2018 and further modifications may be made to this law before it takes effect additionally in october 2019 the california department of justice published a notice of proposed rulemaking action with respect to draft regulations to implement the ccpa we cannot yet predict the impact of the ccpa on our business or operations but it may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply 

we may not be able to enter into or maintain important alliances and distribution relationships 

we believe that in certain business opportunities our success will depend on our ability to form and maintain alliances with industry participants such as caterpillar nikon hilti and cnh global our failure to form and maintain such alliances or the preemption or disruption of such alliances by actions of competitors could adversely affect our ability to sell our products to customers our relationships with substantial industry participants such as caterpillar and cnh are complex and multifaceted and are likely to evolve over time based upon the changing business needs and objectives of the parties since these strategic relationships contribute to significant ongoing business in certain of our important markets changes in these relationships could adversely affect our sales and revenue in addition we utilize dealer networks including those affiliated with some of our strategic allies such as caterpillar and cnh to market sell and service many of our products 

changes in our product mix including increasing provision of software and bundled solutions tailored to the needs of specific vertical markets impose new demands on our distribution channels and may require significant changes in the skills and expertise required to successfully distribute our products and services or the creation of new distribution channels recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in the use and the selling of our technology and product offerings requires significant time and resources in order to develop and expand our distribution channels we must continue to expand and improve our processes and procedures that support our distribution channels including our investment in systems and training and those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and difficult to manage the time and expense required for sales and marketing organizations of our channel partners to become familiar with our product offerings including our new product developments and newer types of offering such as software and services may make it more difficult to introduce those products to endusers and delay enduser adoption which could result in lower revenue 

disruption of dealer coverage within specific geographic or enduser markets could cause difficulties in marketing selling or servicing our products and have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition moreover dealers who carry products that compete with our products may focus their inventory purchases and sales efforts on goods provided by competitors due to industry demand or profitability such sourcing decisions can adversely impact our sales financial condition and results of operations 

our products are highly technical and may contain undetected errors product defects security vulnerabilities or software errors 

our products including our software products are highly technical and complex and when deployed may contain errors defects or security vulnerabilities we must develop our products quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing market and we have a history of frequently introducing new products products and services as sophisticated as ours could contain undetected errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new models or versions are released such occurrences could result in damage to our reputation lost revenue diverted development resources increased customer service and support costs warranty claims and litigation 

we warrant that our products will be free of defect for various periods of time depending on the product in addition certain of our contracts include epidemic failure clauses if invoked these clauses may entitle the customer to return or obtain credits for products and inventory or to cancel outstanding purchase orders even if the products themselves are not defective 

errors viruses or bugs may be present in software or hardware that we acquire or license from third parties and incorporate into our products or in third party software or hardware that our customers use in conjunction with our products our customers’ proprietary software and network firewall protections may corrupt data from our products and create difficulties in implementing our solutions changes to third party software or hardware that our customers use in conjunction with our software could also render our applications inoperable any errors defects or security vulnerabilities in our products or any defects in or compatibility issues with any third party hardware or software or customers’ network environments discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in revenue recognition loss of customers theft of trade secrets data or intellectual property and increased service and warranty cost any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products alone or in combination with third party hardware or software could expose them to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses and other malicious software programs that could attack our products actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could harm our reputation and lead some customers to return products to reduce or delay future purchases or use competitive products 

if we are unable to effectively manage our increasingly diverse and complex businesses and operations our ability to generate growth and revenue from new or existing customers may be adversely affected 

because our operations are geographically diverse and increasingly complex our personnel resources and infrastructure could become strained and our reputation in the market and our ability to successfully manage and grow our business may be adversely affected the size complexity and diverse nature of our business and the expansion of our product lines and customer base have placed increased demands on our management and operations and further growth if any may place additional strains on our resources in the future our ability to effectively compete and to manage our planned future growth will depend on among other things the following 

 the company has increasingly diversified the nature of its businesses both organically and by acquisition as a result an increasing amount of our business involves business models which require managerial techniques and skill sets which are different from those required to manage our historical core businesses 

over the last few years we have focused more on saas subscription models as a result we expect to derive an increasing portion of our revenue in the future from subscriptions this subscription model provides our customers the right to access certain of our software in a hosted environment or use downloaded software for a specified subscription period market acceptance of such offerings is affected by a variety of factors including but not limited to security reliability performance current license terms customer preference socialcommunity engagement customer concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage their data public concerns regarding privacy and the enactment of restrictive laws or regulations if we are unable to successfully support and host our saas offerings in light of the foregoing risks and uncertainties our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate which could negatively impact our operations financial results and stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control results in any period could be affected by 



 seasonal variations in demand for our products may also affect our quarterly results construction equipment revenue has historically been the highest in early spring our agricultural equipment revenue has historically been the highest in the first quarter followed by the second quarter reflecting buying in anticipation of the spring planting season in the northern hemisphere if we do not accurately forecast seasonal demand we may be left with unsold inventory or have a shortage of inventory which could negatively impact our financial results 

due in part to the buying patterns of our customers a significant portion of our quarterly revenue occurs from orders received and immediately shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of each quarter while our operating expense tends to remain fairly predictable these patterns could harm our operating results if for any reason expected sales are deferred orders are not received or shipments are delayed a few days at the end of a quarter 

the price of our common stock could decline substantially in the event any of these risks result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors which are based on historical and predictive models that are not necessarily accurate representations of the future 

changes in our software and subscription businesses may negatively affect our operations and financial results 

an increasing portion of our revenue is generated through software maintenance and subscription revenue which includes saas our customers have no obligation to renew their agreements for our software maintenance or subscription services after the expiration of their initial contract period which typically ranges from one to five years our customer acquisition and renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including overall economic conditions the health of their businesses competitive offerings and customer dissatisfaction with our services if customers do not renew their contracts for our products our maintenance and subscription revenue will decline and our financial results will suffer any reduction in the number of licenses that we sell even if our customer acquisition rates do not change will have a negative impact on our future maintenance revenue growth if any of our assumptions about expenses revenue or revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect or our attempts to improve efficiency are not successful our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated and our financial results will be negatively impacted 

we continually reevaluate our software licensing programs and subscription renewal programs including specific license models delivery methods and terms and conditions changes to our licensing programs and subscription renewal programs including the timing of the release of enhancements upgrades maintenance releases the term of the contract discounts promotions and other factors could impact the timing of the recognition of revenue for our products related enhancements and services and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition we may implement different licensing models which require the company to recognize licensing fees over a longer period over the last few years we have increasingly offered additional products through a saas model saas revenue is currently recognized ratably over the subscription period any significant increase in the percentage of our business generated from a subscription model could increase the amount of revenue to be recognized over time as opposed to upfront which would delay revenue recognition and have a negative impact on our operating results in a quarterly period due to these complexities we may not be able to accurately forecast our revenue which could cause us to miss our earnings estimates or revenue projections and negatively impact our stock price 

we face substantial competition in our markets which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition 

our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price quality and performance of our products the effectiveness of our distribution channel and direct sales force the level of customer service the development of new technology and our ability to participate in emerging markets within each of our markets we encounter direct competition from other gnss software optical and laser suppliers and competition may intensify from various larger us and nonus competitors and new market entrants particularly from emerging markets such as china our products which commonly use gnss for basic location information may be subject to competition from alternative location technologies such as simultaneous location and mapping technology  as we sell an increasing amount of software and subscription services we face competition from a group of large wellestablished companies with whom we have not previously competed our integrated hardware and software products may be subject to increasing competition from mass market devices such as smartphones and tablets used in conjunction with relatively inexpensive applications which have not been heavily used for commercial applications in the past these developments may require us to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes that we have not previously been exposed to including those related to cloud computing mobile devices and new computing platforms such competition has in the past resulted and 

in the future may result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the future against existing and additional competitors will depend largely on our ability to execute our strategy to provide products with significantly differentiated features compared to currently available products we may not be able to implement this strategy successfully and our products may not be competitive with other technologies or products that may be developed by our competitors many of whom have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing sales and other resources than we do 

we are dependent on new products and services and if we are unable to successfully introduce them into the market or to effectively compete with new disruptive product alternatives our customer base may decline or fail to grow as anticipated 

our future revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to bring new products and services to market on a timely basis we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products and services enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance of such products and services we may encounter problems in the future in innovating and introducing new products and services our development stage products may not be successfully completed or if developed may not achieve significant customer acceptance development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and we might not achieve our goals as to the timing of introducing new technology products or could encounter increased costs the timely availability and costeffective production of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success if we are unable to introduce new products and services if other companies develop competing technology products and services or if we do not develop compelling new products and services our number of customers may not grow as anticipated or may decline which could harm our operating results many of our offerings are increasingly focused on software and subscription services the software industry is characterized by rapidly changing customer preferences which require us to address multiple delivery platforms new mobile devices and cloud computing life cycles of software products can be short and this can exacerbate the risks associated with developing new products the introduction of thirdparty solutions embodying new disruptive technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could make our existing and future software solutions and other products obsolete or noncompetitive if we are not able to develop software and other solutions that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers or if we are unable to adapt to new platforms technologies or new industry standards that impact our markets our ability to retain or increase market share and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income in future periods 

as a global company we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities while we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business it is possible that these positions may be contested or overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities which may have a significant impact on our global provision for income taxes our effective tax rate is largely based on the geographic mix of earnings statutory rates intercompany transfer pricing and enacted tax laws a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates including 

 

tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied and governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax act which made substantial changes to us tax law the ongoing implementation and interpretation of the tax act any additional forthcoming legislative or administrative guidance and accounting standards related to the tax act could adversely affect our future effective tax rates the implementation by us of new practices and processes designed to comply with and benefit from the tax act and its rules and regulations could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices allocate additional resources and increase our costs which could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition in light of recent changes in us tax laws and to align with our international business operations in the fourth quarter of 2019 we completed a nonus intercompany transfer of our intellectual property to a subsidiary in the netherlands 

this transfer and other changes we make to practices and processes based upon changes in us and other tax laws are subject to challenge and an adverse outcome in any such challenge could adversely affect our reported financial results 

additionally longstanding international tax norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax crossborder international trade are evolving as a result of the beps reporting requirements recommended by the g8 g20 and the oecd the foreign countries where we do business may change tax laws regulations and interpretations on a prospective or retroactive basis and these potential changes could adversely affect our effective tax rates as these and other tax laws and related regulations change our financial results could be materially impacted given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow but such changes could adversely impact our financial results 

on june 1 2018 we filed a petition with the us tax court relating to a notice of deficiency pertaining to our 2011 tax year in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 we received a decision from the us tax court resulting in no changes to our federal income tax liability for 2011 we are currently in various stages of multiple year examinations by state and foreign taxing authorities if taxing authorities of any jurisdiction were to successfully challenge a material tax position we could become subject to higher taxes and our earnings would be adversely affected 

our debt could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations 

on november 24 2014 we issued 4000 million of 475 senior notes due december 1 2024 on june 15 2018 we issued 3000 million of 415 senior notes due june 15 2023 and 6000 million of 490 senior notes due june 15 2028 when our senior notes mature we will have to expend significant resources to repay these senior notes or seek to refinance them if we decide to refinance the senior notes we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the senior notes at all both of which may adversely affect our financial condition any downgrade by credit rating agencies could adversely affect our cost of borrowing limit our access to the capital markets or result in more restrictive covenants in future debt agreements 

in may 2018 we entered into a new credit agreement the “2018 credit facility” with jpmorgan chase bank na and certain other institutional lenders that provides for 175 billion of unsecured credit facilities comprised of a 125 billion loan facility maturing may 2023 the “revolving credit facility” and a 5000 million delayed draw term loan facility that matures on the third anniversary of the funding date the “term loan” subject to the terms of the 2018 credit facility we may request an additional loan facility up to 5000 million we also have two 750 million and one €1000 million that are uncommitted the “uncommitted facilities” at the end of 2019 and may be called by the lenders with very little notice at the end of fiscal 2019 our total debt was comprised primarily of senior notes of 13000 million a term loan balance of 2250 million  a revolver credit facility of 1100 million under the 2018 credit facility and three revolving credit facilities of 2187 million under the uncommitted facilities 

our outstanding indebtedness could have other important consequences such as 

 

there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and we may not be able to repay the indebtedness that becomes due a default under our debt instruments may also significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control a significant portion of our outstanding debt has interest rates which float based on prevailing interest rates and we may incur additional variablerate debt in the future such rates tend to fluctuate based on general economic conditions 

general interest rates federal reserve rates and the supply of and demand for credit in the relevant interbanking market in recent years the federal reserve has incrementally raised the target range for the federal funds rate with additional increases expected to come over the next year if interest rates increase our interest expense will also increase as would the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness or obtaining new debt 

our ability to incur additional indebtedness over time may be limited due to applicable financial covenants and restrictions and due to the risk that significantly increasing our level of indebtedness could impact the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations which in turn would increase the interest rates and fees that we pay in connection with our indebtedness 

some of our products rely on third party technologies including open source software which could result in product incompatibilities or harm availability of our products and services 

we license software technologies and intellectual property underlying some of our software from third parties the third party licenses we rely upon may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all and the software and technologies may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors resulting in development delays some software licenses are subject to annual renewals at the discretion of the licensors in some cases if we were to breach a provision of these license agreements the licensor could terminate the agreement immediately the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such third party software or technology could result in increased costs or delays in software releases or updates until such issues have been resolved this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and future prospects 

we also incorporate open source software into our products although we monitor our use of open source software the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market or sell our products or to develop new products in such event we could be required to seek licenses from thirdparties in order to continue offering our products to disclose and offer royaltyfree licenses in connection with our own source code to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis any of which could adversely affect our business 

we are dependent on proprietary technology which could result in litigation that could divert significant valuable resources 

our future success and competitive position is dependent upon our proprietary technology and we rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property the patents owned or licensed by us may be invalidated circumvented infringed or challenged the rights granted under these patents may not provide competitive advantages to us any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us if at all 

despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain our software or develop software with the same functionality or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology duplicate our technology or design around the patents owned by us in addition effective copyright patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in certain countries the steps taken by us to protect our technology might not prevent the misappropriation of such technology 

the value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many current patent filings third parties may claim that we or our customers some of whom are indemnified by us are infringing their intellectual property rights for example individuals and groups may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from us or our customers the number of these claims has increased in recent years as new patents are issued or are brought to our attention by the holders of such patents it may be necessary for us to secure a license from such patent holders redesign our products or withdraw products from the market in addition the legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant expense of operations any such litigation could require us to incur substantial costs and divert significant valuable resources including the efforts of our technical and management personnel which could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

we are dependent on limited source manufacturers and suppliers for certain of our products and critical components and a disruption in our supply chain could adversely affect our margins revenue and operating results 

we are dependent upon a limited number of contract manufacturers for the manufacture testing and assembly of certain products and specific suppliers for a number of our critical components our current reliance on a limited group of suppliers and contract manufacturers involves risks including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required products or components to meet customers’ delivery requirements a risk that we may accumulate excess inventories if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products reduced control over pricing and delivery schedules discontinuation of or increased prices for certain components and economic conditions that may adversely impact the viability of our suppliers and contract manufacturers any disruption in 

our supply chain could reduce our revenue and adversely impact our financial results such a disruption could occur as a result of any number of events including but not limited to increases in wages that drive up prices or labor stoppages the imposition of regulations quotas or embargoes on components a scarcity of or significant increase in the price of required electronic components for our products trade restrictions tariffs or duties fluctuations in currency exchange rates transportation failures affecting the supply chain and shipment of materials and finished goods third party interference in the integrity of the products sourced through the supply chain the unavailability of raw materials severe weather conditions natural disasters civil unrest military conflicts geopolitical developments war or terrorism and disruptions in utility and other services any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture assemble and test such components internally could significantly delay our ability to ship our products which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our reputation and brand as well as our operating results 

we are dependent on the availability and unimpaired use of allocated bands within the radio frequency spectrum and our products may be subject to harmful interference from new or modified spectrum uses 

our gnss technology is dependent on the use of satellite signals and on terrestrial communication bands international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union itu a specialized technical agency of the united nations these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference each country also has regulatory authority over how each band is used in the country in the united states the federal communications commission fcc and the national telecommunications and information administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations 

any itu or local reallocation of radio frequency bands including frequency band segmentation and sharing of spectrum or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our customers both of which could reduce demand for our products for example the fcc has been considering proposals to repurpose spectrum adjacent to the gps bands for terrestrial broadband wireless operations throughout the united states if the fcc were to permit implementation of such proposals or similar proposals terrestrial broadband wireless operations could create harmful interference to gps receivers within range of such operations and impose costs to retrofit or replace affected receivers similarly other countries have considered proposals for use of frequencies used by our products as well as adjacent bands that could cause harmful interference to our products 

many of our products use other radio frequency bands such as the public land mobile radio bands together with the gnss signal to provide enhanced gnss capabilities such as realtime kinematics precision the continuing availability of these nongnss radio frequencies is essential to provide enhanced gnss products to our precision survey agriculture and construction machine controls markets in addition transmissions and emissions from other services and equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or inband may impair the utility and reliability of our products any regulatory changes in spectrum allocation or in allowable operating conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

many of our products rely on gnss technology gps and other satellite systems which may become degraded or inoperable and result in lost revenue 

gnss technology gps satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible intentional disruption many of the gps satellites currently in orbit were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of operational satellites in orbit several have been in operation for 15 years or more repair of damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites a reduction in the number of operating satellites below the 24satellite standard established for gps may impair the utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities in addition software updates to gps satellites and ground control segments and infrequent known events such as gps week number rollover may adversely affect our products and customers we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of system updates to mitigate these problems which may not be available or complete 

we are dependent on continued operation of gps the principal gnss currently in operation the gps constellation is operated by the u s government which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps if supporting policies were to change or if user fees were imposed it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

many of our products also use signals from systems that augment gps such as the wide area augmentation system and national differential gps system and satellites transmitting signal corrections data on mobile satellite services frequencies utilized by our rtx corrections services some of these augmentation systems are operated by the us government and rely on continued funding and maintenance of these systems any curtailment of the operating capability of these systems or limitations on access to or use 

of the signals or discontinuance of service could result in degradation of our services or product performance with an adverse effect on our business 

many of our products use satellite signals from the russian glonass system other countries including china and india are in the process of creating their own gnss systems and we either have developed or will develop products which use gnss signals from these systems the european community is developing an independent radio navigation satellite system known as galileo national or european authorities may provide preferential access to signals to companies associated with their markets including our competitors which could harm our competitive position use of nonus gnss signals may also be subject to fcc waiver requirements and to restrictions based upon international trade or geopolitical considerations if we are unable to develop timely and competitive commercial products using these systems or obtain timely and equal access to service signals this could result in lost revenue these authorities may also adopt protectionist measures favoring national companies who make use of their gnss systems to the detriment of trimble products using the us gps system which would harm our business 

we are subject to the impact of governmental and other certifications processes and regulations which could adversely affect our products and our business 

we market many products that are subject to governmental regulations and certifications before they can be sold the european union increasingly regulates the use of our products on agriculture construction and other types of machinery ce certification is required for gnss receivers and data communications products which must conform to the european harmonized gnss receiver standard and the radio equipment directive to be sold in the european community delays in publication of the european harmonized gnss receiver standard could affect gnss product access to european markets in the future us european or other governmental authorities may propose gps receiver testing and certification for compliance with published gps signal interface or other specifications an inability to obtain any such certifications in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our operating results governmental authorities may also propose other forms of gps receiver performance standards which may limit design alternatives hamper product innovation or impose additional costs some of our products that use integrated radio communication technology require product type certification and some products require an enduser to obtain licensing from the fcc for frequencyband usage an inability or delay in obtaining such certifications or changes in applicable rules could adversely affect our ability to bring our products to market which could harm our customer relationships and therefore our operating results compliance with evolving product regulations in our major markets could require that we redesign our products cease selling products in certain markets and increase our costs of product development failure to comply may result in fines and limitations on sales of our products 

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes 

we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes can be difficult to predict management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability or may suffer unforeseen liabilities which could then impact the results of a financial period a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable which if not expected could harm our results of operations and financial condition

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that reflect our plans estimates and beliefs our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and those listed under “risks factors” this section of this form 10k generally discusses 2019 and 2018 items and yeartoyear comparisons between 2019 and 2018 discussions of 2017 items and yeartoyear comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this form 10k can be found in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item 7 of the companys annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 28 2018 

executive level overview 

trimble began operations in 1978 and was originally incorporated in california as trimble navigation limited in 1981 on october 1 2016 trimble navigation limited changed its name to trimble inc and changed its state of incorporation from the state of california to the state of delaware 

trimble is a leading provider of technology solutions that enable professionals and field mobile workers to improve or transform their work processes our comprehensive work process solutions are used across a range of industries including agriculture architecture civil engineering survey and land administration construction geospatial government natural resources transportation and utilities representative trimble customers include engineering and construction firms contractors owners surveying companies farmers and agricultural companies trucking companies energy utility companies and state federal and municipal governments 

trimble focuses on integrating its broad technological and application capabilities to create verticallyfocused systemlevel solutions that transform how work is done within the industries we serve the integration of sensors software connectivity and information in our portfolio gives us the unique ability to provide an information model specific to the customer’s workflow for example in construction our strategy is centered on the concept of a “constructible model” that is at the center of our “connected construction” solutions which provides realtime connected and cohesive information environments for the design build and operational phases of construction projects in agriculture we continue to develop “connected farm” solutions to optimize operations across the agriculture workflow in long haul trucking our “connected fleet” solutions provide transportation companies with tools to enhance fuel efficiency safety and transparency through connected vehicles and fleets across the enterprise 

our growth strategy is centered on multiple elements 



 trimble’s focus on these growth drivers has led over time to growth in revenue and profitability as well as an increasingly diversified business model software and subscription growth is driving increased recurring revenue leading to improved visibility in some of our businesses as our solutions have expanded our gotomarket model has also evolved with a balanced mix between direct distribution and oem customers and an increasing number of enterprise level customer relationships 

during fiscal 2019 the company acquired four businesses with total purchase consideration of 2470 million the largest acquisition was cityworks which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2019 cityworks is a provider of enterprise asset management eam software for utilities and local government 

during fiscal 2018 we acquired six businesses with total cash consideration of 18 billion the largest acquisition was viewpoint which we acquired in the third quarter of 2018 with total cash consideration of 12 billion viewpoint is a provider of construction management software which integrates a contractor’s financial and resource management to their project operations in the field the acquisition is highly complementary to our construction technology portfolio and positions us to further our strategy to lead the industrys transformation with viewpoint we offer customers a central workflow platform for delivering integrated endtoend construction management while further enabling connectivity across the complete construction life cycle 

in january 2020 a novel strain of coronavirus was identified in china resulting in shutdowns of manufacturing and commerce as well as global travel restrictions to contain the virus the impact has extended to other regions we have suppliers and employees in china and the region represents an end market for our products our customers and suppliers within china and other impacted countries are also affected by the coronavirus related restrictions and closures the coronavirus is expected to have a negative effect on our financial results for fiscal 2020 the full extent and duration are uncertain and could be material 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs of sales operating expenses and related disclosures we consider the accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting policies these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies our accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 of our accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services revenue is recognized net of allowance for returns and any taxes collected from customers we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations however determining whether products or services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may sometimes require significant judgment 

judgment is required to determine standalone selling price ssp for each distinct performance obligation we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when products and services are sold separately and determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services in instances where ssp is not directly observable we determine ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs 

income taxes 

we are a us based multinational company operating in multiple us and foreign jurisdictions judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual tax audit outcomes determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment changes in recognition 

or measurement of our uncertain tax positions would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

income taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred tax assets or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if we believe it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized 

we are subject to the periodic examination of our domestic and foreign tax returns by the irs state local and foreign tax authorities who may challenge our tax positions we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 

business combinations and valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree based on their fair values at the acquisition date the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill 

when determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to expected future cash flows which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins customer attrition rates future changes in technology and brand awareness loyalty and position and discount rates identifiable intangible assets are comprised of distribution channels and distribution rights patents licenses technology acquired backlog trademarks and inprocess research and development 

we evaluate goodwill at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist we utilize either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative test to assess the likelihood of an impairment in performing the qualitative assessment we consider macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors that may impact the reporting units when we perform a quantitative test the estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of certain estimates and assumptions including expected future operating performance using riskadjusted discount rates 

we amortize identifiable intangible assets over their estimated useful lives on a straightline basis changes in circumstances such as technological advances changes to its business model or changes in the capital strategy could result in a revised useful life if the useful life of an asset is revised the net book value of the estimated residual value is amortized over its revised remaining useful life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable based on their future cash flows the estimated future cash flows are primarily based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance

see supplemental disclosure of nongaap financial measures for a reconciliation of our gaap results to our nongaap measures 

basis of presentation 

we have a 5253 week fiscal year ending on the friday nearest to december 31 which for fiscal 2019 was january 3 2020  fiscal 2019 was a 53week year and 2018 and 2017 were 52week years 

revenue 

in fiscal 2019  total revenue increased by 1559 million  or 5  to 326 billion from 311 billion in fiscal 2018 overall revenue increased due to organic growth in buildings and infrastructure and to a lesser extent transportation and resources and utilities partially offset by a decrease in geospatial acquisitions including viewpoint contributed to growth particularly in service and subscription revenue we consider acquisition growth to include acquisition revenue that was not applicable in the prior corresponding periods 

by revenue category overall product revenue decreased 651 million  or 3  service revenue increased 975 million  or 17  and subscription revenue increased 1235 million  or 24  product revenue decreased primarily due to ongoing weakness in our geospatial oem hardware sales and to a lesser extent resources and utilities agriculture oem sales service and subscription revenue increased across all segments with the biggest impact due to an increase in buildings and infrastructure due to the viewpoint acquisition as well as organic growth and to a lesser extent transportation resources and utilities and geospatial 

by segment buildings and infrastructure revenue increased 1705 million  or 16  transportation increased 392 million  or 5  resources and utilities revenue increased 33 million or 1 and geospatial revenue decreased 737 million  or 10  as compared to fiscal 2018  buildings and infrastructure revenue increased due to the viewpoint acquisition which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and organic growth transportation revenue increased due to increased organic growth and acquisition revenue resources and utilities was up slightly due to organic and acquisition growth geospatial revenue decreased mainly due to market softness 

during fiscal 2019  sales to customers in north america represented 55 europe represented 28 asia pacific represented 11 and the rest of world represented 6 of our total revenue we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue 

no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenue in fiscal 2019 or 2018  no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our accounts receivable as of fiscal years ended 2019 and 2018  

gross margin 

our gross margin varies due to a number of factors including product mix pricing distribution channel production volumes new product startup costs and foreign currency translations 

in fiscal 2019  our gross margin increased by 999 million as compared to fiscal 2018  primarily due to increased organic service and subscription revenue growth in buildings and infrastructure as well as the viewpoint acquisition partially offset by a decrease in geospatial due to revenue declines gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was relatively flat at 546 in fiscal 2019 and 541 in fiscal 2018 due to buildings and infrastructure improved product mix largely offset by geospatial revenue decline and transportation product mix and pricing pressures 

operating income 

operating income increased by  552 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018  operating income as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2019 was 115 as compared to 103 for fiscal 2018  the increase in operating income was attributable to lower intangible asset amortization resulting from expiration of prior acquisitions amortization and strong operating results in buildings and infrastructure these increases were partially offset by geospatial revenue decline and transportation gross margin compression and increased research and development costs 

research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 

research and development rd sales and marketing sm and general and administrative ga expense are summarized in the following table 



overall rd sales and marketing and ga expenses increased by approximately 288 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018  

research and development expense increased by  236 million  or 5  in fiscal 2019  as compared to fiscal 2018  overall research and development spending was 14 of revenue in fiscal 2019 and 2018  respectively as compared to the prior year the increase in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the impact of the viewpoint acquisition and to a lesser extent increased compensation expenses in transportation partially offset by favorable foreign currency impacts 

we believe that the development and introduction of new products are critical to our future success and we expect to continue active development of new products 

sales and marketing expense increased by 244 million  or 5  in fiscal 2019  as compared to fiscal 2018  overall spending for sales and marketing was 15 of revenue in fiscal 2019 and 2018  respectively as compared to the prior year the increase in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the impact of the viewpoint acquisition and to a lesser extent an increase in compensation expense partially offset by favorable foreign currency impacts 

general and administrative expense decrease d by 192 million  or 5  in fiscal 2019  as compared to fiscal 2018  overall general and administrative spending was 10 and 11 of revenue in fiscal 2019 and 2018  respectively as compared to the prior year the decrease in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to lower compensation expense related to incentive compensation plans and to a lesser extent lower consulting costs and favorable foreign currency impacts partially offset by the impact of the viewpoint acquisition 

amortization of purchased intangible assets 



total amortization expense of purchased intangibles decreased  118 million as compared to fiscal 2018  the decrease was primarily due to the expiration of prior acquisitions amortization 

nonoperating income expense net 

the following table shows nonoperating income expense net for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

  

total nonoperating expense net decreased by 116 million during fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018  the decrease was due to increased joint venture profitability and a gain from the sale of an equity investment included in other income net partially offset by higher interest costs due to viewpoint acquisition debt being outstanding for a full year in fiscal 2019 

income tax provision 

the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act the tax act reduced the us federal tax rate from 35 to 21 imposed a onetime transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and created new taxes on certain foreignsourced earnings referred to as global intangible lowtaxed income gilti as a result we recorded a provisional net income tax expense of 802 million in fiscal 2017 in fiscal 2018 we completed the accounting for the tax effects of the tax act and made immaterial adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded previously additionally in fiscal 2018 we finalized our accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes in relation to gilti 

to align with our international business operations in the fourth quarter of 2019 we completed a nonus intercompany transfer of our intellectual property to a subsidiary in the netherlands the transaction resulted in deferred tax assets in the netherlands and gilti deferred tax liabilities in the us recorded at the applicable statutory tax rates resulting in a onetime income tax benefit of approximately 2063 million 

our effective income tax rates for fiscal 2019 and 2018 were 49 and 2 respectively the fiscal 2019 rate was lower than the us federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to a onetime tax benefit from a nonus intercompany transfer of intellectual property and benefits from reserve release due to expiration of the us federal statute of limitations for certain tax years the fiscal 2018 rate was lower than the us federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to benefits from reserve release due to expiration of the us federal statute of limitations for certain tax years a onetime benefit from deferred taxes in relation to gilti and benefits from stock based compensation 

results by segment 

we report our financial performance including revenue and operating income based on four reportable segments buildings and infrastructure geospatial resources and utilities and transportation 

our chief executive officer chief operating decision maker views and evaluates operations based on the results of our reportable operating segments under our management reporting system these results are not necessarily in conformance with us gaap for additional discussion of our segments see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

the following table is a breakdown of revenue and operating income by segment for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

  



a reconciliation of our consolidated segment operating income to consolidated income before income taxes follows 

  

buildings and infrastructure 

buildings and infrastructure revenue increased by 1705 million  or 16  and segment operating income increased by 632 million  or 25  for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018  revenue increased due to the impact of the viewpoint acquisition as well as strong organic growth building construction including viewpoint and civil engineering and construction experienced strong growth in service primarily software maintenance and subscription revenue segment operating income and operating income percentage increased due to organic revenue growth higher margin service and subscription product mix and improved operating expense control and to a lesser extent the impact of the viewpoint acquisition 

geospatial 

geospatial revenue decreased by 737 million  or 10  and segment operating income decreased by 342 million  or 21  for fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018  revenue decreased mainly due to continuing weakness in oem hardware sales primarily china and softness in geospatial survey sales the hardware revenue decline was partially offset by stronger software sales particularly in geospatial survey segment operating income and operating income percentage decreased primarily due to the negative impact from the revenue shortfall 

resources and utilities 

resources and utilities revenue increased by 33 million  or 1  and segment operating income increased by 09 million  or 1  for fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018  the revenue increased mainly due to growth in positioning services utilities and to a lesser extent acquisition revenue partially offset by weakness in agriculture oem and reseller hardware sales due to continued market uncertainties segment operating income increased slightly due to revenue growth and improved gross margin due to increased software service and subscription product mix operating income percentage was flat 

transportation 

transportation revenue increased by 392 million  or 5  while segment operating income decreased by 174 million  or 12  for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018  revenue increased primarily due to subscription growth as customers convert from software licenses and hardware growth from transportation customers segment operating income and operating income percentage decreased primarily due to gross margin compression resulting from hardware product mix as well as pricing pressures and increased research and development investments related to meeting demands of the electronic logging device regulatory mandate we expect revenue and operating income impacts from these factors to continue into fiscal 2020 as we meet the demands of the electronic logging device regulatory mandate 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than inventory purchases and other commitments incurred in the normal course of business see contractual obligations table below we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities 

in the normal course of business to facilitate sales of our products we indemnify other parties including customers lessors and parties to other transactions with us with respect to certain matters we may agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties these agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim in connection with divesting some of our businesses or assets we may also indemnify purchasers for certain matters in the normal course of business such as breaches of representations covenants or excluded liabilities in addition we entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents 

it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under these agreements were not material and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on the consolidated balance sheets at the end of fiscal 2019 and 2018 

liquidity and capital resources 

  



cash and cash equivalents 

our ability to continue to generate cash from operations will depend in large part on profitability the rate of collections of accounts receivable our inventory turns and our ability to manage other areas of working capital our cash and cash equivalents are maintained with several financial institutions deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions considered to be of reputable credit and to present little credit risk we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and borrowings as described below under the heading debt along with cash provided by operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs debt service stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program and planned capital expenditures 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 5850 million for fiscal 2019  as compared to 4867 million for fiscal 2018  the increase of 983 million was primarily driven by an increase in net income net of noncash items and favorable working capital requirements mainly resulting from an increase in deferred revenue associated with revenue growth partially offset by a decrease in accrued compensation and benefits 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 2753 million for fiscal 2019  as compared to 16496 million for fiscal 2018  the decrease of 13743 million used in investing activities was primarily due to spending for business acquisitions during fiscal 2018 including the 12121 million purchase of viewpoint and 4855 million purchase of ebuilder partially offset by proceeds from the sale of shortterm investments also in fiscal 2018 

financing activities 

cash used in financing activities was 2926 million for fiscal 2019  as compared to cash provided by financing activities of 9894 million during fiscal 2018  the decrease of cash provided by financing activities of 12820 million was primarily driven by the repayment of debt net of borrowings in fiscal 2019 as compared to the increase in debt proceeds net of repayments used to fund the viewpoint and ebuilder acquisitions in fiscal 2018 

debt 

during fiscal 2019 we repaid 1275 million of debt net of borrowings each of our debt agreements requires us to maintain compliance with certain debt covenants all of which we were in compliance with at the end of fiscal 2019 refer to note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our debt 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at the end of fiscal 2019  

  



  

 excluded from the table above are unrecognized tax benefits of 664 million included in other noncurrent liabilities including interest and penalties at this time we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with tax authorities regarding this liability and therefore such amounts are not included in the contractual obligations table above 

effect of new accounting pronouncements 

the impact of recent accounting pronouncements is disclosed in note 2 of our accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

s upplemental disclosure of nongaap financial measures 

to supplement our consolidated financial information we believe that the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future our nongaap measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap measures the nongaap financial measures and detailed explanations to the adjustments to comparable gaap measures are below 







nongaap revenue and operating income results 

nongaap revenue increased by  1393 million or 4 as compared to fiscal 2018 due to the impact of viewpoint which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and to a lesser extent organic growth in buildings and infrastructure and transportation and resources and utilities partially offset by geospatial due to market softness 

nongaap operating income increased by 239 million or 4 as compared to fiscal 2018 due to strong operating results in buildings and infrastructure partially offset by geospatial and transportation resources and utilities operating income was relatively flat 

nongaap explanations 

nongaap revenue 

we believe this measure helps investors understand the performance of our business as nongaap revenue excludes the effects of certain acquired deferred revenue that was written down to fair value in purchase accounting management believes that excluding fair value purchase accounting adjustments more closely correlates with the ordinary and ongoing course of the acquired company’s operations and facilitates analysis of revenue growth and business trends 

nongaap gross margin 

we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap gross margin as a way of understanding how product mix pricing decisions and manufacturing costs influence our business nongaap gross margin excludes the effects of acquired deferred revenue that was written down to fair value in purchase accounting restructuring charges amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup and acquisitiondivestiture items associated with the acceleration of acquisition stock options from gaap gross margin we believe that these adjustments offer investors additional information that may be useful to view trends in our gross margin performance 

nongaap operating expenses 

we believe this measure is important to investors evaluating our nongaap spending in relation to revenue nongaap operating expenses exclude restructuring charges amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation and acquisitiondivestiture items associated with external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition activities such as legal due diligence integration and other costs including the acceleration of acquisition stock options adjustment to the fair value of earnout liabilities and the effects of certain acquired capitalized commissions that were eliminated in purchase accounting from gaap operating expenses we believe that these adjustments offer investors supplemental information to facilitate comparison of our operating expenses to our prior results 

nongaap operating income 

we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap operating income trends which are driven by revenue gross margin and spending nongaap operating income excludes the effects of purchase accounting adjustments to certain acquired deferred revenue and acquired capitalized commissions restructuring charges amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup and acquisitiondivestiture items from gaap operating income we believe that these adjustments offer an alternative means for our investors to evaluate current operating performance compared to results of other periods 

nongaap nonoperating income expense net 

we believe this measure helps investors evaluate our nonoperating income trends nongaap nonoperating expense net excludes acquisitiondivestiture gainslosses associated with unusual acquisition related items such as intangible asset impairment charges gains or losses related to the acquisitions or sale of certain businesses and investments and debt issuance costs we believe that these exclusions provide investors with a supplemental view of our ongoing financial results 

nongaap income tax provision 

we believe that providing investors with the nongaap income tax provision is beneficial because it provides for consistent treatment of the excluded items in our nongaap presentation 

nongaap net income 

this measure provides a supplemental view of net income trends that are driven by nongaap income before taxes and our nongaap tax rate nongaap net income excludes the effects of purchase accounting adjustments to certain acquired deferred revenue and acquired capitalized commissions restructuring charges amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisitiondivestiture items debt issuance costs and nongaap tax adjustments from gaap net income we believe our investors benefit from understanding these adjustments and from an alternative view of our net income performance as compared to our past net income performance 

nongaap diluted net income per share 

we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap operating performance as reflected in a per share calculation as a way of measuring nongaap operating performance by ownership in the company nongaap diluted net income per share excludes the effects of purchase accounting adjustments to certain acquired deferred revenue and acquired capitalized commissions restructuring charges amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisitiondivestiture items debt issuance costs and nongaap tax adjustments from gaap diluted net 

income per share we believe that these adjustments offer investors a useful view of our diluted net income per share as compared to our past diluted net income per share 

adjusted ebitda 

we believe that adjusted ebitda assists investors in comparing our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis adjusted ebitda refers to nongaap operating income plus depreciation and income from equity method investments we also believe the measure provides useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors 

these nongaap measures can be used to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance as well as our performance relative to competitors we believe some of our investors track our core operating performance as a means of evaluating our performance in the ordinary ongoing and customary course of our operations core operating performance excludes items that are noncash not expected to recur or not reflective of ongoing financial results management also believes that looking at our core operating performance provides a supplemental way to provide consistency in periodtoperiod comparisons accordingly management excludes from nongaap those items relating to the effects of purchase accounting adjustments to certain acquired deferred revenue and acquired capitalized commissions restructuring charges amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisitiondivestiture items debt issuance costs and nongaap tax adjustments

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors 

market interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents consisted primarily of interest and noninterest bearing bank deposits as well as bank time deposits the main objective of these instruments is safety of principal and liquidity while maximizing return without significantly increasing risk 

due to the nature of our cash equivalents that they are readily convertible to cash we do not anticipate any material effect on our portfolio due to fluctuations in interest rates 

we are exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing interest rates under our credit facilities our 2018 credit facility is comprised of a fiveyear revolving loan facility with a maturity date of may 2023 and a threeyear term loan facility with a maturity date of may 2021 we also have three unsecured uncommitted revolving credit facilities that are callable by the bank at any time we may borrow funds under the 2018 credit facility in us dollars in the case of the term loan and us dollars euros or in certain other agreed currencies in the case of the revolving credit facility as described under note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

at the end of fiscal 2019  we had outstanding a term loan facility of 2250 million and a revolver credit facility of 1100 million under the 2018 credit facility and three revolving credit facilities of 2187 million under the uncommitted facilities a hypothetical 10 increase in our borrowing rates at the end of fiscal 2019 could result in approximately 56 million annual increase in interest expense on these existing principal balances 

the hypothetical changes and assumptions made above will be different from what actually occurs in the future furthermore the computations do not anticipate actions that may be taken by our management should the hypothetical market changes actually occur over time as a result actual earnings effects in the future will differ from those quantified above 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we operate in international markets which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and various foreign currencies the most significant of which is the euro 

historically the majority of our revenue contracts are denominated in us dollars with the most significant exception being europe where we invoice primarily in euros additionally a portion of our expenses primarily the cost to manufacture cost of personnel to deliver technical support on our products and professional services sales and sales support and research and development are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the euro 

revenue resulting from selling in local currencies and costs incurred in local currencies are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which can affect our operating income as exchange rates vary operating income may differ from expectations in fiscal 2019  revenue and operating income were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates by 438 million and 21 million respectively 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash debt and certain trade and intercompany receivables and payables primarily denominated in euros british pound new zealand dollars australian dollars brazilian real and canadian dollars these contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rate movements as the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses on the forward contracts these instruments are markedtomarket through earnings every period and generally range from one to two months in maturity we do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes we occasionally enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase price of some of our larger business acquisitions foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at the end of fiscal 2019 and 2018 are summarized as follows

patents licenses and intellectual property 

we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate we hold over 1200 unique issued and enforceable patents the majority of which cover gnss based technologies and other applications such as optical and laser technology we generally prefer to own the intellectual property used in our products either directly or through subsidiaries from time to time we license technology from third parties we are not dependent on any one patent and license we also own numerous trademarks and service marks that contribute to the identity and recognition of trimble and its global products and services 

competition 

our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future within our markets we encounter direct competition from other gnss software optical and laser suppliers such as hexagon and topcon and competition may intensify from various larger us and nonus competitors our hardware products are increasingly subject to competition from existing and new entrants from emerging markets such as china which compete aggressively on price at the lowerpriced end of the market our integrated hardware and software products may also be subject to increasing competition from mass market devices such as smartphones and tablets combined with relatively inexpensive applications which have not been heavily used for commercial applications in the past our software solutions are also increasingly subject to competition from existing and new entrants into the marketplace including from some companies that may have access to significantly more resources than trimble 

many of our products and solutions are focused on specific industries in each of these industries we face competition from companies providing point solutions or more traditionally less technology intensive products and services these companies often have greater financial resources and more established and recognized brands in those industries competing in vertical markets with more established industry participants requires that we successfully establish a market position and market new and sometimes unfamiliar technology and automated solutions to customers that have not previously used such products we also increasingly offer enterprise level solutions designed to meet the specific needs of our target industries in doing so we face competition from larger and more well established providers of enterprise software and services with whom we have not previously competed see also risk factors  we face substantial competition in our markets which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition 

sales and marketing 

we tailor our gotomarket strategies to the needs of our products and regional markets around the world in addition to direct sales many of our products are sold worldwide primarily through indirect channels including distributors dealers and authorized representatives occasionally we grant exclusive rights to market certain products or within specific countries these channels are supported by our regional sales offices throughout the world we also utilize distribution alliances oem relationships and joint ventures with other companies as a means to serve selected markets as well as direct sales to endusers 

seasonality of business 

construction equipment revenues within our buildings and infrastructure segment historically have been higher in early spring our agricultural equipment revenues within our resources and utilities segment have historically been the highest in the first quarter followed by the second quarter reflecting buying in anticipation of the spring planting season in the northern hemisphere however overall as a company as a result of diversification of our business across segments and the increased impact of subscription revenues we may experience less seasonality in the future changes in global macroeconomic conditions could also impact the level of seasonality we experience 

manufacturing 

we outsource the manufacturing of many of our hardware products to our key contract manufacturing partners that include flex ltd benchmark electronics inc and jabil our contract manufacturing partners are responsible for significant material procurement assembly and testing we continue to manage product design through pilot production for the subcontracted products and we are directly involved in qualifying suppliers and key components used in all our products our current contract with flex ltd continues in effect until either party gives the other ninety days written notice we also utilize original design manufacturers for some of our products

our design manufacturing and distribution sites in dayton ohio sunnyvale california danderyd sweden eindhoven netherlands auckland new zealand​ and shanghai china are registered to iso900120​15 covering the design production distribution and servicing of all our products 

research and development 

we believe that our competitive position is maintained through the development and introduction of new products including software and services that incorporate improved features and functionality better performance smaller size and weight lower cost or some combination of these factors we invest substantially in the development of new products we also make significant investment in the positioning communication and information technologies that underlie our products and will likely provide competitive advantages 

we expect to continue investing in research and development at a rate consistent with our past with the goal of maintaining or improving our competitive position and entering new markets

risks and uncertainties 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k and in any other documents to which we refer you in this form 10k before purchasing our securities the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect an investment in our common stock 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile during fiscal 2018 our stock price ranged from 2975 to 4570 we believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate perhaps substantially including 

 announcements and reports of developments related to our business our major customers and partners and the industries in which we compete or the industries in which our customers compete 

 in addition the stock market in general and the markets for shares of “hightech” companies in particular have frequently experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we operate globally and are subject to significant risks in many jurisdictions 

global or regional conditions may harm our financial results we have operations in many countries and a significant portion of our revenue is derived from countries outside of the united states as a result our operations and our financial results including our ability to design develop or sell products may be adversely affected by a number of factors outside of our control including 

 

a significant trade disruption or the establishment or increase of any trade barrier in any area where we do business including the asia pacific region could increase the cost of our products which could adversely impact the margin that we earn on sales make our products more expensive for customers or create uncertainty around demand for certain types of products which could make our products less competitive and reduce customer demand or otherwise have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits our and our customers’ businesses and our results of operations in response to us tariffs other countries may adopt tariffs and other trade barriers that could limit our ability to competitively offer our products and services recently the us government imposed tariffs on certain products imported into the us and the chinese government imposed tariffs on certain products imported into china tariffs may be increased in the future given the current us political climate and recent actions of the administration there is significant uncertainty about the trade policies treaties government regulations and tariffs that could apply to trade between the us and china as well as other nations in the future in addition if there is significant deterioration in the global economy the economies of the countries or regions where our customers are located or do business or the industries that we or our customers serve the demand for our products and services would likely decrease and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected changes in economic conditions and political uncertainty surrounding international trade also make it difficult to make financial forecasts which could cause us to miss our financial guidance and adversely affect our stock price 

we face risks inherent in conducting business internationally including compliance with international and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations these laws and regulations include data privacy requirements labor relations laws tax laws anticompetition regulations import and trade restrictions export control laws and laws that prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers including the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the uk bribery act or other anticorruption laws that have recently been the subject of a substantial increase in global enforcement many of our products are subject to us export law restrictions that limit the destinations and types of customers to which our products may be sold or require an export license in connection with sales outside the united states given the high level of complexity of these laws there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently or intentionally breached for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise also we may be held liable for actions taken by our local dealers and partners violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees and prohibitions or conditions on the conduct of our business any such violations could include prohibitions or conditions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our operating results 

we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced significant governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices we may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence or through other methods that relevant law and regulations prohibit us from using our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties 

existing privacyrelated laws and regulations in the united states and other countries are evolving and are subject to potentially differing interpretations and various us federal and state or other international legislative and regulatory bodies may expand or enact laws regarding privacy and data securityrelated matters for example the european union general data protection regulation became effective in may 2018 and is wideranging in scope in order to be compliant with the new eu requirements we must continue to invest resources necessary to implement and manage policy changes across our business units and services relating to how we collect and use personal data relating to customers employees and vendors failure to comply may lead to sizable fines in parallel with the advent of the euus privacy shield the new framework agreement between the us department of commerce and the european commission for transferring personal data from the european union to the united states and other national requirements we expect that the international transfer of personal data will present ongoing compliance challenges and complicate our business transactions countries outside the eu are considering or have passed legislation that requires local storage and processing of data which could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services 

we may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates although most of our sales occur in us dollars expenses may be paid in local currencies an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the us where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses as well as overseas capital expenditures we also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies our hedging programs reduce but do not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements therefore changes in exchange rates could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions could disrupt our operations acts of war acts of terrorism or civil unrest natural disasters and other catastrophic events especially any events that impact our larger markets or gnss signals or systems could 

have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military activity in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism or hostilities may involve a redeployment of the satellites used in gnss or interruptions of the system civil unrest local conflicts or other political instability may adversely impact regional economies cause work stoppages or result in limitations on business transactions with the affected foreign jurisdictions to the extent that such interruptions result in delays or the cancellation of orders disruption of the manufacturing or shipment of our products or reduced demand for our products these interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

engaging in international business inherently involves a number of other difficulties and risks 

these risks include 

 these factors or any combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue or our overall financial performance 

investing in and integrating new acquisitions could be costly place a significant strain on our management systems and resources or may fail to deliver the expected return on investment which could negatively impact our operating results 

we typically acquire a number of businesses each year and intend to continue to acquire other businesses in the past year two of our acquisitions viewpoint and ebuilder were acquired for 12113 million and 4852 million respectively acquisitions entail numerous risks including 

 

any such effects from acquisitions could be costly and place a significant strain on our management systems and resources 

as a result of acquisitions we have significant assets that include goodwill and other purchased intangibles the testing of goodwill and intangibles for impairment under established accounting guidelines requires significant use of judgment and assumptions changes in business conditions or in the prospects or results of operations of the acquired business could require negative adjustments to the valuation of these assets resulting in writeoffs which adversely affect our results if we divest a business and the proceeds are less than the net book value at the time we would be forced to write off the difference in addition changes in the operating results or the valuation of companies in which we have investments may have a direct impact on our financial statements or could result in our having to writedown the value of such investment 

even if successfully negotiated and closed acquisitions may not yield expected synergies may not advance our business strategy as expected may fall short of expected returnoninvestment targets or may not prove successful or effective for our business companies that we acquire may operate with different cost and margin structures which could further cause fluctuations in our operating results and adversely affect our operating margins 

our internal and customerfacing systems and systems of third parties we rely upon may be subject to cybersecurity breaches disruptions or delays 

a cybersecurity incident in our own systems or the systems of our third party providers may compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of our own internal data the availability of our products and websites designed to support our customers or our customer data computer hackers foreign governments or cyber terrorists may attempt to or succeed in penetrating our network security and our website unauthorized access to our proprietary business information or customer data may be obtained through breakins sabotage breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks employee theft or misuse breach of the security of the networks of our third party providers or other misconduct additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data we have experienced security breaches in the past and despite our efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our systems it is impossible to eliminate this risk for example in late 2015 and early 2016 we were the subject of an attack by hackers operating in china this incident resulted in the theft of proprietary and confidential data related to our gps technology but has not had a meaningful impact on our business because the techniques used by computer hackers who may attempt to penetrate and sabotage our network security or our website change frequently they may take advantage of weaknesses in third party technology or standards of which we are unaware or that we do not control and may not be recognized until long after they have been launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate or counter these techniques it is also possible that unauthorized access to customer data or confidential information may be obtained through inadequate use of security controls by customers vendors or business partners efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop implement and maintain such efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems a cybersecurity incident affecting our systems may also result in theft of our intellectual property proprietary data or trade secrets which would compromise our competitive position reputation and operating results we also may be required to notify regulators about any actual or perceived personal data breach including the eu lead data protection authority as well as the individuals who are affected by the incident within strict time periods 

the systems we rely upon also remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from a number of other factors including access to the internet the failure of our network or software systems or significant variability in visitor traffic on our product websites earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunication failures computer viruses human error and similar events or disruptions some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities our systems are also subject to intentional acts of vandalism despite any precautions we may take the occurrence of a natural disaster a decision by any of our thirdparty hosting providers to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could cause system interruptions and delays and result in loss of critical data and lengthy interruptions in our services 

we rely on our information systems and those of third parties for activities such as processing customer orders delivery of products hosting and providing services and support to our customers billing and tracking our customers hosting and managing our customer data and otherwise running our business any disruptions or unexpected incompatibilities in our information systems and those of the third parties upon whom we rely could have a significant impact on our business 

an increasing portion of our revenue comes from software as a service saas solutions and other hosted services in which we store retrieve communicate and manage data which is critical to our customers’ business systems disruption of our systems that support these services and solutions could cause disruptions in our customers’ systems and in the businesses that rely on these systems any such disruptions could harm our reputation create liabilities to our customers hurt demand for our services and solutions and negatively impact our revenues and profitability 

we may not be able to enter into or maintain important alliances and distribution relationships 

we believe that in certain business opportunities our success will depend on our ability to form and maintain alliances with industry participants such as caterpillar nikon hilti and cnh global our failure to form and maintain such alliances or the preemption or disruption of such alliances by actions of competitors will adversely affect our ability to sell our products to customers our relationships with substantial industry participants such as caterpillar and cnh are complex and multifaceted and are likely to evolve over time based upon the changing business needs and objectives of the parties since these strategic relationships contribute to significant ongoing business in certain of our important markets changes in these relationships could adversely affect our sales and revenues in addition we utilize dealer networks including those affiliated with some of our strategic allies such as caterpillar and cnh to market sell and service many of our products 

changes in our product mix including increasing provision of software and bundled solutions tailored to the needs of specific vertical markets impose new demands on our distribution channels and may require significant changes in the skills and expertise required to successfully distribute our products and services or the creation of new distribution channels recruiting and retaining 

qualified channel partners and training them in the use and the selling of our technology and product offerings requires significant time and resources in order to develop and expand our distribution channels we must continue to expand and improve our processes and procedures that support our distribution channels including our investment in systems and training and those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and difficult to manage the time and expense required for sales and marketing organizations of our channel partners to become familiar with our product offerings including our new product developments and newer types of offering such as software and services may make it more difficult to introduce those products to endusers and delay enduser adoption which could result in lower revenues 

disruption of dealer coverage within specific geographic or enduser markets could cause difficulties in marketing selling or servicing our products and have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition moreover dealers who carry products that compete with our products may focus their inventory purchases and sales efforts on goods provided by competitors due to industry demand or profitability such sourcing decisions can adversely impact our sales financial condition and results of operations 

our products are highly technical and may contain undetected errors product defects security vulnerabilities or software errors 

our products including our software products are highly technical and complex and when deployed may contain errors defects or security vulnerabilities we must develop our products quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing market and we have a history of frequently introducing new products products and services as sophisticated as ours could contain undetected errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new models or versions are released such occurrences could result in damage to our reputation lost revenue diverted development resources increased customer service and support costs warranty claims and litigation 

we warrant that our products will be free of defect for various periods of time depending on the product in addition certain of our contracts include epidemic failure clauses if invoked these clauses may entitle the customer to return or obtain credits for products and inventory or to cancel outstanding purchase orders even if the products themselves are not defective 

errors viruses or bugs may be present in software or hardware that we acquire or license from third parties and incorporate into our products or in third party software or hardware that our customers use in conjunction with our products our customers’ proprietary software and network firewall protections may corrupt data from our products and create difficulties in implementing our solutions changes to third party software or hardware that our customers use in conjunction with our software could also render our applications inoperable any errors defects or security vulnerabilities in our products or any defects in or compatibility issues with any third party hardware or software or customers’ network environments discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition loss of customers theft of trade secrets data or intellectual property and increased service and warranty cost any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products alone or in combination with third party hardware or software could expose them to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses and other malicious software programs that could attack our products actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could harm our reputation and lead some customers to return products to reduce or delay future purchases or use competitive products 

if we are unable to effectively manage our increasingly diverse and complex businesses and operations our ability to generate growth and revenue from new or existing customers may be adversely affected 

because our operations are geographically diverse and increasingly complex our personnel resources and infrastructure could become strained and our reputation in the market and our ability to successfully manage and grow our business may be adversely affected the size complexity and diverse nature of our business and the expansion of our product lines and customer base have placed increased demands on our management and operations and further growth if any may place additional strains on our resources in the future our ability to effectively compete and to manage our planned future growth will depend on among other things the following 

 

the company has increasingly diversified the nature of its businesses both organically and by acquisition as a result an increasing amount of our business involves business models which require managerial techniques and skill sets which are different from those required to manage our historical core businesses 

over the last few years we have focused more on saas subscription models as a result we expect to derive an increasing portion of our revenues in the future from subscriptions this subscription model provides our customers the right to access certain of our software in a hosted environment or use downloaded software for a specified subscription period market acceptance of such offerings is affected by a variety of factors including but not limited to security reliability performance current license terms customer preference socialcommunity engagement customer concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage their data public concerns regarding privacy and the enactment of restrictive laws or regulations if we are unable to successfully account for support and host our saas offerings in light of the foregoing risks and uncertainties our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate which could negatively impact our operations financial results and stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control results in any period could be affected by 

 seasonal variations in demand for our products may also affect our quarterly results construction equipment revenues have historically been the highest in early spring our agricultural equipment revenues have historically been the highest in the first quarter followed by the second quarter reflecting buying in anticipation of the spring planting season in the northern hemisphere if we do not accurately forecast seasonal demand we may be left with unsold inventory or have a shortage of inventory which could negatively impact our financial results 

due in part to the buying patterns of our customers a significant portion of our quarterly revenue occurs from orders received and immediately shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of each quarter while our operating expense tends to remain fairly predictable these patterns could harm our operating results if for any reason expected sales are deferred orders are not received or shipments are delayed a few days at the end of a quarter 

the price of our common stock could decline substantially in the event any of these risks result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors which are based on historical and predictive models that are not necessarily accurate representations of the future 

changes in our software and subscription businesses may negatively affect our operations and financial results 

an increasing portion of our revenue is generated through software maintenance and subscription revenue which includes saas our customers have no obligation to renew their agreements for our software maintenance or subscription services after the expiration of their initial contract period which typically ranges from one to five years our customer acquisition and renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including overall economic conditions the health of their businesses competitive offerings and customer dissatisfaction with our services if customers do not renew their contracts for our products our maintenance and subscription revenue will decline and our financial results will suffer any reduction in the number of licenses that we sell even if our customer acquisition rates do not change will have a negative impact on our future maintenance revenue growth if any of our assumptions about expenses revenue or revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect or our attempts to improve efficiency are not successful our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated and our financial results will be negatively impacted 

we continually reevaluate our software licensing programs and subscription renewal programs including specific license models delivery methods and terms and conditions changes to our licensing programs and subscription renewal programs including the 

timing of the release of enhancements upgrades maintenance releases the term of the contract discounts promotions and other factors could impact the timing of the recognition of revenue for our products related enhancements and services and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition we may implement different licensing models which require the company to recognize licensing fees over a longer period over the last few years we have increasingly offered additional products through a saas model saas revenues are currently recognized ratably over the subscription period any significant increase in the percentage of our business generated from such a subscription model could increase the amount of revenue to be recognized over time as opposed to upfront which would delay revenue recognition and have a negative impact on our operating results in a quarterly period due to these complexities we may not be able to accurately forecast our revenue which could cause us to miss our earnings estimates or revenue projections and negatively impact our stock price 

we face substantial competition in our markets which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition 

our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price quality and performance of our products the effectiveness of our distribution channel and direct sales force the level of customer service the development of new technology and our ability to participate in emerging markets within each of our markets we encounter direct competition from other gnss software optical and laser suppliers and competition may intensify from various larger us and nonus competitors and new market entrants particularly from emerging markets such as china our products which commonly use gnss for basic location information may be subject to competition from alternative location technologies such as simultaneous location and mapping technology  as we sell an increasing amount of software and subscription services we face competition from a group of large wellestablished companies with whom we have not previously competed our integrated hardware and software products may be subject to increasing competition from mass market devices such as smartphones and tablets used in conjunction with relatively inexpensive applications which have not been heavily used for commercial applications in the past these developments may require us to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes that we have not previously been exposed to including those related to cloud computing mobile devices and new computing platforms such competition has in the past resulted and in the future may result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the future against existing and additional competitors will depend largely on our ability to execute our strategy to provide products with significantly differentiated features compared to currently available products we may not be able to implement this strategy successfully and our products may not be competitive with other technologies or products that may be developed by our competitors many of whom have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing sales and other resources than we do 

we are dependent on new products and services and if we are unable to successfully introduce them into the market or to effectively compete with new disruptive product alternatives our customer base may decline or fail to grow as anticipated 

our future revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to bring new products and services to market on a timely basis we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products and services enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance of such products and services we may encounter problems in the future in innovating and introducing new products and services our development stage products may not be successfully completed or if developed may not achieve significant customer acceptance development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and we might not achieve our goals as to the timing of introducing new technology products or could encounter increased costs the timely availability and cost effective production of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success if we are unable to introduce new products and services if other companies develop competing technology products and services or if we do not develop compelling new products and services our number of customers may not grow as anticipated or may decline which could harm our operating results many of our offerings are increasingly focused on software and subscription services the software industry is characterized by rapidly changing customer preferences which require us to address multiple delivery platforms new mobile devices and cloud computing life cycles of software products can be short and this can exacerbate the risks associated with developing new products the introduction of thirdparty solutions embodying new disruptive technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could make our existing and future software solutions and other products obsolete or noncompetitive if we are not able to develop software and other solutions that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers or if we are unable to adapt to new platforms technologies or new industry standards that impact our markets our ability to retain or increase market share and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income in future periods 

as a global company we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities our effective tax rate is largely based on the geographic 

mix of earnings statutory rates intercompany transfer pricing and enacted tax laws a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates including 

 

we are subject to taxation in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax act which had a significant impact on our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 although we completed the accounting for the tax effects of the tax act as of the fourth quarter of 2018 any additional forthcoming legislative guidance and accounting standards related to the tax act could adversely affect our future effective tax rates the implementation by us of new practices and processes designed to comply with and benefit from the tax act and its rules and regulations could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices allocate additional resources and increase our costs which could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

additionally longstanding international tax norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax crossborder international trade are evolving as a result of the beps reporting requirements recommended by the g8 g20 and the oecd on october 5 2015 the oecd issued a series of reports recommending changes to numerous longstanding tax principles many of these recommendations are being adopted by various countries in which we do business and may increase our taxes in these countries the foreign countries where we do business may change tax laws regulations and interpretations on a prospective or retroactive basis and these potential changes could adversely affect our effective tax rates as these and other tax laws and related regulations change our financial results could be materially impacted given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow but such changes could adversely impact our financial results 

on june 1 2018 we filed a petition with the us tax court relating to a notice of deficiency pertaining to our 2011 tax year we are also currently in various stages of multiple year examinations by federal state and foreign taxing authorities including a review of our 2012 tax year by the us internal revenue service or irs if the tax court irs or the taxing authorities of any other jurisdiction were to successfully challenge a material tax position we could become subject to higher taxes and our earnings would be adversely affected 

our debt could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations 

on november 24 2014 we issued 4000 million of 475 senior notes due december 1 2024 on june 15 2018 we issued 3000 million of 415 senior notes due june 15 2023 and 6000 million of 490 senior notes due june 15 2028 when our senior notes mature we will have to expend significant resources to repay these senior notes or seek to refinance them if we decide to refinance the senior notes we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the senior notes at all both of which may adversely affect our financial condition 

in may 2018 we entered into a new credit agreement the “2018 credit facility” with jpmorgan chase bank na and certain other institutional lenders that provides for 175 billion of unsecured credit facilities comprised of a 125 billion loan facility maturing may 2023 the “revolving credit facility” and a 5000 million delayed draw term loan facility that matures on the third anniversary of the funding date the “term loan” subject to the terms of the 2018 credit facility we may request an additional loan facility up to 5000 million we also have two 750 million and one €1000 million uncommitted facilities which are uncommitted and may be called by the lenders with very little notice at the end of fiscal 2018 our total debt was comprised primarily of senior notes of 13000 million a term loan balance of 4250 million under the 2018 credit facility and three revolving credit facilities of 2559 million under the uncommitted facilities 

in april 2018 as a result of the announcement of the viewpoint acquisition and our plans to incur additional indebtedness moody’s investor service inc downgraded our ratings from baa2 to baa3 and while our standard  poor’s ratings were stable we received 

a negative outlook any downgrade by credit rating agencies could adversely affect our cost of borrowing limit our access to the capital markets or result in more restrictive covenants in future debt agreements 

our outstanding indebtedness could have other important consequences such as 

 

there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and we may not be able to repay the indebtedness that becomes due a default under our debt instruments may also significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control a significant portion of our outstanding debt has interest rates which float based on prevailing interest rates and we may incur additional variablerate debt in the future such rates tend to fluctuate based on general economic conditions general interest rates federal reserve rates and the supply of and demand for credit in the relevant interbanking market in recent years the federal reserve has incrementally raised the target range for the federal funds rate with additional increases expected to come over the next year if interest rates increase our interest expense will also increase as would the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness or obtaining new debt 

our ability to incur additional indebtedness over time may be limited due to applicable financial covenants and restrictions and due to the risk that significantly increasing our level of indebtedness could impact the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations which in turn would increase the interest rates and fees that we pay in connection with our indebtedness 

some of our products rely on third party technologies including open source software which could result in product incompatibilities or harm availability of our products and services 

we license software technologies and intellectual property underlying some of our software from third parties the third party licenses we rely upon may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all and the software and technologies may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors resulting in development delays some software licenses are subject to annual renewals at the discretion of the licensors in some cases if we were to breach a provision of these license agreements the licensor could terminate the agreement immediately the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such third party software or technology could result in increased costs or delays in software releases or updates until such issues have been resolved this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and future prospects 

we also incorporate open source software into our products although we monitor our use of open source software the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market or sell our products or to develop new products in such event we could be required to seek licenses from thirdparties in order to continue offering our products to disclose and offer royaltyfree licenses in connection with our own source code to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis any of which could adversely affect our business 

we are dependent on proprietary technology which could result in litigation that could divert significant valuable resources 

our future success and competitive position is dependent upon our proprietary technology and we rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property the patents owned or licensed by us may be invalidated circumvented infringed or challenged the rights granted under these patents may not provide competitive advantages to us any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us if at all 

despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain our software or develop software with the same functionality or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology duplicate our technology or design around the patents owned by us in addition effective copyright patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in certain countries the steps taken by us to protect our technology might not prevent the misappropriation of such technology 

the value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many current patent filings thirdparties may claim that we or our customers some of whom are indemnified by us are infringing their intellectual property rights for example individuals and groups may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from us or our customers the number of these claims has increased in recent years as new patents are issued or are brought to our attention by the holders of such patents it may be necessary for us to secure a license from such patent holders redesign our products or withdraw products from the market in addition the legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant expense of operations any such litigation could require us to incur substantial costs and divert significant valuable resources including the efforts of our technical and management personnel which could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

we are dependent on sole source and limited source manufacturers and suppliers for certain of our products and critical components and a disruption in our supply chain could adversely affect our margins revenues and operating results 

we are dependent upon a limited number of contract manufacturers for the manufacture testing and assembly of certain products including flex ltd as our preferred manufacturing partner for many of our gnss products and specific suppliers for a number of our critical components our current reliance on specific or a limited group of suppliers and contract manufacturers involves risks including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required products or components to meet customers’ delivery requirements a risk that we may accumulate excess inventories if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products reduced control over pricing and delivery schedules discontinuation of or increased prices for certain components and economic conditions which may adversely impact the viability of our suppliers and contract manufacturers any disruption in our supply chain could reduce our revenue and adversely impact our financial results such a disruption could occur as a result of any number of events including but not limited to increases in wages that drive up prices or labor stoppages the imposition of regulations quotas or embargoes on components a scarcity of or significant increase in the price of required electronic components for our products trade restrictions tariffs or duties fluctuations in currency exchange rates transportation failures affecting the supply chain and shipment of materials and finished goods third party interference in the integrity of the products sourced through the supply chain the unavailability of raw materials severe weather conditions natural disasters civil unrest military conflicts geopolitical developments war or terrorism and disruptions in utility and other services any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture assemble and test such components internally could significantly delay our ability to ship our products which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our reputation and brand as well as our operating results 

we are dependent on the availability and unimpaired use of allocated bands within the radio frequency spectrum and our products may be subject to harmful interference from new or modified spectrum uses 

our gnss technology is dependent on the use of satellite signals and on terrestrial communication bands international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union itu a specialized technical agency of the united nations these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference each country also has regulatory authority over how each band is used in the country in the united states the federal communications commission fcc and the national telecommunications and information administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations 

any itu or local reallocation of radio frequency bands including frequency band segmentation and sharing of spectrum or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our customers both of which could reduce demand for our products for example the fcc has been considering proposals to repurpose spectrum adjacent to the gps bands for terrestrial broadband wireless operations throughout the united states if the fcc were to permit implementation of such proposals or similar proposals terrestrial broadband wireless operations could create harmful interference to gps receivers within range of such operations and impose costs to retrofit or replace affected receivers similarly other countries have considered proposals for use of frequencies used by our products as well as adjacent bands that could cause harmful interference to our products 

many of our products use other radio frequency bands such as the public land mobile radio bands together with the gnss signal to provide enhanced gnss capabilities such as realtime kinematics precision the continuing availability of these nongnss radio frequencies is essential to provide enhanced gnss products to our precision survey agriculture and construction machine 

controls markets in addition transmissions and emissions from other services and equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or inband may impair the utility and reliability of our products any regulatory changes in spectrum allocation or in allowable operating conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

many of our products rely on gnss technology gps and other satellite systems which may become degraded or inoperable and result in lost revenue 

gnss technology gps satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible intentional disruption many of the gps satellites currently in orbit were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of 31 operational satellites in orbit nine have been in operation for more than 15 years and over half have been in use for more than 75 years repair of damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites a reduction in the number of operating satellites below the 24satellite standard established for gps may impair the utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities in addition software updates to gps satellites and ground control segments and infrequent known events such as gps week number rollover may adversely affect our products and customers we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of system updates to mitigate these problems which may not be available or complete 

we are dependent on continued operation of gps the principal gnss currently in operation the gps constellation is operated by the u s government which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps if supporting policies were to change or if user fees were imposed it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

many of our products also use signals from systems that augment gps such as the wide area augmentation system and national differential gps system and satellites transmitting signal corrections data on mobile satellite services frequencies utilized by our rtx corrections services some of these augmentation systems are operated by the us government and rely on continued funding and maintenance of these systems any curtailment of the operating capability of these systems or limitations on access to or use of the signals or discontinuance of service could result in degradation of our services or product performance with an adverse effect on our business 

many of our products use satellite signals from the russian glonass system other countries including china and india are in the process of creating their own gnss systems and we either have developed or will develop products which use gnss signals from these systems the european community is developing an independent radio navigation satellite system known as galileo national or european authorities may provide preferential access to signals to companies associated with their markets including our competitors which could harm our competitive position use of nonus gnss signals may also be subject to fcc waiver requirements and to restrictions based upon international trade or geopolitical considerations if we are unable to develop timely and competitive commercial products using these systems or obtain timely and equal access to service signals this could result in lost revenue these authorities may also adopt protectionist measures favoring national companies who make use of their gnss systems to the detriment of trimble products using the us gps system which would harm our business 

we are subject to the impact of governmental and other certifications processes and regulations which could adversely affect our products and our business 

we market many products that are subject to governmental regulations and certifications before they can be sold the european union increasingly regulates the use of our products on agriculture construction and other types of machinery ce certification is required for gnss receivers and data communications products which must conform to the european harmonized gnss receiver standard and the radio equipment directive to be sold in the european community delays in publication of the european harmonized gnss receiver standard could affect gnss product access to european markets in the future us european or other governmental authorities may propose gps receiver testing and certification for compliance with published gps signal interface or other specifications an inability to obtain any such certifications in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our operating results governmental authorities may also propose other forms of gps receiver performance standards which may limit design alternatives hamper product innovation or impose additional costs some of our products that use integrated radio communication technology require product type certification and some products require an enduser to obtain licensing from the fcc for frequencyband usage an inability or delay in obtaining such certifications or changes in applicable rules could adversely affect our ability to bring our products to market which could harm our customer relationships and therefore our operating results compliance with evolving product regulations in our major markets could require that we redesign our products cease selling products in certain markets and increase our costs of product development failure to comply may result in fines and limitations on sales of our products 

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes 

we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes can be difficult to predict management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability or may suffer unforeseen liabilities which could then impact the results of a financial period a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable which if not expected could harm our results of operations and financial condition

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that reflect our plans estimates and beliefs our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and those listed under “risks factors” 

executive level overview 

trimble inc is a leading provider of technology solutions that optimize the work processes of office and mobile field professionals around the world our comprehensive work process solutions are used across a range of industries including agriculture architecture civil engineering construction government natural resources transportation and utilities representative trimble customers include engineering and construction firms contractors surveying companies farmers and agricultural companies long haul trucking companies energy utility companies and state federal and municipal governments 

trimble focuses on integrating its broad technological and application capabilities to create verticallyfocused systemlevel solutions that transform how work is done within the industries we serve the integration of sensors software connectivity and information in our portfolio gives us the unique ability to provide an information model specific to the customer’s workflow for example in construction our strategy is centered on the concept of a “constructible model” which is at the center of our “connected site” solutions which provide realtime connected and cohesive information environments for the design build and operational phases of construction projects in agriculture we continue to develop “connected farm” solutions to optimize operations across the agriculture workflow in long haul trucking our “connected fleet” solutions provide transportation companies with tools to enhance fuel efficiency safety and transparency through connected vehicles and fleets across the enterprise 

our growth strategy is centered on multiple elements 



during 2018 we acquired ebuilder and viewpoint to expand our capabilities in construction software solutions these acquisitions expanded and reinforced our value proposition in the construction software market bringing enhanced capabilities and offerings in project and program management extensive relationships with project owners and an information backbone that enables realtime access to all the information needed to operate a construction enterprise these additional capabilities are enabling us to strengthen our reach to contractors and owners as we link detailed construction plans to the delivery and execution of construction projects ebuilder and viewpoint’s results of operations postacquisition are reflected in our buildings and infrastructure segment 

trimble’s focus on these growth drivers has led over time to growth in revenue and profitability as well as an increasingly diversified business model software and services growth is driving increased recurring revenue leading to improved visibility in some of our businesses as our solutions have expanded our go to market model has also evolved with a balanced mix between direct distribution and oem customers and an increasing number of enterprise level customer relationships 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs of sales operating expenses and related disclosures we consider the accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting policies these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies our accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 of our accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

revenue recognition 

we adopted the requirements of the new revenue recognition standard starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 utilizing the full retrospective method of transition revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services revenue is generally recognized net of allowance for returns and any taxes collected from customers we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations however determining whether products or services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may sometimes require significant judgment 

judgment is required to determine stand alone selling price ssp for each distinct performance obligation we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when products and services are sold separately and determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services in instances where ssp is not directly observable we determine ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs 

income taxes 

we are a us based multinational company operating in multiple us and foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual tax audit outcomes determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment changes in recognition or measurement of our uncertain tax positions would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

income taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred tax assets or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if we believe it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized 

we are subject to the periodic examination of our domestic and foreign tax returns by the irs state local and foreign tax authorities who may challenge our tax positions we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 

business combinations and valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree based on their fair values as of the acquisition date the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill 

when determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to expected future cash flows which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins customer attrition rates future changes in technology and brand awareness loyalty and position and discount rates fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability identifiable intangible assets are comprised of distribution channels and distribution rights patents licenses technology acquired backlog trademarks and inprocess research and development amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available 

we evaluate goodwill on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the annual goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year we utilize either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative test to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount in performing the qualitative assessment we consider events and circumstances including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors and overall financial performance when we perform a quantitative test the estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of certain estimates and assumptions including expected future operating performance using riskadjusted discount rates 

identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straightline method changes in circumstances such as technological advances changes to its business model or changes in the capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives of intangible assets differing from initial estimates if we determine that the useful life of an asset should be revised the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value is depreciated over its revised remaining useful life these assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable based on their future cash flows the estimated future cash flows are primarily based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance the assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the assets the assets are written down to the estimated fair value 

inventory valuation 

our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments are also made to reduce the cost of inventory for estimated excess or obsolete balances factors influencing these adjustments include declines in demand which impact inventory purchasing forecasts technological changes product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues if our estimates used to reserve for excess and obsolete inventory are different from what we expected we may be required to recognize additional reserves which would negatively impact our gross margin 

results of operations 

overview 

the following table is a summary of revenue gross margin and operating income for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

  



 see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

basis of presentation 

we have a 5253 week fiscal year ending on the friday nearest to december 31 which for fiscal 2018  was december 28 2018  fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  were all 52week years 

revenue 

in fiscal 2018  total revenue increased  by 4619 million  or 17  to 311 billion  from 265 billion  in fiscal 2017  overall revenue increased due to organic growth across all segments and most major regions acquisitions including ebuilder and viewpoint contributed to growth particularly in service and subscription revenue we consider acquisition growth to include acquisition revenue that was not applicable in the prior corresponding periods 

on a segment basis the increase in fiscal 2018  was primarily due to solid growth across segments including buildings and infrastructure and to a lesser extent resources and utilities transportation and geospatial buildings and infrastructure revenue increased 2572 million  or 31  resources and utilities revenue increased 861 million  or 18  transportation increased 748 million  or 11  and geospatial revenue increased 646 million  or 10  as compared to fiscal 2017  buildings and infrastructure revenue increased due to the ebuilder and viewpoint acquisitions which were acquired in the first and third quarters respectively and organic growth resources and utilities revenue increased primarily due to continued organic growth in agriculture markets as well as the impact of the müllerelektronik müller acquisition geospatial revenue increased mainly due to surveying organic growth and transportation revenue increased due to increased organic subscription growth from new and existing transportation and logistics customers and to a lesser extent product sales 

by revenue category overall product revenue increased   2361 million  or 13  service revenue increased   1133 million  or 24  and subscription revenue increased   1125 million  or 28  product revenue increased primarily due to organic growth in buildings and infrastructure due to building construction and civil engineering and construction product sales in geospatial due to surveying product sales and in resources and utilities due to agriculture product sales transportation contributed to a lesser extent service and subscription revenue increases were primarily due to growth in buildings and infrastructure including the impact of the viewpoint and ebuilder acquisitions and to a lesser extent transportation and resources and utilities 

in fiscal 2017  total revenue increased  by 2844 million  or 12  to 265 billion  from 236 billion  in fiscal 2016  overall revenue increased primarily due to organic growth across all segments and major regions to a lesser extent acquisitions contributed to growth particularly in product and service revenue 

on a segment basis the increase in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to transportation buildings and infrastructure resources and utilities and to a lesser extent geospatial transportation increased 903 million  or 15  buildings and infrastructure revenue increased 877 million  or 12  resources and utilities revenue increased 838 million  or 21  and geospatial revenue increased 228 million  or 4  as compared to fiscal 2017 transportation revenue increased due to continued organic growth in the transportation and logistics business buildings and infrastructure revenue increased primarily due to strong organic growth in 

civil engineering and construction and building construction resources and utilities revenue increased primarily due to acquisitions in particular the impact of müller acquisition and continued organic growth in agriculture correction services and forestry geospatial revenue increased mainly due to strong geospatial and surveying organic growth 

by revenue category overall product revenue increased 1932 million  or 12  service revenue increased 387 million  or 9  and subscription revenue increased 525 million  or 15  product service and subscription revenue increased primarily due to organic growth across all segments to a lesser extent acquisitions contributed to growth particularly in product and service revenue 

during fiscal 2018  sales to customers in north america represented 53 europe represented 28 asia pacific represented 13 and the rest of world represented 6 of our total revenue during fiscal 2017  sales to customers in north america represented 53 europe represented 26 asia pacific represented 14 and the rest of world represented 7 of our total revenue during fiscal 2016  sales to customers in north america represented 54 europe represented 24 asia pacific represented 15 and the rest of world represented 7 of our total revenue we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue 

no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenue in fiscal 2018  2017  or 2016  no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our accounts receivable as of fiscal years ended 2018  and 2017  

gross margin 

our gross margin varies due to a number of factors including product mix pricing distribution channel production volumes new product startup costs and foreign currency translations 

in fiscal 2018  our gross margin increased  by 3034 million  as compared to fiscal 2017  primarily due to increased revenue across all segments  buildings and infrastructure resources and utilities transportation and geospatial gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 541  in fiscal 2018  and 521  in fiscal 2017  the increase in gross margin percentage was primarily due to improved product mix across all segments partially offset by increased intangibles amortization and the effects of acquired deferred revenue from the ebuilder and viewpoint acquisitions that was written down to fair value in purchase accounting 

in fiscal 2017  our gross margin increased  by 1431 million  as compared to fiscal 2016  primarily due to increased revenue across all segments  buildings and infrastructure resources and utilities transportation and to a lesser extent geospatial gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 521  in fiscal 2017  and 523  in fiscal 2016  the slight decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions particularly müller 

operating income 

operating income increased  by  850 million  for fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  operating income as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2018  was 103  as compared to 89  for fiscal 2017  the increase in operating income was attributable to segment revenue and gross margin expansion and operating expense control partially offset by higher amortization of purchased intangible assets acquisition costs associated with the viewpoint and ebuilder acquisitions and expense related to the acceleration of ebuilder employee stock options in the first quarter 

operating income increased  by 553 million  for fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  operating income as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2017  was 89  as compared to 76  for fiscal 2016  the increases in operating income and operating income percentage were attributable to revenue expansion and strong operating control in buildings and infrastructure and to a lesser extent transportation resources and utilities and geospatial operating income was partially offset by higher corporate expense 

research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 

the following table shows research and development “rd” sales and marketing and general and administrative “ga” expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions of those operating expenses below 

  



 see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

overall rd sales and marketing and ga expenses increased  by approximately 2037 million  in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  

research and development expense increased  by  759 million  or 21  in fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  overall research and development spending was 14  of revenue in both fiscal 2018  and 2017  as compared to the prior year the increase in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions primarily viewpoint and ebuilder not applicable in the prior corresponding periods and to a lesser extent an increase in compensation expense associated with increased headcount particularly in transportation 

research and development expense increased  by 206 million  or 6  in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  overall research and development spending was 14  of revenue in fiscal 2017  compared to 15 in fiscal 2016  as compared to the prior year the increase in fiscal 2017  research and development expense was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense associated with increased headcount particularly in resources and utilities and to a lesser extent expense increase from fiscal 2017 business acquisitions primarily müller expenses not applicable in the prior corresponding periods 

we believe that the development and introduction of new products are critical to our future success and we expect to continue active development of new products 

sales and marketing expense increased  by 797 million  or 20  in fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  overall spending for sales and marketing was 15  of revenue in both fiscal 2018  and 2017  as compared to the prior year the increase in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions primarily viewpoint and ebuilder not applicable in the prior corresponding periods and to a lesser extent increased sales compensation expense 

sales and marketing expense increased  by 254 million  or 7  in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  overall spending for sales and marketing was 15  of revenue in fiscal 2017  compared to 16 in fiscal 2016  as compared to the prior year the increase in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense and to a lesser extent expense from fiscal 2017 business acquisitions not applicable in the prior corresponding periods 

general and administrative expense increased by 481 million  or 16  in fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  overall general and administrative spending was 11  of revenue in both fiscal 2018  and 2017  as compared to the prior year the increase in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions primarily viewpoint and ebuilder not applicable in the prior corresponding periods and increased stockbased compensation expense 

general and administrative expense increased by 457 million  or 18  as compared to fiscal 2016  overall general and administrative spending was 11  of revenue in both fiscal 2017  and 2016  as compared to the prior year the increase in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense which included an increase in stock compensation expense expense from fiscal 2017 business acquisitions and to a lesser extent and increase due to higher consulting costs mainly related to the asc 606 implementation 

amortization of purchased intangible assets 

  



total amortization expense of purchased intangibles increased  308 million  as compared to fiscal 2017  the increase was primarily due to amortization of new purchased intangibles related to viewpoint ebuilder and stabiplan acquisitions which were not applicable in the prior year total amortization expense of purchased intangibles decreased 20 million  as compared to fiscal 2016 the decrease was primarily due to the expiration of amortization for prior acquisitions partially offset by acquisitions not included in fiscal 2016 overall total amortization expenses of purchased intangibles represented 6 of revenue in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 

nonoperating income expense net 

the following table shows nonoperating income expense net for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

  

 see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

total nonoperating income expense net decreased  by 552 million  during fiscal 2018  compared with fiscal 2017  the decrease was primarily due to higher interest costs associated with increased debt and related costs in connection with fiscal 2018 acquisitions 

total nonoperating income expense net increased by 168 million  during fiscal 2017  compared with fiscal 2016  the increase was primarily due to an increase in joint venture profitability and to a lesser extent the favorable impact from foreign currency exchange 

income tax provision 

the tax act which reduced us federal tax rate from 35 to 21 imposed a onetime transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and created new taxes on certain foreignsourced earnings referred to as “gilti” we recorded reasonable estimates as provisional amounts arising from the tax act during the previous quarters including a provisional net income tax expense of 802 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 in the fourth quarter of 2018 we completed the accounting for the tax effects of the tax act and made immaterial adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded previously additionally in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we finalized our accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes in relation to gilti 

our effective income tax rates for fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 were 2 52 and 25 respectively the fiscal 2018 rate was lower than the us federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to benefits from reserve release due to expiration of the us federal statute of limitations for certain tax years a onetime benefit from deferred taxes in relation to gilti and benefits from stock based compensation the fiscal 2017 rate was higher than the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the impact of the tax act partially offset by the geographic mix of pretax income the us federal rd credit and stockbased compensation tax benefits the fiscal 2016 rate was less than the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the geographic mix of pretax income a divestiture of a nonstrategic business and the us federal rd credit 

results by segment 

we report our financial performance including revenues and operating income based on four reportable segments buildings and infrastructure geospatial resources and utilities and transportation 

our chief executive officer chief operating decision maker views and evaluates operations based on the results of our reportable operating segments under our management reporting system these results are not necessarily in conformance with us gaap beginning with the third quarter of fiscal 2018 we presented segment revenue and income excluding the effects of certain acquired deferred revenue that was written down to fair value in purchase accounting segment income also excludes the effects of certain acquired capitalized commissions that were eliminated in purchase accounting along with other adjustments that have historically been excluded in prior periods as though the acquired companies operated independently in the periods presented this presentation is consistent with the way the chief operating decision maker evaluates each segments performance and allocates resources comparative period financial information by reportable segment has been recast to conform with the current presentation 

for additional discussion of our segments see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

the following table is a breakdown of revenue and operating income by segment for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below

 see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

buildings and infrastructure 

buildings and infrastructure revenue increased  by 2572 million  or 31  while segment operating income increased  by 805 million  or 46  for fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  building construction experienced strong organic growth throughout the year across most markets and regions civil engineering and construction which introduced new products such as earthworks and siteworks contributed to growth in the fourth quarter this product family was impacted by lower government demand in addition to organic growth the ebuilder and viewpoint acquisitions which were acquired in the first and third quarters respectively contributed to growth particularly in service and subscription revenue segment operating income increased due to increased revenue and gross margin expansion due to product mix 

buildings and infrastructure revenue increased  by 877 million  or 12  while segment operating income increased  by 435 million  or 33  for fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  the revenue increase was primarily due to organic growth in building construction and civil engineering and construction due to continued strength in construction markets throughout the year buildings and infrastructure experienced strong growth in markets such as north america europe and asia pacific particularly in japan and australia segment operating income increased primarily due to revenue expansion and operating expense control across the segment 

geospatial 

geospatial revenue increased  by 646 million  or 10  while segment operating income increased  by 370 million  or 29  for fiscal year 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  the revenue increase was primarily due to organic growth for optical and gnss survey products across most major regions with north america and europe particularly strong new products end market diversification and stronger regional economies and to a lesser extent autonomy products contributed to the growth segment operating income increased primarily due to increased revenue and gross margin expansion due to the sale of higher margin products and operating expense control 

geospatial revenue increased  by 228 million  or 4  while segment operating income increased  by 88 million  or 7  for fiscal year 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  the revenue increase was primarily due to geospatial organic growth for optical and global navigation satellite systems products including the new sx 10 our scanning total station and end market diversification geospatial experienced growth with europe particularly strong segment operating income increased primarily due to revenue and gross margin expansion partially offset by higher operating expense 

resources and utilities 

resources and utilities revenue increased  by 861 million  or 18  while segment operating income increased  by 303 million  or 22  for fiscal year 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  the revenue increase was primarily due to continued growth in agriculture including the impact of the müller acquisition which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 growth in europe was up due to the müller acquisition and to a lesser extent agriculture organic growth growth in north america was up due to organic growth demand in asia pacific was weaker for agricultural products due to droughts in australia resources and utilities revenue 

declined slightly for the fourth quarter of 2018 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of uncertainty surrounding demand for agricultural products arising from the uschinese trade dispute which may also impact the first half of fiscal 2019 segment operating income increased due to increased revenue gross margin expansion due to product mix and operating expense control

it is not possible to determine the maximum potential exposure under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under these agreements have not been material and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on the consolidated balance sheets at the end of fiscal 2018  and 2017

cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

at the end of fiscal 2018 cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 1725 million compared to 5374 million at the end of fiscal 2017 we had a principal balance of outstanding debt of 19819 million at the end of fiscal 2018 compared to 9182 million at the end of fiscal 2017 as a result of the tax act we can repatriate our foreign earnings back to the us when needed with minimal us income tax consequences other than the transition tax and gilti we have reinvested a large portion of our undistributed foreign earnings in acquisitions and other investments and we intend to bring back a portion of foreign cash which was subject to the transition tax and gilti during fiscal 2018 we repatriated 6093 million of our foreign earnings to the us as a result of the tax act for further information on income taxes refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

our ability to continue to generate cash from operations will depend in large part on profitability the rate of collections of accounts receivable our inventory turns and our ability to manage other areas of working capital our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are maintained with several financial institutions deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions considered to be of reputable credit and to present little credit risk our investment policy requires the portfolio to include only securities with high credit quality and a weighted average maturity not to exceed six months with the main objective of preserving capital and maintaining liquidity we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities we classify our investments as shortterm investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations we believe that our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and borrowings as described below under the heading debt will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs debt service stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program and planned capital expenditures 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 4867 million  for fiscal 2018  as compared to 4297 million  for fiscal 2017  the increase  of 570 million  was primarily driven by an increase in net income net of noncash items and an increase in deferred revenue associated with revenue growth partially offset by a decrease in other liabilities for income taxes paid 

cash provided by operating activities was 4297 million  for fiscal 2017  as compared to 4311 million  for fiscal 2016  the decrease  of 14 million  was primarily driven by an increase in inventory requirements and accounts receivable associated with revenue growth largely offset by an increase in other liabilities for income taxes accrued due to the impact of the tax act 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 16496 million  for fiscal 2018  as compared to 3712 million  for fiscal 2017  the increase of 12784 million  used in investing activities of was primarily due to increased spending for business acquisitions including the 12113 million purchase of viewpoint and 4852 million purchase of ebuilder partially offset by proceeds from the sale of shortterm investments

financing activities 

cash provided by financing activities was 9894 million  for fiscal 2018  as compared to 665 million  during fiscal 2017  the increase of cash provided by financing activities of 9229 million  was primarily driven by the net proceeds from our debt facilities and our senior notes offering 

cash provided by financing activities was 665 million  for fiscal 2017  as compared to cash used of 1773 million  during fiscal 2016  the increase of cash provided by financing activities of 2438 million  was primarily driven by an increase in debt proceeds net of repayments partially offset by stock repurchases

 see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

accounts receivable days sales outstanding were at 59  days at the end of fiscal 2018  as compared to 56  days at the end of fiscal 2017  our accounts receivable days sales outstanding are calculated based on ending accounts receivable net divided by revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter times a quarterly average of 91 days our inventory turns were 49  at the end of fiscal 2018  as compared to 54  at the end of fiscal 2017  our inventory turnover is calculated based on total cost of sales for the most recent twelve months divided by average ending inventory net for this same twelve month period

effect of new accounting pronouncements 

the impact of recent accounting pronouncements is disclosed in note 2 of our accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

reconciliation of gaap to nongaap financial measures 

our nongaap measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap measures the nongaap financial measures included in the following tables as well as detailed explanations to the adjustments to comparable gaap measures are set forth below 

nongaap revenue 

we believe this measure helps investors understand the performance of our business as nongaap revenue excludes the effects of certain acquired deferred revenue that was written down to fair value in purchase accounting management believes that excluding fair value purchase accounting adjustments more closely correlates with the ordinary and ongoing course of the acquired company’s operations and facilitates analysis of revenue growth and business trends 

nongaap gross margin 

we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap gross margin as a way of understanding how product mix pricing decisions and manufacturing costs influence our business nongaap gross margin excludes the effects of certain acquired deferred revenue that was written down to fair value in purchase accounting restructuring charges amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup and acquisitiondivestiture items from gaap gross margin we believe that these adjustments offer investors additional information that may be useful to view trends in our gross margin performance 

nongaap operating expenses 

we believe this measure is important to investors evaluating our nongaap spending in relation to revenue nongaap operating expenses exclude restructuring charges amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation acquisitiondivestiture items associated with external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition activities such as legal due diligence integration and other costs including the acceleration of acquisition stock options as well as adjustment to the fair value of earnout liabilities executive transition costs and the effects of certain acquired capitalized commissions that were eliminated in purchase accounting from gaap operating expenses we believe that these adjustments offer investors supplemental information to facilitate comparison of our operating expenses to our prior results 

nongaap operating income 

we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap operating income trends which are driven by revenue gross margin and spending nongaap operating income excludes the effects of purchase accounting adjustments to certain acquired deferred revenue and acquired capitalized commissions restructuring charges amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisitiondivestiture items and executive transition costs from gaap operating income we believe that these adjustments offer an alternative means for our investors to evaluate current operating performance compared to results of other periods 

nongaap nonoperating income expense net 

we believe this measure helps investors evaluate our nonoperating income trends nongaap nonoperating income expense net excludes acquisitiondivestiture gainslosses associated with unusual acquisition related items such as intangible asset impairment charges and gains or losses related to the acquisition or sale of certain businesses and investments and debt issuance costs we believe that these exclusions provide investors with a supplemental view of our ongoing financial results 

nongaap income tax provision 

we believe that providing investors with the nongaap income tax provision is beneficial because it provides for consistent treatment of the excluded items in our nongaap presentation 

nongaap net income 

this measure provides a supplemental view of net income trends which are driven by nongaap income before taxes and our nongaap tax rate nongaap net income excludes the effects of purchase accounting adjustments to certain acquired deferred revenue and acquired capitalized commissions restructuring charges amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisitiondivestiture items executive transition costs debt issuance costs and nongaap tax adjustments from gaap net income we believe our investors benefit from understanding these adjustments and from an alternative view of our net income performance compared to our past net income performance 

nongaap diluted net income per share 

we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap operating performance as reflected in a per share calculation as a way of measuring nongaap operating performance by ownership in the company nongaap diluted net income per share excludes the effects of purchase accounting adjustments to certain acquired deferred revenue and acquired capitalized commissions restructuring charges amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisitiondivestiture items executive transition costs debt issuance costs and nongaap tax adjustments from gaap diluted net income per share we believe that these adjustments offer investors a useful view of our diluted net income per share compared to our past diluted net income per share 

adjusted ebitda 

we believe that adjusted ebitda assists investors in comparing our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis adjusted ebitda refers to nongaap operating income plus depreciation and income from equity method investments we also believe the measure provides useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors 

these nongaap measures can be used to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance as well as our performance relative to competitors we believe some of our investors track our core operating performance as a means of evaluating our performance in the ordinary ongoing and customary course of our operations core operating performance excludes items that are noncash not expected to recur or not reflective of ongoing financial results management also believes that looking at our core operating performance provides a supplemental way to provide consistency in period to period comparisons accordingly management excludes from nongaap those items relating to the effects of purchase accounting adjustments to certain acquired deferred revenue and acquired capitalized commissions restructuring charges amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisitiondivestiture items executive transition costs debt issuance costs and nongaap tax adjustments for detailed explanations of the adjustments made to comparable gaap measures see items  a    n  below 







 see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of adjustments 

 

 



growth strategies however we note that companies that grow internally will incur costs to develop intangible assets that will be expensed in the period incurred which may make a direct comparison more difficult   

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

   

 

nongaap operating income 

nongaap operating income increased  by 1724 million  for fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  and increased by 656 million  for fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  nongaap operating income as a percentage of total revenue was 206  178  and 172  for fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

the nongaap operating income and nongaap operating income percentage for fiscal 2018   increased  primarily due to revenue and operating income expansion across all segments

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors 

market interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents and shortterm investments consisted primarily of treasury bills debt securities and commercial paper interest and noninterest bearing bank deposits as well as bank time deposits the main objective of these instruments is safety of principal and liquidity while maximizing return without significantly increasing risk 

due to the nature of our cash equivalents and shortterm investments that they are readily convertible to cash we do not anticipate any material effect on our portfolio due to fluctuations in interest rates 

we are exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing interest rates under our credit facilities our 2018 credit facility is comprised of a fiveyear revolving loan facility with a maturity date of may 2023 and a threeyear term loan facility with a maturity date of may 2021 we also have three unsecured uncommitted revolving credit facilities that are callable by the bank at any time we may borrow funds under the 2018 credit facility in us dollars in the case of the term loan and us dollars euros or in certain other agreed currencies in the case of the revolving credit facility as described under note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

at the end of fiscal 2018  we had outstanding a term loan facility of 4250 million under the 2018 credit facility and three revolving credit facilities of 2559 million under the uncommitted facilities a hypothetical 10 increase in our borrowing rates at the end of fiscal 2018  could result in approximately 16 million annual increase in interest expense on these existing principal balances 

the hypothetical changes and assumptions made above will be different from what actually occurs in the future furthermore the computations do not anticipate actions that may be taken by our management should the hypothetical market changes actually occur over time as a result actual earnings effects in the future will differ from those quantified above 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we operate in international markets which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and various foreign currencies the most significant of which is the euro 

historically the majority of our revenue contracts are denominated in us dollars with the most significant exception being europe where we invoice primarily in euros additionally a portion of our expenses primarily the cost to manufacture cost of personnel to deliver technical support on our products and professional services sales and sales support and research and development are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the euro 

revenue resulting from selling in local currencies and costs incurred in local currencies are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which can affect our operating income as exchange rates vary operating income may differ from expectations in fiscal 2018  revenue and operating income were favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates by 235 million and 118 million respectively 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash debt certain trade and intercompany receivables and payables primarily denominated in euros british pound new zealand dollars australian dollars brazilian real and canadian dollars these contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rate movements as the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses on the forward contracts these instruments are markedtomarket through earnings every period and generally range from one to two months in maturity we do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes we occasionally enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase price of some of our larger business acquisitions foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at the end of fiscal 2018  and 2017  are summarized as follows

patents licenses and intellectual property 

we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate we hold over 1200 unique issued and enforceable patents the majority of which cover gnss based technologies and other applications such as optical and laser technology we generally prefer to own the intellectual property used in our products either directly or through subsidiaries from time to time we license technology from third parties we are not dependent on any one patent and license we also own numerous trademarks and service marks that contribute to the identity and recognition of trimble and its products and services globally 

competition 

our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future within our markets we encounter direct competition from other gnss software optical and laser suppliers such as hexagon and topcon and competition may intensify from various larger us and nonus competitors our hardware products are increasingly subject to competition from existing and new entrants from emerging markets such as china which compete aggressively on price at the lowerpriced end of the market our integrated hardware and software products may also be subject to increasing competition from mass market devices such as smartphones and tablets combined with relatively inexpensive applications which have not been heavily used for commercial applications in the past 

many of our products and solutions are focused on specific industries in each of these industries we face competition from companies providing point solutions or more traditional less technology intensive products and services and these companies often have greater financial resources and more established and recognized brands in those industries competing in vertical markets with more established industry participants requires that we successfully establish a market position and market new and sometimes unfamiliar technology and automated solutions to customers that have not previously used such products we also increasingly offer enterprise level solutions designed to meet the specific needs of our target industries in doing so we face competition from larger and more well established providers of enterprise software and services with whom we have not previously competed see also risk factors  we face substantial competition in our markets which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition 

sales and marketing 

we tailor our gotomarket strategies to the needs of our products and regional markets around the world in addition to direct sales many of our products are sold worldwide primarily through indirect channels including distributors dealers and authorized representatives occasionally we grant exclusive rights to market certain products or within specific countries these channels are supported by our regional sales offices throughout the world we also utilize distribution alliances oem relationships and joint ventures with other companies as a means to serve selected markets as well as direct sales to endusers 

during fiscal 2017  sales to customers in the united states represented 48 europe represented 26 asia pacific represented 14 and other regions represented 12 of our total revenue 

seasonality of business 

construction equipment revenues within our buildings and infrastructure segment historically have been higher in early spring our agricultural equipment revenues within our resources and utilities segment have historically been the highest in the first quarter followed by the second quarter reflecting buying in anticipation of the spring planting season in the northern hemisphere however overall as a company as a result of diversification of our business across segments and the increased impact of subscription revenues we may experience less seasonality in the future changes in global macroeconomic conditions could also impact the level of seasonality we experience 

manufacturing 

we outsource the manufacturing of many of our hardware products to our key contract manufacturing partners that include flex ltd benchmark electronics inc and jabil our contract manufacturing partners are responsible for significant material procurement assembly and testing we continue to manage product design through pilot production for the subcontracted products and we are directly involved in qualifying suppliers and key components used in all our products our current contract with flex ltd continues in effect until either party gives the other ninety days written notice we also utilize original design manufacturers for some of our products

risk factors 

tableend 

risks and uncertainties 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k and in any other documents to which we refer you in this form 10k before purchasing our securities the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate which could negatively impact our operations financial results and stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control results in any period could be affected by 

 seasonal variations in demand for our products may also affect our quarterly results construction equipment revenues have historically been the highest in early spring our agricultural equipment revenues have historically been the highest in the first quarter followed by the second quarter reflecting buying in anticipation of the spring planting season in the northern hemisphere if we do not accurately forecast seasonal demand we may be left with unsold inventory or have a shortage of inventory which could negatively impact our financial results 

due in part to the buying patterns of our customers a significant portion of our quarterly revenue occurs from orders received and immediately shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of each quarter while our operating expense tends to remain fairly predictable it could harm our operating results if for any reason expected sales are deferred orders are not received or shipments are delayed a few days at the end of a quarter 

the price of our common stock could decline substantially in the event any of these risks result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors which are based on historical and predictive models that are not necessarily accurate representations of the future 

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect an investment in our common stock 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile during fiscal 2017 our stock price ranged from 2861 to 4397 we believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate perhaps substantially including 



 in addition the stock market in general and the markets for shares of “hightech” companies in particular have frequently experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we operate globally and are subject to significant risks in many jurisdictions 

global or regional conditions may harm our financial results we have operations in many countries and a significant portion of our revenue is derived from countries outside of the united states as a result our operations and our financial results including our ability to design develop or sell products may be adversely affected by a number of factors outside of our control including 

 

if there is significant deterioration in the global economy the economies of the countries or regions where our customers are located or do business or the industries that we or our customers serve the demand for our products and services would likely decrease and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected changes in economic conditions also make it difficult to make financial forecasts which could cause us to miss our financial guidance and adversely affect our stock price 

we face risks inherent in conducting business internationally including compliance with international and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations these laws and regulations include data privacy requirements labor relations laws tax laws anticompetition regulations import and trade restrictions export control laws and laws which prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers including the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the uk bribery act or other anticorruption laws that have recently been the subject of a substantial increase in global enforcement many of our products are subject to us export law restrictions that limit the destinations and types of customers to which our products may be sold or require an export license in connection with sales outside the united states given the high level of complexity of these laws there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently or intentionally breached for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise also we may be held liable for actions taken by our local dealers and partners violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees and prohibitions or conditions on the conduct of our business any such violations could include prohibitions or conditions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our operating results 

a new european union data protection law the general data protection regulation which will become effective in may 2018 is wideranging in scope in order to meet the new eu requirements we will have to invest resources necessary to implement policy changes across our business units and services relating to how we collect and use personal data relating to customers employees and vendors failure to comply may lead to sizeable fines in parallel with the advent of the euus privacy shield 

the new framework agreement between the us department of commerce and the european commission for transferring personal data from the european union to the united states and other national requirements we expect that the international transfer of personal data will present ongoing compliance challenges and complicate our business transactions as we negotiate and implement suitable arrangements with international customers and international and domestic vendors countries outside the eu are considering or have passed legislation that requires local storage and processing of data which could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services 

in addition we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced significant governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices we may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence or through other methods that relevant law and regulations prohibit us from using our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties 

we may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates although most of our sales occur in us dollars expenses may be paid in local currencies an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the us where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses as well as overseas capital expenditures we also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies our hedging programs reduce but do not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements therefore changes in exchange rates could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions could disrupt our operations acts of war acts of terrorism or civil unrest natural disasters and other catastrophic events especially any events that impact our larger markets or gnss signals or systems could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military activity in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism or hostilities may involve a redeployment of the satellites used in gnss or interruptions of the system civil unrest local conflicts or other political instability may adversely impact regional economies cause work stoppages or result in limitations on business transactions with the affected foreign jurisdictions to the extent that such interruptions result in delays or the cancellation of orders disruption of the manufacturing or shipment of our products or reduced demand for our products it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

engaging in international business inherently involves a number of other difficulties and risks 

these risks include 

 these factors or any combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue or our overall financial performance 

we may not be able to enter into or maintain important alliances and distribution relationships 

we believe that in certain business opportunities our success will depend on our ability to form and maintain alliances with industry participants such as caterpillar nikon hilti and cnh global our failure to form and maintain such alliances or the preemption or disruption of such alliances by actions of competitors will adversely affect our ability to sell our products to customers our relationships with substantial industry participants such as caterpillar and cnh are complex and multifaceted and are likely to evolve over time based upon the changing business needs and objectives of the parties since these strategic relationships contribute to significant ongoing business in certain of our important markets changes in these relationships could adversely affect our sales and revenues 

we utilize dealer networks including those affiliated with some of our strategic allies such as caterpillar and cnh global to market sell and service many of our products changes in our product mix including increasing provision of software and bundled solutions tailored to the needs of specific vertical markets impose new demands on our distribution channels and may require significant changes in the skills and expertise required to successfully distribute our products and services or the creation of new distribution channels recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in the use and the selling of our technology and product offerings requires significant time and resources in order to develop and expand our distribution channels we must continue to expand and improve our processes and procedures that support our distribution channels including our 

investment in systems and training and those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and difficult to manage the time and expense required for sales and marketing organizations of our channel partners to become familiar with our product offerings including our new product developments and newer types of offering such as software and services may make it more difficult to introduce those products to endusers and delay enduser adoption which could result in lower revenues 

disruption of dealer coverage within specific geographic or enduser markets could cause difficulties in marketing selling or servicing our products and have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition moreover dealers who carry products that compete with our products may focus their inventory purchases and sales efforts on goods provided by competitors due to industry demand or profitability such sourcing decisions can adversely impact our sales financial condition and results of operations 

investing in and integrating new acquisitions could be costly place a significant strain on our management systems and resources or may fail to deliver the expected return on investment which could negatively impact our operating results 

we typically acquire a number of businesses each year and intend to continue to acquire other businesses acquisitions entail numerous risks including 

 

any such effects from acquisitions could be costly and place a significant strain on our management systems and resources 

as a result of acquisitions we have significant assets that include goodwill and other purchased intangibles the testing of goodwill and intangibles for impairment under established accounting guidelines requires significant use of judgment and assumptions changes in business conditions or in the prospects or results of operations of the acquired business could require negative adjustments to the valuation of these assets resulting in writeoffs which adversely affect our results if we divest a business and the proceeds are less than the net book value at the time we would be forced to write off the difference in addition changes in the operating results or stock price of companies in which we have investments may have a direct impact on our financial statements or could result in our having to writedown the value of such investment 

even if successfully negotiated and closed acquisitions may not yield expected synergies may not advance our business strategy as expected may fall short of expected returnoninvestment targets or may not prove successful or effective for our business companies that we acquire may operate with different cost and margin structures which could further cause fluctuations in our operating results and adversely affect our operating margins 

our internal and customerfacing systems and systems of third parties we rely upon may be subject to disruption delays or cybersecurity breaches 

a cybersecurity incident in our own systems or the systems of our third party providers may compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of our own internal data the availability of our products and websites designed to support our customers or our customer data computer hackers foreign governments or cyber terrorists may attempt to or succeed in penetrating our network security and our website unauthorized access to our proprietary business information or customer data may be obtained through breakins sabotage breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks employee theft or misuse breach of the security of the networks of our third party providers or other misconduct we have experienced security breaches in the past and despite our efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our systems it is virtually impossible to eliminate this risk we have experienced security breaches in the past and despite our efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our systems it is virtually impossible to eliminate this risk for example in late 2015 and early 2016 

we were the subject of an attack by hackers operating in china this incident resulted in the theft of proprietary and confidential data related to our gps technology but has not had a meaningful impact on our business because the techniques used by computer hackers who may attempt to penetrate and sabotage our network security or our website change frequently they may take advantage of weaknesses in third party technology or standards of which we are unaware or that we do not control and may not be recognized until after they have been launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate or counter these techniques it is also possible that unauthorized access to customer data may be obtained through inadequate use of security controls by customers vendors or business partners a cybersecurity incident affecting our systems may also result in theft of our intellectual property proprietary data or trade secrets which would compromise our competitive position reputation and operating results 

the systems we rely upon also remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from a number of other factors including access to the internet the failure of our network or software systems or significant variability in visitor traffic on our product websites earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunication failures computer viruses human error and similar events or disruptions some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities our systems are also subject to intentional acts of vandalism despite any precautions we may take the occurrence of a natural disaster a decision by any of our thirdparty hosting providers to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could cause system interruptions and delays and result in loss of critical data and lengthy interruptions in our services 

we rely on our information systems and those of third parties for activities such as processing customer orders delivery of products hosting and providing services and support to our customers billing and tracking our customers hosting and managing our customer data and otherwise running our business any disruptions or unexpected incompatibilities in our information systems and those of the third parties upon whom we rely could have a significant impact on our business 

an increasing portion of our revenue comes from software as a service saas solutions and other hosted services in which we store retrieve communicate and manage data which is critical to our customers’ business systems disruption of our systems which support these services and solutions could cause disruptions in our customers’ systems and in the businesses that rely on these systems any such disruptions could harm our reputation create liabilities to our customers hurt demand for our services and solutions and negatively impact our revenues and profitability 

our products are highly technical and may contain undetected errors product defects security vulnerabilities or software errors 

our products including our software products are highly technical and complex and when deployed may contain errors defects or security vulnerabilities we must develop our products quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing market and we have a history of frequently introducing new products products and services as sophisticated as ours could contain undetected errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new models or versions are released such occurrences could result in damage to our reputation lost revenue diverted development resources increased customer service and support costs warranty claims and litigation 

we warrant that our products will be free of defect for various periods of time depending on the product in addition certain of our contracts include epidemic failure clauses if invoked these clauses may entitle the customer to return or obtain credits for products and inventory or to cancel outstanding purchase orders even if the products themselves are not defective 

errors viruses or bugs may be present in software or hardware that we acquire or license from third parties and incorporate into our products or in third party software or hardware that our customers use in conjunction with our products our customers’ proprietary software and network firewall protections may corrupt data from our products and create difficulties in implementing our solutions changes to third party software or hardware that our customers use in conjunction with our software could also render our applications inoperable any errors defects or security vulnerabilities in our products or any defects in or compatibility issues with any third party hardware or software or customers’ network environments discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition loss of customers theft of trade secrets data or intellectual property and increased service and warranty cost any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products alone or in combination with third party hardware or software could expose them to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses and other malicious software programs that could attack our products actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could harm our reputation and lead some customers to return products to reduce or delay future purchases or use competitive products 

if we are unable to effectively manage our increasingly diverse and complex businesses and operations our ability to generate growth and revenue from new or existing customers may be adversely affected 

because our operations are geographically diverse and increasingly complex our personnel resources and infrastructure could become strained and our reputation in the market and our ability to successfully manage and grow our business may be adversely affected the size complexity and diverse nature of our business and the expansion of our product lines and customer base have placed increased demands on our management and operations and further growth if any may place additional strains on our resources in the future our ability to effectively compete and to manage our planned future growth will depend on among other things the following 

 

the company has increasingly diversified the nature of its businesses both organically and by acquisition as a result an increasing amount of our business involves business models which require managerial techniques and skill sets which are different from those required to manage our historical core businesses 

over the last few years we have focused more on saas subscription models as a result we expect to derive an increasing portion of our revenues in the future from subscriptions this subscription model provides our customers the right to access certain of our software in a hosted environment or use downloaded software for a specified subscription period market acceptance of such offerings is affected by a variety of factors including but not limited to security reliability performance current license terms customer preference socialcommunity engagement customer concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage their data public concerns regarding privacy and the enactment of restrictive laws or regulations if we are unable to successfully account for support and host our saas offerings in light of the foregoing risks and uncertainties our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

changes in our software and subscription businesses may negatively affect our operations and financial results 

an increasing portion of our revenue is generated through software maintenance and subscription revenue our customers have no obligation to renew their agreements for our software maintenance or subscription services after the expiration of their initial contract period which typically ranges from one to five years our customer acquisition and renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including overall economic conditions the health of their businesses competitive offerings and customer dissatisfaction with our services if customers do not renew their contracts for our products our maintenance and subscription revenue will decline and our financial results will suffer any reduction in the number of licenses that we sell even if our customer acquisition rates do not change will have a negative impact on our future maintenance revenue growth since its introduction our software as a service delivery model has also contributed to subscription revenue if any of our assumptions about expenses revenue or revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect or our attempts to improve efficiency are not successful our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated and our financial results will be negatively impacted 

we continually reevaluate our software licensing programs and subscription renewal programs including specific license models delivery methods and terms and conditions changes to our licensing programs and subscription renewal programs including the timing of the release of enhancements upgrades maintenance releases the term of the contract discounts promotions and other factors could impact the timing of the recognition of revenue for our products related enhancements and services and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition we may implement different licensing models which require the company to recognize licensing fees over a longer period over the last few years we have increasingly offered additional products through a saas model saas revenues are currently recognized ratably over the subscription period any significant increase in the percentage of our business generated from such a subscription model could increase the amount of revenue to be recognized over time as opposed to upfront which would delay revenue recognition and have a negative impact on our operating results in any quarterly period due to these complexities we may not be able to accurately forecast our revenue which could cause us to miss our earnings estimates or revenue projections and negatively impact our stock price 

we face substantial competition in our markets which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition 

our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price quality and performance of our products the effectiveness of our distribution channel and direct sales force the level of customer service the development of new technology and our ability to participate in emerging markets within each of our markets we encounter direct competition from other gnss software 

optical and laser suppliers and competition may intensify from various larger us and nonus competitors and new market entrants particularly from emerging markets such as china our products which commonly use gnss for basic location information may be subject to competition from alternative location technologies such as simultaneous location and mapping technology  as we sell an increasing amount of software and subscription services we face competition from a group of large well established companies with whom we have not previously competed our integrated hardware and software products may be subject to increasing competition from mass market devices such as smartphones and tablets used in conjunction with relatively inexpensive applications which have not been heavily used for commercial applications in the past these developments may require us to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes that we have not previously been exposed to including those related to cloud computing mobile devices and new computing platforms such competition has in the past resulted and in the future may result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the future against existing and additional competitors will depend largely on our ability to execute our strategy to provide products with significantly differentiated features compared to currently available products we may not be able to implement this strategy successfully and our products may not be competitive with other technologies or products that may be developed by our competitors many of whom have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing sales and other resources than we do 

we are dependent on new products and services and if we are unable to successfully introduce them into the market or to effectively compete with new disruptive product alternatives our customer base may decline or fail to grow as anticipated 

our future revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to bring new products and services to market on a timely basis we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products and services enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance of such products and services we may encounter problems in the future in innovating and introducing new products and services our development stage products may not be successfully completed or if developed may not achieve significant customer acceptance development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and we might not achieve our goals as to the timing of introducing new technology products or could encounter increased costs the timely availability and cost effective production of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success if we are unable to introduce new products and services if other companies develop competing technology products and services or if we do not develop compelling new products and services our number of customers may not grow as anticipated or may decline which could harm our operating results many of our offerings are increasingly focused on software and saas subscription services the software industry is characterized by rapidly changing customer preferences which require us to address multiple delivery platforms new mobile devices and cloud computing life cycles of software products can be short and this can exacerbate the risks associated with developing new products the introduction of thirdparty solutions embodying new disruptive technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could make our existing and future software solutions and other products obsolete or noncompetitive if we are not able to develop software and other solutions that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers or if we are unable to adapt to new platforms technologies or new industry standards that impact our markets our ability to retain or increase market share and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income in future periods 

as a global company we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities our effective tax rate is largely based on the geographic mix of earnings statutory rates intercompany transfer pricing and enacted tax laws a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates including 

 

we are subject to taxation in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax act the changes included in the tax act are broad and complex the final transition impacts of the tax act may differ from the estimates provided elsewhere in this report possibly materially due to among other things changes in interpretations 

of the tax act any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the tax act any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the tax act or any updates or changes to provisional estimates we have recorded regarding the tax act impacts including impacts from changes to foreign earnings estimates the impact of the newly enacted tax act to our future effective tax rates is uncertain and could adversely affect our effective tax rates the implementation by us of new practices and processes designed to comply with and benefit from the tax act and its rules and regulations could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices allocate additional resources and increase our costs which could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

additionally longstanding international tax norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax crossborder international trade are evolving as a result of the beps reporting requirements recommended by the g8 g20 and the oecd on october 5 2015 the oecd issued a series of reports recommending changes to numerous longstanding tax principles many of these recommendations are being adopted by various countries in which we do business and may increase our taxes in these countries the foreign countries where we do business may change tax laws regulations and interpretations on a prospective or retroactive basis and these potential changes could adversely affect our effective tax rates as these and other tax laws and related regulations change our financial results could be materially impacted given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow but such changes could adversely impact our financial results 

we are currently in various stages of multiple year examinations by federal state and foreign taxing authorities including a review of our 2010 to 2012 tax years by the us internal revenue service or irs if the irs or the taxing authorities of any other jurisdiction were to successfully challenge a material tax position we could become subject to higher taxes and our earnings would be adversely affected 

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us 

generally accepted accounting principles in the us are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board or fasb the sec and other bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles for example in may 2014 the fasb issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard asc 606 that replaces the current revenue recognition guidance under us gaap effective in fiscal 2018 the asc 606 revenue recognition standard establishes a principle for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services the standard also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining and fulfilling customer contracts this new standard is both technical and complex and we have incurred significant costs to implement and maintain compliance with this new standard the new standard may impact the timing and amounts of revenue recognized similarly a new lease standard asc 842 effective in fiscal 2019 replaces the current lease standard most prominent is the recognition of assets and liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under the current lease standard adoption of the new revenue recognition standard and lease standard along with any other changes in accounting principles or interpretations could also have a significant effect on our reported financial results any difficulties in the implementation of new or changed accounting standards could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations if our estimates relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions or judgments that change or prove to be incorrect our operating results could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price 

our debt could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations 

on november 24 2014 we issued senior notes notes due december 1 2024 in an aggregate principal amount of 4000 million the notes accrue interest at a rate of 475 per annum payable semiannually in arrears on december 1 and june 1 of each year beginning on june 1 2015 when the notes mature we will have to expend significant resources to repay these notes or seek to refinance them if we decide to refinance the notes we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the notes at all both of which may adversely affect our financial condition 

on november 24 2014 we entered into a new fiveyear credit agreement with a group of lenders the 2014 credit facility the 2014 credit facility provides for an unsecured revolving loan facility of 10 billion subject to the terms of the 2014 credit facility the revolving loan facility may be increased and term loan facilities may be established in an amount of up to 5000 million we also have two 750 million revolving credit facilities which are uncommitted and may be called by the lenders with very little notice the uncommitted facilities at the end of fiscal 2017 our total debt was comprised primarily of notes of 4000 million a revolving loan balance of 3890 million under the 2014 credit facility and a revolving credit line balance of 1280 million under the uncommitted facilities 

on february 2 2018 we entered into a 3000 million revolving credit agreement the “2018 interim credit facility” by and between the company and the bank of nova scotia in connection with the acquisition of ebuilder inc a florida corporation 

as of february 2 2018 after giving effect to the borrowings made on the closing date we had outstanding 3000 million aggregate principal amount of revolving loans under this credit facility 

our outstanding indebtedness could have important consequences such as 

 

there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and we may not be able to repay the indebtedness that becomes due a default under our debt instruments may also significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control a significant portion of our outstanding debt has interest rates which float based on prevailing interest rates if interest rates increase our interest expense will also increase 

our ability to incur additional indebtedness over time may be limited due to applicable financial covenants and restrictions and due to the risk that significantly increasing our level of indebtedness could impact the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations which in turn would increase the interest rates and fees that we pay in connection with our indebtedness 

some of our products rely on third party technologies including open source software which could result in product incompatibilities or harm availability of our products and services 

we license software technologies and intellectual property underlying some of our software from third parties the third party licenses we rely upon may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all and the software and technologies may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors resulting in development delays some software licenses are subject to annual renewals at the discretion of the licensors in some cases if we were to breach a provision of these license agreements the licensor could terminate the agreement immediately the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such third party software or technology could result in increased costs or delays in software releases or updates until such issues have been resolved this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and future prospects 

we also incorporate open source software into our products although we monitor our use of open source software the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market or sell our products or to develop new products in such event we could be required to seek licenses from thirdparties in order to continue offering our products to disclose and offer royaltyfree licenses in connection with our own source code to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis any of which could adversely affect our business 

we are dependent on proprietary technology which could result in litigation that could divert significant valuable resources 

our future success and competitive position is dependent upon our proprietary technology and we rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property the patents owned or licensed by us may be invalidated circumvented infringed or challenged the rights granted under these patents may not provide competitive advantages to us any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us if at all 

despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain our software or develop software with the same functionality or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology duplicate our technology or design around the patents owned by us in addition effective copyright patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in certain countries the steps taken by us to protect our technology might not prevent the misappropriation of such technology 

the value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many current patent filings thirdparties may claim that we or our customers some of whom are indemnified by us are infringing their intellectual property rights for example individuals and groups may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from us or our customers the number of these claims has increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future as new patents are issued or are brought to our attention by the holders of such patents it may be necessary for us to secure a license from such patent holders redesign our products or withdraw products from the market in addition the legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant expense of operations any such litigation could require us to incur substantial costs and divert significant valuable resources including the efforts of our technical and management personnel which could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

we are dependent on a specific manufacturer and assembler for many of our products and on other manufacturers and specific suppliers of critical parts for our products 

we are substantially dependent upon flex ltd as our preferred manufacturing partner for many of our gnss products under our agreement with flex we provide a twelvemonth product forecast and place purchase orders with flex at least thirty calendar days in advance of the scheduled delivery of products to our customers depending on production lead time although purchase orders placed with flex are cancelable the terms of the agreement would require us to purchase from flex all inventory not returnable or usable by other flex customers accordingly if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products we may be unable to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity from flex to meet customers’ delivery requirements or we may accumulate excess inventories if such inventories are not usable by other flex customers our current contract with flex continues in effect until either party gives the other ninety days written notice 

we rely on specific suppliers for a number of our critical components and on other contract manufacturers including benchmark electronics and jabil for the manufacture test and assembly of certain products and components we have experienced shortages of components in the past our current reliance on specific or a limited group of suppliers and contract manufacturers involves risks including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components reduced control over pricing and delivery schedules discontinuation of or increased prices for certain components and economic conditions which may adversely impact the viability of our suppliers and contract manufacturers this situation may be exacerbated during any period of economic recovery or a competitive environment any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture assemble and test such components internally could significantly delay our ability to ship our products which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our reputation and brand as well as our operating results 

we are dependent on the availability and unimpaired use of allocated bands within the radio frequency spectrum and our products may be subject to harmful interference from new or modified spectrum uses 

our gnss technology is dependent on the use of satellite signals and on terrestrial communication bands international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union itu a specialized technical agency of the united nations these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference each country also has regulatory authority over how each band is used in the country in the united states the federal communications commission fcc and the national telecommunications and information administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations 

any itu or local reallocation of radio frequency bands including frequency band segmentation and sharing of spectrum or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our customers both of which could reduce demand for our products for example the fcc has been considering proposals to repurpose spectrum adjacent to the gps bands for terrestrial broadband wireless operations throughout the united states if the fcc were to permit implementation of such proposals or similar proposals terrestrial broadband wireless operations could create harmful interference to gps receivers within range of such operations and impose costs to retrofit or replace affected receivers similarly other countries have considered proposals for use of frequencies used by our products as well as adjacent bands that could cause harmful interference to our products 

many of our products use other radio frequency bands such as the public land mobile radio bands together with the gnss signal to provide enhanced gnss capabilities such as realtime kinematics precision the continuing availability of these nongnss radio frequencies is essential to provide enhanced gnss products to our precision survey agriculture and construction machine controls markets in addition transmissions and emissions from other services and equipment operating in adjacent frequency 

bands or inband may impair the utility and reliability of our products any regulatory changes in spectrum allocation or in allowable operating conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

many of our products rely on gnss technology gps and other satellite systems which may become degraded or inoperable and result in lost revenue 

gnss technology gps satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible intentional disruption many of the gps satellites currently in orbit were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of 31 operational satellites in orbit seven have been in operation for more than 15 years and over half have been in use for more than 75 years repair of damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites a reduction in the number of operating satellites below the 24satellite standard established for gps may impair the utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities in addition software updates to gps satellites and ground control segments can cause problems and we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of such updates to mitigate these problems 

we are dependent on continued operation of gps the principal gnss currently in operation the gps constellation is operated by the u s government which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps if supporting policies were to change or if user fees were imposed it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

many of our products also use signals from systems that augment gps such as the wide area augmentation system and national differential gps system and satellites transmitting signal corrections data on mobile satellite services frequencies utilized by our rtx corrections services some of these augmentation systems are operated by the us government and rely on continued funding and maintenance of these systems any curtailment of the operating capability of these systems or limitations on access to or use of the signals or discontinuance of service could result in degradation of our services or product performance with an adverse effect on our business 

many of our products use satellite signals from the russian glonass system other countries including china and india are in the process of creating their own gnss systems and we either have developed or will develop products which use gnss signals from these systems the european community is developing an independent radio navigation satellite system known as galileo national or european authorities may provide preferential access to signals to companies associated with their markets including our competitors which could harm our competitive position use of nonus gnss signals may also be subject to fcc waiver requirements and to restrictions based upon international trade or geopolitical considerations if we are unable to develop timely and competitive commercial products using these systems or obtain timely and equal access to service signals this could result in lost revenue these authorities may also adopt protectionist measures favoring national companies who make use of their gnss systems to the detriment of trimble products using the us gps system which would harm our business 

we are subject to the impact of governmental and other certifications processes and regulations which could adversely affect our products and our business 

we market many products that are subject to governmental regulations and certifications before they can be sold the european union increasingly regulates the use of our products on agriculture construction and other types of machinery ce certification is required for gnss receivers and data communications products which must conform to the european harmonized gnss receiver standard and the radio equipment directive to be sold in the european community delays in publication of the european harmonized gnss receiver standard could affect gnss product access to european markets in the future us governmental authorities may propose gps receiver testing and certification for compliance with published gps signal interface or other specifications an inability to obtain any such certifications in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our operating results governmental authorities may also propose other forms of gps receiver performance standards which may limit design alternatives hamper product innovation or impose additional costs some of our products that use integrated radio communication technology require product type certification and some products require an enduser to obtain licensing from the fcc for frequencyband usage an inability or delay in obtaining such certifications or changes in applicable rules could adversely affect our ability to bring our products to market which could harm our customer relationships and therefore our operating results compliance with evolving product regulations in our major markets could require that we redesign our products cease selling products in certain markets and increase our costs of product development failure to comply may result in fines and limitations on sales of our products 

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes 

we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes can be difficult to predict management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability or may suffer unforeseen liabilities which could then impact the results of a financial period a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable which if not expected could harm our results of operations and financial condition

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs of sales operating expenses and related disclosures we consider the accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting policies these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies our accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 of our accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

the following summary of our accounting policies does not give the effect to the adoption of asc 606 which became effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer or is uncertain revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 

contracts andor customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement shipping documents and customer acceptance when applicable are used to verify delivery we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analyses as well as the customer’s payment history 

revenue for orders is not recognized until the product is shipped and title has transferred to the buyer we bear all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods up to that point our shipment terms for us orders and international orders fulfilled from our european distribution center typically provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the carrier named by the buyer at the named place or point if no precise point is indicated by the buyer delivery is deemed to occur when the carrier takes the goods into its charge from the place determined by us other shipment terms may provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the buyer shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 

revenue from sales to distributors and dealers is recognized upon shipment assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met distributors and dealers do not have a right of return 

revenue from purchased extended warranty and post contract support pcs agreements is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the warranty or support period revenue from our subscription services related to our hardware and applications is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription service period beginning on the date that service is made available to the customer assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been met 

we present revenue net of sales taxes and any similar assessments 

our software arrangements generally consist of a perpetual license fee and pcs we generally have established vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for our pcs contracts based on the renewal rate the remaining value of the software arrangement is allocated to the license fee using the residual method license revenue is primarily recognized when the software has been delivered and fair value has been established for all remaining undelivered elements in cases where vsoe of fair value for pcs is not established revenue is recognized ratably over the pcs period after all software deliverables have been made and the only the undelivered element is pcs 

for services performed on a fixedfee basis revenue is recognized using the proportional performance method with performance measured based on hours of work performed for contracts that involve significant customization and implementation or consulting services that are essential to the functionality of the software the license and services revenues are recognized using the percentageofcompletion method or if we are unable to reliably estimate the costs to complete the services we use the completedcontract 

method of accounting a contract is considered complete when all significant costs have been incurred or when acceptance from the customer has been received 

some of our subscription product offerings include hardware subscription services and extended warranty under these hosted arrangements the customer typically does not have the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without incurring a significant penalty and it is not feasible for the customer to run the software either on its own hardware or on a thirdparty’s hardware 

our multiple deliverable product offerings include hardware with embedded firmware extended warranty software pcs services and subscription services which are considered separate units of accounting for certain of our products software and nonsoftware components function together to deliver the tangible product’s essential functionality 

in evaluating the revenue recognition for our hardware or subscription agreements which contain multiple deliverables we determined that in certain instances we were not able to establish vsoe for some or all deliverables in an arrangement as we infrequently sold each element on a standalone basis did not price products within a narrow range or had a limited sales history when vsoe cannot be established we attempt to establish the selling price of each element based on relevant thirdparty evidence tpe tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately our offerings may contain a significant level of proprietary technology customization or differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained furthermore we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products’ selling prices are on a standalone basis therefore we typically are not able to establish the selling price of an element based on tpe 

when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe we use our best estimate of selling price besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis besp is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a standalone basis or for new or highly customized offerings we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including but not limited to pricing practices market conditions competitive landscape internal costs geographies and gross margin the determination of besp is made through consultation with and formal approval by our management taking into consideration our gotomarket strategy 

income taxes 

we are a united statesbased multinational company operating in multiple us and foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual tax audit outcomes determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment changes in recognition or measurement of our uncertain tax positions would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

income taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred tax assets or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if we believe it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized 

we are subject to the periodic examination of our domestic and foreign tax returns by the irs state local and foreign tax authorities who may challenge our tax positions we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 

on december 22 2017 the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act the tax act was enacted into law which significantly changes us income tax law and includes several key provisions that affect our business including a federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35 to 21 effective in 2018 among others we are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment such as determining the transition tax remeasuring our us deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities in addition the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax act “sab 118” which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date since the tax act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017 and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation are expected over the next year we consider the accounting of the transition tax deferred tax remeasurements indefinite reinvestment assertion and other items to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final yearend data and our tax positions in addition we have not yet determined our policy election as to whether we will recognize deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse as global intangible low taxed income “gilti” or whether we will account for gilti as a period cost if and when incurred we expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period in accordance with sab 118 

business combinations and valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree based on their fair values as of the acquisition date the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill 

when determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to expected future cash flows which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins customer attrition rates future changes in technology and brand awareness loyalty and position and discount rates fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability identifiable intangible assets are comprised of distribution channels and distribution rights patents licenses technology acquired backlog trademarks and inprocess research and development amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available 

we evaluate goodwill at a minimum on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year based on the values on the first day of that quarter goodwill was reviewed for impairment utilizing a quantitative twostep process when we perform a quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment the determination of fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions the discounted cash flows are based upon among other things assumptions about expected future operating performance using riskadjusted discount rates actual future results may differ from those estimates 

identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straightline method which approximates the pattern of economic benefits associated with these assets changes in circumstances such as technological advances changes to our business model or changes in the capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives of intangible assets differing from initial estimates in cases where we determine that the useful life of an asset should be revised the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value will be depreciated over its revised remaining useful life these assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable based on their future cash flows the estimated future cash flows are based upon among other things assumptions about expected future operating performance and these estimates may differ from actual future cash flows the assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value 

stockbased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to our employees and directors based on estimated fair values net of estimated forfeitures the awards include restricted stock units with timebased marketbased and performancebased vesting conditions rights to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plan and stock options 

the determination of fair value of sharebased payment awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors riskfree interest rates and any expected dividends in addition the binomial model incorporates actual optionpricing behavior and changes in volatility over the option’s contractual term 

the fair value of restricted stock units with marketbased vesting conditions is valued at the grant date using a monte carlo simulation the monte carlo simulation takes into account the same input assumptions as the binomial option pricing model as outlined above however it also incorporates into the fairvalue determination the possibility that the marketbased vesting conditions may not be satisfied and the impact of the possible differing stock price paths for trimble and each of the constituents of the sp 500 the fair value of our timebased and performancebased restricted stock units is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant and the total expense associated with the performancebased awards is based upon the expected achievement of the underlying performance goals and may be adjusted in future periods based upon changes in expectations and actual achievement 

the fair value of rights to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plan is estimated using the blackscholes optionpricing model and the fair value of our options is estimated using a binomial valuation model 

if factors change and we employ different assumptions to determine the fair value of our sharebased payment awards granted in future periods the compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 

stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest including the achievement of performancebased goals and estimated forfeitures if the performance goals achieved are different from what had been estimated or actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimates stockbased compensation recognized may not be reflective of what was earned in that period 

inventory valuation 

our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments are also made to reduce the cost of inventory for estimated excess or obsolete balances factors influencing these adjustments include declines in demand which impact inventory purchasing forecasts technological changes product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues if our estimates used to reserve for excess and obsolete inventory are different from what we expected we may be required to recognize additional reserves which would negatively impact our gross margin

our gross margin varies due to a number of factors including product mix pricing distribution channel production volumes new product startup costs and foreign currency translations 

in fiscal 2017  our gross margin increased  by 1546 million  as compared to fiscal 2016  primarily due to increased revenue across all segments  buildings and infrastructure transportation resources and utilities and to a lesser extent geospatial gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 525  in fiscal 2017  and 524  in fiscal 2016  the slight increase in the gross margin percentage was due to lower intangibles amortization due to fully amortized intangibles from prior acquisitions partially offset by intangibles from new acquisitions excluding the impact of intangibles amortization gross margin percentage slightly decreased due to the impact of acquisitions particularly müller 

in fiscal 2016  our gross margin increased  by 358 million  as compared to fiscal 2015  primarily due to increased revenue in buildings and infrastructure resources and utilities and transportation gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 524  in fiscal 2016  and 525  in fiscal 2015  the slight decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily in geospatial and transportation due to product mix partially offset by lower amortization of purchased intangible assets

results by segment 

in march 2017 we effected a change in the reporting of our segment financial results to better reflect our customer base and end markets beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we are reporting our financial performance including revenues and operating income based on four new reportable segments buildings and infrastructure geospatial resources and utilities and transportation comparative period financial information by reportable segment has been recast to conform with the current presentation 

operating income is revenue less cost of sales and operating expense excluding unallocated corporate expenses restructuring charges amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisition and divestiture items executive transition costs and litigation costs

total amortization expense of purchased intangibles represented 64  of revenue in fiscal 2016  a decrease  of 116 million  from fiscal 2015  when it represented 71  of revenue the decrease was primarily due to the expiration of amortization for prior acquisitions partially offset by acquisitions not included in fiscal 2015 

nonoperating income expense net 

the following table shows nonoperating income expense net for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

  

total nonoperating income expense net increased  by 174 million  during fiscal 2017  compared with fiscal 2016  the increase was primarily due to an increase in joint venture profitability and to a lesser extent the favorable impact from foreign currency exchange 

total nonoperating income expense net decreased by 17 million  during fiscal 2016  compared with fiscal 2015  the decrease was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency transaction fluctuations partially offset by deferred compensation gains included in other income net 

income tax provision 

our effective income tax rates for fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 were 53 25 and 20 respectively the fiscal 2017 rate was higher than the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the impact of the tax act partially offset by the geographic mix of pretax income the us federal rd credit and stockbased compensation tax benefits the fiscal 2016 rate was less than the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the geographic mix of pretax income a divestiture of a nonstrategic business and the us federal rd credit the fiscal 2015 rate was less than the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the geographical mix of our pretax income and to a lesser extent the inclusion of the current year us federal rd credit 

the tax act introduces significant changes to us income tax law effective in 2018 the tax act reduces the us statutory tax rate from 35 to 21 and creates new taxes on certain foreignsourced earnings and certain relatedparty payments which are referred to as gilti and the base erosion avoidance tax “beat” respectively in addition in 2017 we are subject to a onetime transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to us income tax accounting for the income tax effects of the tax act requires significant judgments and estimates 

in connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the tax act we have recorded a provisional estimate of discrete net tax expense of 850 million in fiscal year 2017 this discrete expense consists of provisional estimates of a 1260 million expense for the transition tax a 467 million benefit for adjustments to deferred tax liabilities associated with foreign earnings and tax reserves due to the transition tax a 33 million net expense for remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities for the us corporate tax rate reduction and a 24 million expense for state tax and foreign withholding taxes 

pursuant to sab 118 we recorded reasonable estimates as provisional amounts arising from the tax act in fiscal year 2017 these amounts include but are not limited to the amounts described above including the transition tax in addition we have not yet determined our policy election as to whether we will recognize deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse as gilti or whether we will account for gilti as a period cost if and when incurred we intend to perform additional analysis regarding historical foreign earnings and taxes as well as any other necessary potential adjustments and will complete the analysis within the one year measurement period by incorporating the additional analysis as well as ongoing legislation guidance and accounting interpretations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than operating leases inventory purchases and other commitments incurred in the normal course of business see contractual obligations table below we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities guarantee contracts retained or contingent interests in transferred assets or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity we do not have any majorityowned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements additionally we do not have any interest in or relationship with any special purpose entities 

in the normal course of business to facilitate sales of our products we indemnify other parties including customers lessors and parties to other transactions with us with respect to certain matters we have agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties these agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim from time to time in connection with divesting some of our businesses or assets we may also indemnify purchasers for certain matters in the normal course of business such as breaches of representations covenants or excluded liabilities in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents 

it is not possible to determine the maximum potential exposure under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under these agreements have not been material and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on the consolidated balance sheets at the end of fiscal 2017 and 2016 

liquidity and capital resources 

  



cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

at the end of fiscal 2017 cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 5374 million compared to 3272 million at the end of fiscal 2016 we had a principal balance of outstanding debt of 9182 million at the end of fiscal 2017 compared to 

6248 million at the end of fiscal 2016 as a result of the 2017 tax act we can repatriate our cumulative undistributed foreign earnings back to the us when needed with minimal us income tax consequences other than the transition tax we have reinvested a large portion of our undistributed foreign earnings in acquisitions and other investments and we intend to bring back a portion of foreign cash which was subject to the transition tax for further information on the transition tax refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

our ability to continue to generate cash from operations will depend in large part on profitability the rate of collections of accounts receivable our inventory turns and our ability to manage other areas of working capital 

our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are maintained with several financial institutions deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions considered to be of reputable credit and to present little credit risk our investment policy requires the portfolio to include only securities with high credit quality and a weighted average maturity not to exceed six months with the main objective of preserving capital and maintaining liquidity we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities we classify our investments as shortterm investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations we believe that our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and borrowings under our 2014 credit facility and 2018 interim credit facility as described below under the heading debt will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs debt service planned capital expenditures our 5000 million acquisition of ebuilder a florida corporation and stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program for at least the next twelve months 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 4119 million  for fiscal 2017  as compared to 4136 million  for fiscal 2016  the decrease  of 17 million  was primarily driven by revenue expansion across all segments partially offset by an increase in working capital requirements driven by inventory requirements and accounts receivable associated with revenue growth 

cash provided by operating activities was 4136 million  for fiscal 2016  as compared to 3570 million  for fiscal 2015  the increase  of 566 million  was due to an increase in net income before noncash depreciation and amortization primarily due to increased operating income in buildings and infrastructure and resources and utilities and also due to a decrease in working capital requirements due to inventory improvements 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 3660 million  for fiscal 2017  as compared to 1444 million  for fiscal 2016  the increase  of 2216 million  used in investing activities was primarily due to increased spending for business acquisitions and purchases of shortterm investments partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of shortterm investments and proceeds from sales of businesses 

cash used in investing activities was 1444 million  for fiscal 2016  as compared to 1724 million  for fiscal 2015  the decrease of cash used in investing activities was primarily due to less cash used for business and intangible asset acquisitions partially offset by the purchase of shortterm investments 

financing activities 

cash provided by financing activities was 791 million  for fiscal 2017  as compared to cash used of 1623 million  during fiscal 2016  the increase of cash provided by financing activities of 2414 million  was primarily driven by an increase in debt proceeds net of repayments partially offset by stock repurchases 

cash used in financing activities was 1623 million  for fiscal 2016  as compared to cash used of 2049 million  during fiscal 2015  the decrease of cash used in financing activities of 426 million  was primarily due to a decrease in cash used for stock repurchases partially offset by payments on revolving credit facilities 

accounts receivable and inventory metrics 

  

accounts receivable days sales outstanding were at 53  days at the end of fiscal 2017  as compared to 55  days at the end of fiscal 2016  due to improved collections our accounts receivable days sales outstanding are calculated based on ending accounts 

receivable net divided by revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter times a quarterly average of 91 days our inventory turns were 52  at the end of fiscal 2017  as compared to 48  at the end of fiscal 2016  due to improved inventory management our inventory turnover is calculated based on total cost of sales for the most recent twelve months divided by average ending inventory net for this same twelve month period to the extent that customer demand continues to increase inventory may be purchased in advance to reduce leads times as a result inventory turns may decrease 

debt 

notes 

on october 30 2014 we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission “sec” for the issuance of senior debt securities on november 24 2014 we issued 4000 million of senior notes “notes” under the shelf registration statement the notes mature on december 1 2024 and accrue interest at a rate of 475 per annum payable semiannually in arrears on december 1 and june 1 of each year beginning on june 1 2015 the notes are classified as longterm in the consolidated balance sheets

reconciliation of gaap to nongaap financial measures 

our nongaap measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap measures the nongaap financial measures included in the following table as well as detailed explanations to the adjustments to comparable gaap measures are set forth below 

nongaap gross margin 

we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap gross margin as a way of understanding how product mix pricing decisions and manufacturing costs influence our business nongaap gross margin excludes restructuring charges amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation and amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup from gaap gross margin we believe that these exclusions offer investors additional information that may be useful to view trends in our gross margin performance 

nongaap operating expenses 

we believe this measure is important to investors evaluating our nongaap spending in relation to revenue nongaap operating expenses exclude restructuring charges amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation acquisitiondivestiture items associated with external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition activities such as 

legal due diligence integration and other required closing costs executive transition costs and litigation costs from gaap operating expenses we believe that these exclusions offer investors supplemental information to facilitate comparison of our operating expenses to our prior results 

nongaap operating income 

we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap operating income trends which are driven by revenue gross margin and spending nongaap operating income excludes restructuring charges amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisitiondivestiture items associated with external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition activities such as legal due diligence integration and other required closing costs executive transition costs and litigation costs we believe that these exclusions offer an alternative means for our investors to evaluate current operating performance compared to results of other periods 

nongaap nonoperating income expense net 

we believe this measure helps investors evaluate our nonoperating income trends nongaap nonoperating income expense net excludes acquisitiondivestiture gainslosses associated with unusual acquisition related items such as intangible asset impairment charges gains or losses related to acquisitions or sale of certain businesses and investments we believe that these exclusions provide investors with a supplemental view of our ongoing financial results 

nongaap income tax provision 

we believe that providing investors with the nongaap income tax provision is beneficial because it provides for consistent treatment of the excluded items in our nongaap presentation the nongaap income tax provision excludes material nonrecurring items such as build and release of valuation allowances reserve releases related to closure of tax audits and other nonrecurring items we have not retroactively restated prior periods’ nongaap results with a similar separate rate therefore comparability between periods may be affected 

nongaap net income 

this measure provides a supplemental view of net income trends which are driven by nongaap income before taxes and our nongaap tax rate nongaap net income excludes restructuring charges amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisitiondivestiture items executive transition costs litigation costs and nongaap tax adjustments from gaap net income we believe our investors benefit from understanding these exclusions and from an alternative view of our net income performance as compared to our past net income performance 

nongaap diluted net income per share 

we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap operating performance as reflected in a per share calculation as a way of measuring nongaap operating performance by ownership in the company nongaap diluted net income per share excludes restructuring charges amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisitiondivestiture items executive transition costs litigation costs and nongaap tax adjustments from gaap diluted net income per share we believe that these exclusions offer investors a useful view of our diluted net income per share as compared to our past diluted net income per share 

these nongaap measures can be used to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance as well as our performance relative to competitors we believe some of our investors track our core operating performance as a means of evaluating our performance in the ordinary ongoing and customary course of our operations core operating performance excludes items that are noncash not expected to recur or not reflective of ongoing financial results management also believes that looking at our core operating performance provides a supplemental way to provide consistency in period to period comparisons accordingly management excludes from nongaap those items relating to restructuring charges amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisitiondivestiture items executive transition costs litigation costs and nongaap tax adjustments for detailed explanations of the adjustments made to comparable gaap measures see items a   k below 











 

nongaap operating income 

nongaap operating income increased  by 748 million  for fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  and increased by 156 million for fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  nongaap operating income as a percentage of total revenue was 181  172 and 170 for fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

the nongaap operating income and nongaap operating income percentage for fiscal 2017   increased  primarily attributable to revenue expansion across all segments and strong operating expense control in buildings and infrastructure and to a lesser extent transportation resources and utilities and geospatial

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors 

market interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents and shortterm investments consisted primarily of treasury bills debt securities and commercial paper interest and noninterest bearing bank deposits as well as bank time deposits the main objective of these instruments is safety of principal and liquidity while maximizing return without significantly increasing risk 

due to the nature of our cash equivalents and shortterm investments where they are readily convertible to cash we do not anticipate any material effect on our portfolio due to fluctuations in interest rates 

we are exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing interest rates under our credit facilities our 2014 credit facility is comprised of a revolving credit agreement and a letter of credit subfacility with maturity dates of november 24 2019 and also two unsecured uncommitted revolving credit agreements that are callable by the bank at any time we may borrow funds under these facilities in us dollars or in certain other currencies and borrowings will bear interest as described under note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 at the end of fiscal 2017  we had outstanding a revolving loan of 3890 million  under the 2014 credit facility and a revolving credit line of 1280 million  under the uncommitted facilities a hypothetical 10 increase in our borrowing rates at the end of fiscal 2017  could result in approximately 05 million annual increase in interest expense on these existing principal balances 

the hypothetical changes and assumptions made above will be different from what actually occurs in the future furthermore the computations do not anticipate actions that may be taken by our management should the hypothetical market changes actually occur over time as a result actual earnings effects in the future will differ from those quantified above 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we operate in international markets which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and various foreign currencies the most significant of which is the euro 

historically the majority of our revenue contracts are denominated in us dollars with the most significant exception being europe where we invoice primarily in euros additionally a portion of our expenses primarily the cost to manufacture cost of personnel to deliver technical support on our products and professional services sales and sales support and research and development are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the euro 

revenue resulting from selling in local currencies and costs incurred in local currencies are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which can affect our operating income as exchange rates vary operating income may differ from expectations in fiscal 2017  revenue and operating income were favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates by 83 million and 07 million respectively 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash and certain trade and intercompany receivables and payables primarily denominated in euro british pound new zealand dollars and canadian dollars these contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rate movements as the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses on the forward contracts these instruments are marked to market through earnings every period and generally range from one to two months in maturity we do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes we occasionally enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase price of some of our larger business acquisitions foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at the end of fiscal 2017  and 2016  are summarized as follows

patents licenses and intellectual property 

we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate we hold over 1200 unique issued and enforceable patents the majority of which cover gnss based technologies and other applications such as optical and laser technology we are not dependent on any one patent we also own numerous trademarks and service marks that contribute to the identity and recognition of trimble and its products and services globally we generally prefer to own the intellectual property used in our products either directly or through subsidiaries from time to time we license technology from third parties 

competition 

our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future within our markets we encounter direct competition from other gnss software optical and laser suppliers such as hexagon and topcon and competition may intensify from various larger us and nonus competitors our hardware products are increasingly subject to competition from existing and new entrants from emerging markets such as china which compete aggressively on price at the lower priced end of the market our integrated hardware and software products may also be subject to increasing competition from mass market devices such as smartphones and tablets combined with relatively inexpensive applications which have not been heavily used for commercial applications in the past 

many of our products and solutions are focused on specific industries in each of these industries we face competition from companies providing point solutions or more traditional less technology intensive products and services and these companies often have greater financial resources and more established and recognized brands in those industries competing in vertical markets with more established industry participants requires that we successfully establish a market position and market new and sometimes unfamiliar technology and automated solutions to customers that have not previously used such products we also increasingly offer enterprise level solutions designed to meet the specific needs of our target industries in doing so we face competition from larger and more well established providers of enterprise software and services with whom we have not previously competed see also risk factors  we face substantial competition in our markets which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition 

sales and marketing 

we tailor our distribution to the needs of our products and regional markets around the world many of our products are sold worldwide primarily through indirect channels including distributors dealers and authorized representatives occasionally we grant exclusive rights to market certain products or within specific countries these channels are supported by our regional sales offices throughout the world we also utilize distribution alliances oem relationships and joint ventures with other companies as a means to serve selected markets as well as direct sales to endusers 

during fiscal 2016 sales to customers in the united states represented 49 europe represented 24 asia pacific represented 15 and other regions represented 12 of our total revenue 

seasonality of business 

construction purchases tend to occur in early spring and us governmental agencies tend to utilize funds available at the end of the government’s fiscal year for additional purchases at the end of our third fiscal quarter in september of each year our agricultural equipment business revenues have historically been the highest in the first quarter followed by the second quarter reflecting buying in anticipation of the spring planting season in the northern hemisphere however overall as a company as a result of diversification of our business across segments and the increased impact of subscription revenues we may experience less seasonality in the future changes in global macroeconomic conditions could also impact the level of seasonality we experience 

backlog 

in most of our markets the time between order placement and shipment is short orders are generally placed by resellers and customers on an asneeded basis in general customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty for these reasons we do not believe that backlog is a meaningful indicator of future revenue or material to understanding our business   

manufacturing 

we outsource the manufacturing of many of our hardware products to our key contract manufacturing partners that include flextronics international limited benchmark electronics inc and jabil our contract manufacturing partners are responsible for significant material procurement assembly and testing we continue to manage product design through pilot production for the subcontracted products and we are directly involved in qualifying suppliers and key components used in all our products our current contract with flextronics continues in effect until either party gives the other ninety days written notice we also utilize original design manufacturers for some of our products 

we manufacture our laser and opticsbased products as well as some of our gps products at our plants in dayton ohio danderyd sweden and shanghai china some of these products or portions of these products are also subcontracted to third parties for assembly 

our design manufacturing and distribution sites in dayton ohio sunnyvale california danderyd sweden eersel netherlands auckland new zealand​ and shanghai china are registered to iso900120​15 covering the design production distribution and servicing of all our products 

research and development 

we believe that our competitive position is maintained through the development and introduction of new products including software and services that incorporate improved features and functionality better performance smaller size and weight lower cost or some combination of these factors we invest substantially in the development of new products we also make significant investment in the positioning communication and information technologies that underlie our products and will likely provide competitive advantages 

we expect to continue investing in research and development at a rate consistent with our past with the goal of maintaining or improving our competitive position and entering new markets 

employees 

at the end of fiscal 2016 we employed 8388 employees with approximately 55 of employees in locations outside the united states 

some employees in sweden and finland are represented by unions some employees in germany and france are represented by works councils we also employ temporary and contract personnel that are not included in the above headcount numbers we have not experienced work stoppages or similar labor actions

risks and uncertainties 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k and in any other documents to which we refer you in this form 10k before purchasing our securities the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate which could negatively impact our operations financial results and stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control results in any period could be affected by 



 seasonal variations in demand for our products may also affect our quarterly results construction purchases tend to occur in early spring and us governmental agencies tend to utilize funds available at the end of the government’s fiscal year for additional purchases at the end of our third fiscal quarter in september of each year our agricultural equipment business revenues have historically been the highest in the first quarter followed by the second quarter reflecting buying in anticipation of the spring planting season in the northern hemisphere if we do not accurately forecast seasonal demand we may be left with unsold inventory or have a shortage of inventory which could negatively impact our financial results 

due in part to the buying patterns of our customers a significant portion of our quarterly revenue occurs from orders received and immediately shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of each quarter while our operating expense tends to remain fairly predictable a majority of our sales force earns commissions on a quarterly basis which may cause concentrations of orders at the end of any fiscal quarter it could harm our operating results if for any reason expected sales are deferred orders are not received or shipments are delayed a few days at the end of a quarter 

the price of our common stock could decline substantially in the event any of these risks result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors which are based on historical and predictive models that are not necessarily accurate representations of the future 

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect an investment in our common stock 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile during fiscal 2016 our stock price ranged from 1836 to 3084 we believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate perhaps substantially including 

 in addition the stock market in general and the markets for shares of “hightech” companies in particular have frequently experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

global and regional economic conditions and the cyclicality of some of our key markets may negatively impact our businesses and our operating results 

our earnings and financial position are and will continue to be influenced by various macroeconomic factors including increases or decreases in gross domestic product the level of consumer and business confidence and spending changes in the interest rates on consumer and business credit fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates changes in tax rates or policy energy prices changes in international trade policies and the demand for and the cost of commodities such as corn which exist in the various countries in which we operate during 2016 we experienced a strengthening us dollar which had the impact of making some of our products and services more expensive than many of our local competitors developments with respect to trade policy and laws treaties or international accords related to imports and exports such as nafta or tariffs or other trade barriers which could be imposed by the us or by other countries could have a material adverse effect on our or on our suppliers’ or customers’ business 

in the recent past uncertainties in the financial and credit markets have caused our customers to postpone purchases and negative economic conditions may reduce future sales of or demand for our products and services negative economic conditions or changes in tax policy may depress the tax revenues of government entities which are significant purchasers of our products many 

of our products are sold through dealer channels and our dealers depend on the availability of credit both to finance purchases of our products for their inventory and to finance purchases by their customers sources of credit could disappear or the financial situation of our channel partners and customers could become such that they are no longer eligible for such financing or financing becomes more costly negative economic conditions may result in increased collection times or greater writeoffs affecting our cash flow and operating results our suppliers may be impacted by economic pressures which may adversely affect their ability to fulfill their obligations to us or result in increased prices and therefore cause a disruption in our supply chain or impact our operating results 

financial conditions in several regions continue to place significant economic pressures on existing and potential customers including our dealer channels there is ongoing concern about economic conditions in europe which has experienced negative impacts from sovereign debt levels and government taxing and spending actions to address such issues as well as the united kingdom’s exit from the european union other governments may continue to implement measures which may slow the economic growth rate in those countries eg higher interest rates and reduced bank lending growth rates in key emerging markets including china have slowed which could affect demand for our products both with respect to the products we sell directly into emerging markets and indirectly by reducing demand for our customers’ products falling commodity prices have also negatively affected markets such as the us canada the middle east and australia 

we are subject to the cyclicality of the agricultural and engineering and construction industries which can cause sudden and sometimes material declines in demand with negative effects on sales inventory levels and product pricing in general demand in the engineering and construction industries for our products is highly correlated to the economic cycle and can be subject to even greater levels of volatility the agricultural spending cycle is influenced by general economic conditions as well as weather crop loads commodity pricing the availability of credit and the strength of the us dollar since 2014 the agricultural sector has been experiencing a significant downturn and which has had and may have a negative effect on the company’s overall growth rate in addition new sources of supply and a decline in demand have resulted in a substantial decline in the price of oil and gas since 2014 and as a result the oil and gas industry has been experiencing a significant downturn which has had and may continue to have a negative effect on our engineering and construction business 

if there is significant deterioration in the global economy the economies of the countries or regions where our customers are located or do business or the industries that we or our customers serve the demand for our products and services would likely decrease and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected changes in economic conditions also make it difficult to make financial forecasts which could cause us to miss our financial guidance and adversely affect our stock price 

we may not be able to enter into or maintain important alliances and distribution relationships 

we believe that in certain business opportunities our success will depend on our ability to form and maintain alliances with industry participants such as caterpillar nikon hilti and cnh global our failure to form and maintain such alliances or the preemption or disruption of such alliances by actions of competitors will adversely affect our ability to sell our products to customers our relationships with substantial industry participants such as caterpillar and cnh are complex and multifaceted and are likely to evolve over time based upon the changing business needs and objectives of the parties since these strategic relationships contribute to significant ongoing business in certain of our important markets changes in these relationships could adversely affect our sales and revenues 

we utilize dealer networks including those affiliated with some of our strategic allies such as caterpillar and cnh global to market sell and service many of our products changes in our product mix including increasing provision of software and bundled solutions tailored to the needs of specific vertical markets impose new demands on our distribution channels and may require significant changes in the skills and expertise required to successfully distribute our products and services or the creation of new distribution channels recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in the use and the selling of our technology and product offerings requires significant time and resources in order to develop and expand our distribution channels we must continue to expand and improve our processes and procedures that support our distribution channels including our investment in systems and training and those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and difficult to manage the time and expense required for sales and marketing organizations of our channel partners to become familiar with our product offerings including our new product developments and newer types of offering such as software and services may make it more difficult to introduce those products to endusers and delay enduser adoption which could result in lower revenues 

disruption of dealer coverage within specific geographic or enduser markets could cause difficulties in marketing selling or servicing our products and have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition moreover dealers who carry products that compete with our products may focus their inventory purchases and sales efforts on goods provided by competitors due to industry demand or profitability such sourcing decisions can adversely impact our sales financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which can adversely affect our operating results 

fluctuations in currencies impact our operating results which are reported in us dollars a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the us and as such we face exposure to movements in the currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies these exposures may change over time as economic conditions and business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows during 2016 our business was negatively impacted by the strong us dollar which increased the cost of some of our products and services relative to those of local competitors in some jurisdictions if the us dollar remains strong or there is a continued increase in the exchange rate of the us dollar against other currencies it could negatively impact foreign demand for our products or reduce the dollar value of local currency sales a significant portion of our revenue is derived from countries outside of the united states possible import export tariff and other trade barriers which could be imposed by the us or other countries might have a material adverse effect on the business 

currently we routinely hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the short term impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities our attempts to hedge against these risks involve transaction costs and could be unsuccessful and expose us to losses 

investing in and integrating new acquisitions could be costly place a significant strain on our management systems and resources or may fail to deliver the expected return on investment which could negatively impact our operating results 

we typically acquire a number of businesses each year and intend to continue to acquire other businesses acquisitions entail numerous risks including 

 

any such effects from acquisitions could be costly and place a significant strain on our management systems and resources 

as a result of acquisitions we have significant assets that include goodwill and other purchased intangibles the testing of this goodwill and intangibles for impairment under established accounting guidelines requires significant use of judgment and assumptions changes in business conditions or in the prospects or results of operations of the acquired business could require negative adjustments to the valuation of these assets resulting in writeoffs which adversely affect our results if we divest a business and the proceeds are less than the net book value at the time we would be forced to write off the difference in addition changes in the operating results or stock price of companies in which we have investments may have a direct impact on our financial statements or could result in our having to writedown the value of such investment 

even if successfully negotiated and closed acquisitions may not yield expected synergies may not advance our business strategy as expected may fall short of expected returnoninvestment targets or may not prove successful or effective for our business companies that we acquire may operate with different cost and margin structures which could further cause fluctuations in our operating results and adversely affect our operating margins 

our internal and customerfacing systems and systems of third parties we rely upon may be subject to disruption delays or cybersecurity breaches that could adversely impact our customers and operations 

a cybersecurity incident in our own systems or the systems of our third party providers may compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of our own internal data the availability of our products and websites designed to support our customers or our customer data computer hackers foreign governments or cyber terrorists may attempt to or succeed in penetrating our network security and our website unauthorized access to our proprietary business information or customer data may be obtained 

through breakins sabotage breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks employee theft or misuse breach of the security of the networks of our third party providers or other misconduct we have experienced security breaches in the past and despite our efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our systems it is virtually impossible to eliminate this risk because the techniques used by computer hackers who may attempt to penetrate and sabotage our network security or our website change frequently may take advantage of weaknesses in third party technology or standards of which we are unaware or that we do not control and may not be recognized until after they have been launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate or counter these techniques it is also possible that unauthorized access to customer data may be obtained through inadequate use of security controls by customers vendors or business partners a cybersecurity incident affecting our systems may also result in theft of our intellectual property proprietary data or trade secrets which would compromise our competitive position reputation and operating results 

the systems we rely upon also remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from a number of other factors including access to the internet the failure of our network or software systems or significant variability in visitor traffic on our product websites earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunication failures computer viruses human error and similar events or disruptions some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities our systems are also subject to intentional acts of vandalism despite any precautions we may take the occurrence of a natural disaster a decision by any of our thirdparty hosting providers to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could cause system interruptions and delays and result in loss of critical data and lengthy interruptions in our services 

we rely on our information systems and those of third parties for activities such as processing customer orders delivery of products hosting and providing services and support to our customers billing and tracking our customers hosting and managing our customer data and otherwise running our business any disruptions or unexpected incompatibilities in our information systems and those of the third parties upon whom we rely could have a significant impact on our business 

an increasing portion of our revenue comes from software as a service solutions and other hosted services in which we store retrieve communicate and manage data which is critical to our customers’ business systems disruption of our systems which support these services and solutions could cause disruptions in our customers’ systems and in the businesses that rely on these systems any such disruptions could harm our reputation create liabilities to our customers hurt demand for our services and solutions and negatively impact our revenues and profitability 

our products are highly technical and may contain undetected errors product defects security vulnerabilities or software errors which could result in damage to our reputation lost revenue diverted development resources and increased service costs warranty claims and litigation 

our products including our software products are highly technical and complex and when deployed may contain errors defects or security vulnerabilities we must develop our products quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing market and we have a history of frequently introducing new products products and services as sophisticated as ours could contain undetected errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new models or versions are released such occurrences could result in damage to our reputation lost revenue diverted development resources increased customer service and support costs warranty claims and litigation 

we warrant that our products will be free of defect for various periods of time depending on the product in addition certain of our contracts include epidemic failure clauses if invoked these clauses may entitle the customer to return or obtain credits for products and inventory or to cancel outstanding purchase orders even if the products themselves are not defective 

errors viruses or bugs may be present in software or hardware that we acquire or license from third parties and incorporate into our products or in third party software or hardware that our customers use in conjunction with our products our customers’ proprietary software and network firewall protections may corrupt data from our products and create difficulties in implementing our solutions changes to third party software or hardware that our customers use in conjunction with our software could also render our applications inoperable any errors defects or security vulnerabilities in our products or any defects in or compatibility issues with any third party hardware or software or customers’ network environments discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition loss of customers theft of trade secrets data or intellectual property and increased service and warranty cost any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products alone or in combination with third party hardware or software could expose them to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses and other malicious software programs that could attack our products actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could harm our reputation and lead some customers to return products to reduce or delay future purchases or use competitive products 

if we are unable to effectively manage our increasingly diverse and complex businesses and operations our ability to generate growth and revenue from new or existing customers may be adversely affected 

because our operations are geographically diverse and increasingly complex our personnel resources and infrastructure could become strained and our reputation in the market and our ability to successfully manage and grow our business may be adversely affected the size complexity and diverse nature of our business and the expansion of our product lines and customer base have placed increased demands on our management and operations and further growth if any may place additional strains on our resources in the future our ability to effectively compete and to manage our planned future growth will depend on among other things the following 

 the company has increasingly diversified the nature of its businesses both organically and by acquisition as a result an increasing amount of our business involves business models which require managerial techniques and skill sets which are different from those required to manage our historical core businesses we are increasingly selling products and solutions directly to large enterprise customers and other end users of our products a direct sales model requires different skills and management processes and procedures from those we have generally used in our business in the past and may create conflicts with our channel partners over the last few years we have been increasing the portion of our business associated with professional services in order to customize our solutions for the needs of individual customers if we are not successful in executing on these new models our sales revenue and financial performance may suffer 

changes in our software and subscription businesses may negatively affect our operating results 

an increasing portion of our revenue is generated through software maintenance and subscription revenue our customers have no obligation to renew their agreements for our software maintenance or subscription services after the expiration of their initial contract period which typically ranges from one to five years our customer acquisition and renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including overall economic conditions the health of their businesses competitive offerings and customer dissatisfaction with our services if customers do not renew their contracts for our products our maintenance and subscription revenue will decline and our financial results will suffer any reduction in the number of licenses that we sell even if our customer acquisition rates do not change will have a negative impact on our future maintenance revenue growth since its introduction our software as a service delivery model has also contributed to subscription revenue if any of our assumptions about expenses revenue or revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect or our attempts to improve efficiency are not successful our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated and our financial results will be negatively impacted 

we continually reevaluate our software licensing programs and subscription renewal programs including specific license models delivery methods and terms and conditions changes to our licensing programs and subscription renewal programs including the timing of the release of enhancements upgrades maintenance releases the term of the contract discounts promotions and other factors could impact the timing of the recognition of revenue for our products related enhancements and services and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition we may implement different licensing models which require the company to recognize licensing fees over a longer period over the last few years we have increasingly offered additional products in a software as a service saas model saas revenues are currently recognized ratably over the subscription period any significant increase in the percentage of our business generated from such a subscription model could increase the amount of revenue to be recognized over time as opposed to upfront which would delay revenue recognition and have a negative impact on our operating results in any quarterly period revenue recognition is complex and will change as we adopt new accounting standard asu no 2014‑09 due to these complexities we may not be able to accurately forecast our nondeferred and deferred revenues which could cause us to miss our earnings estimates or revenue projections and negatively impact our stock price 

we face substantial competition in our markets which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition 

our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price quality and performance of our products the effectiveness of our distribution channel and direct sales force the level of customer service the development of new technology and our ability to participate in emerging markets within each of our markets we encounter direct competition from other gnss software optical and laser suppliers and competition may intensify from various larger us and nonus competitors and new market entrants particularly from emerging markets such as china our products which commonly use gnss for basic location information may be subject to competition from alternative location technologies such as simultaneous location and mapping 

technology  as we sell an increasing amount of software and subscription services we face competition from a group of large well established companies with whom we have not previously competed our integrated hardware and software products may be subject to increasing competition from mass market devices such as smartphones and tablets used in conjunction with relatively inexpensive applications which have not been heavily used for commercial applications in the past these developments may require us to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes that we have not previously been exposed to including those related to cloud computing mobile devices and new computing platforms such competition has in the past resulted and in the future may result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the future against existing and additional competitors will depend largely on our ability to execute our strategy to provide products with significantly differentiated features compared to currently available products we may not be able to implement this strategy successfully and our products may not be competitive with other technologies or products that may be developed by our competitors many of whom have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing sales and other resources than we do 

we are dependent on new products and services and if we are unable to successfully introduce them into the market or to effectively compete with new disruptive product alternatives our customer base may decline or fail to grow as anticipated 

our future revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to bring new products and services to market on a timely basis we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products and services enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance of such products and services we may encounter problems in the future in innovating and introducing new products and services our development stage products may not be successfully completed or if developed may not achieve significant customer acceptance development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and we might not achieve our goals as to the timing of introducing new technology products or could encounter increased costs the timely availability and cost effective production of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success if we are unable to introduce new products and services if other companies develop competing technology products and services or if we do not develop compelling new products and services our number of customers may not grow as anticipated or may decline which could harm our operating results many of our offerings are increasingly focused on software and subscription services the software industry is characterized by rapidly changing customer preferences which require us to address multiple delivery platforms new mobile devices and cloud computing life cycles of software products can be short and this can exacerbate the risks associated with developing new products the introduction of thirdparty solutions embodying new disruptive technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could make our existing and future software solutions and other products obsolete or noncompetitive if we are not able to develop software and other solutions that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers or if we are unable to adapt to new technologies or new industry standards that impact our markets our ability to retain or increase market share and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

some of our products rely on third party technologies including open source software so if integration or incompatibility issues arise with these technologies or these technologies become unavailable our product and services development may be delayed our reputation could be harmed and our business could be adversely affected 

we license software technologies and intellectual property underlying some of our software from third parties the third party licenses we rely upon may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all and the software and technologies may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors resulting in development delays some software licenses are subject to annual renewals at the discretion of the licensors in some cases if we were to breach a provision of these license agreements the licensor could terminate the agreement immediately the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such third party software or technology could result in increased costs or delays in software releases or updates until such issues have been resolved this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and future prospects 

we also incorporate open source software into our products although we monitor our use of open source software the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market or sell our products or to develop new products in such event we could be required to seek licenses from thirdparties in order to continue offering our products to disclose and offer royaltyfree licenses in connection with our own source code to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis any of which could adversely affect our business 

we are dependent on proprietary technology which could result in litigation that could divert significant valuable resources 

our future success and competitive position is dependent upon our proprietary technology and we rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property the patents owned or licensed by us may be invalidated 

circumvented infringed or challenged the rights granted under these patents may not provide competitive advantages to us any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us if at all 

despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain our software or develop software with the same functionality or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology duplicate our technology or design around the patents owned by us in addition effective copyright patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in certain countries the steps taken by us to protect our technology might not prevent the misappropriation of such technology 

the value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many current patent filings thirdparties may claim that we or our customers some of whom are indemnified by us are infringing their intellectual property rights for example individuals and groups may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from us or our customers the number of these claims has increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future as new patents are issued or are brought to our attention by the holders of such patents it may be necessary for us to secure a license from such patent holders redesign our products or withdraw products from the market in addition the legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant expense of operations any such litigation could require us to incur substantial costs and divert significant valuable resources including the efforts of our technical and management personnel which could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

our global operations expose us to risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally and our results of operations may be adversely affected by our efforts to comply with the laws of other countries as well as us laws which apply to international operations such as the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and us export control laws 

we operate on a global basis with offices or activities in europe africa asia south america australasia and north america we face risks inherent in conducting business internationally including compliance with international and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations these laws and regulations include data privacy requirements labor relations laws tax laws anticompetition regulations import and trade restrictions export control laws and laws which prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers including the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the uk bribery act or other anticorruption laws that have recently been the subject of a substantial increase in global enforcement many of our products are subject to us export law restrictions that limit the destinations and types of customers to which our products may be sold or require an export license in connection with sales outside the united states given the high level of complexity of these laws there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently or intentionally breached for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise also we may be held liable for actions taken by our local dealers and partners violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees and prohibitions or conditions on the conduct of our business any such violations could include prohibitions or conditions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our operating results 

in addition we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced significant governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices we may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence or through other methods that relevant law and regulations prohibit us from using our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties 

in addition to the foregoing engaging in international business inherently involves a number of other difficulties and risks including 

 

these factors or any combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue or our overall financial performance 

changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income in future periods 

as a global company we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities our effective tax rate is largely based on the geographic mix of earnings statutory rates intercompany transfer pricing and enacted tax laws a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates including 

 on october 5 2015 the oecd released the final reports from its beps action plans the beps recommendations covered a number of issues including countrybycountry reporting permanent establishment rules transfer pricing rules and tax treaties these changes which have been or are in the process of being adopted by numerous countries could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes if our effective tax rates were to increase our operating results cash flows or financial condition could be adversely affected 

in january 2016 the ec announced an antitax avoidance package containing measures to regulate certain elements of tax planning further and to boost tax transparency for consideration by the european parliament and council meanwhile in the us a number of proposals for broad reform of the corporate tax system are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies future tax reform resulting from these developments may result in changes to longstanding tax principles which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities it is not possible to accurately determine the overall impact of such proposals on our effective tax rate at this time 

we are currently in various stages of multiple year examinations by federal state and foreign taxing authorities including a review of our 2010 to 2012 tax years by the us internal revenue service or irs if the irs or the taxing authorities of any other jurisdiction were to successfully challenge a material tax position we could become subject to higher taxes and our earnings would be adversely affected 

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us 

generally accepted accounting principles in the us are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board or fasb the sec and other bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles for example in may 2014 the fasb issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that replaces the current revenue recognition guidance under us gaap this standard establishes a principle for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services the standard also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining and fulfilling customer contracts we expect to adopt this accounting standard update in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or modified retrospective approach for the adoption of the standard we are still evaluating which adoption method we will apply and are continuing to assess the impact that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures this new standard is both technical and complex and we expect to incur significant ongoing costs to implement and maintain compliance with this new standard in addition there may be greater uncertainty with respect to projecting revenue results from future operations as we work through the new revenue recognition standard the new standard may impact the timing and amounts of revenue recognized adoption of the new revenue recognition standard along with any other changes in accounting principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change any difficulties in the implementation of new or changed accounting standards could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations if our estimates relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions or judgments that change or prove to be incorrect our operating results could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price 

we are dependent on a specific manufacturer and assembler for many of our products and on other manufacturers and specific suppliers of critical parts for our products 

we are substantially dependent upon flextronics international limited as our preferred manufacturing partner for many of our gnss products under our agreement with flextronics we provide a twelvemonth product forecast and place purchase orders with flextronics at least thirty calendar days in advance of the scheduled delivery of products to our customers depending on production lead time although purchase orders placed with flextronics are cancelable the terms of the agreement would require us to purchase from flextronics all inventory not returnable or usable by other flextronics customers accordingly if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products we may be unable to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity from flextronics to meet customers’ delivery requirements or we may accumulate excess inventories if such inventories are not usable by other flextronics customers our current contract with flextronics continues in effect until either party gives the other ninety days written notice 

we rely on specific suppliers for a number of our critical components and on other contract manufacturers including benchmark electronics and jabil for the manufacture test and assembly of certain products and components we have experienced shortages of components in the past our current reliance on specific or a limited group of suppliers and contract manufacturers involves risks including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components reduced control over pricing and delivery schedules discontinuation of or increased prices for certain components and economic conditions which may adversely impact the viability of our suppliers and contract manufacturers this situation may be exacerbated during any period of economic recovery or a competitive environment any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture assemble and test such components internally could significantly delay our ability to ship our products which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our reputation and brand as well as our operating results 

we are dependent on the availability and unimpaired use of allocated bands within the radio frequency spectrum and our products may be subject to harmful interference from new or modified spectrum uses 

our gnss technology is dependent on the use of satellite signals and on terrestrial communication bands international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union itu a specialized technical agency of the united nations these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference each country also has regulatory authority over how each band is used in the country in the united states the federal communications commission fcc and the national telecommunications and information administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations 

any itu or local reallocation of radio frequency bands including frequency band segmentation and sharing of spectrum or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our customers both of which could reduce demand for our products for example the fcc has been considering proposals to repurpose spectrum adjacent to the gps bands for terrestrial broadband wireless operations throughout the united states if the fcc were to permit implementation of such proposals or similar proposals terrestrial broadband wireless operations could create harmful interference to gps receivers within range of such operations and impose costs to retrofit or replace affected receivers similarly other countries have considered proposals for use of frequencies used by our products as well as adjacent bands that could cause harmful interference to our products 

many of our products use other radio frequency bands such as the public land mobile radio bands together with the gnss signal to provide enhanced gnss capabilities such as realtime kinematics precision the continuing availability of these nongnss radio frequencies is essential to provide enhanced gnss products to our precision survey agriculture and construction machine controls markets in addition transmissions and emissions from other services and equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or inband may impair the utility and reliability of our products any regulatory changes in spectrum allocation or in allowable operating conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

many of our products rely on gnss technology gps and other satellite systems which may become degraded or inoperable and result in lost revenue 

gnss technology gps satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible intentional disruption many of the gps satellites currently in orbit were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of 31 operational satellites in orbit six have been in operation for more than 15 years and over half have been in use for more than 75 years repair of damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites a reduction in the number of operating satellites below the 24satellite standard established for gps may impair the utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities in addition software updates to gps satellites and ground control segments can cause problems and we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of such updates to mitigate these problems 

we are dependent on continued operation of gps the principal gnss currently in operation the gps constellation is operated by the u s government which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps if supporting policies were to change or if user fees were imposed it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

many of our products also use signals from systems that augment gps such as the wide area augmentation system and national differential gps system and satellites transmitting signal corrections data on mobile satellite services frequencies utilized by our rtx corrections services some of these augmentation systems are operated by the us government and rely on continued funding and maintenance of these systems any curtailment of the operating capability of these systems or limitations on access to or use of the signals or discontinuance of service could result in degradation of our services or product performance with an adverse effect on our business 

many of our products use satellite signals from the russian glonass system other countries including china and india are in the process of creating their own gnss systems and we either have developed or will develop products which use gnss signals from these systems the european community is developing an independent radio navigation satellite system known as galileo national or european authorities may provide preferential access to signals to companies associated with their markets including our competitors which could harm our competitive position use of nonus gnss signals may also be subject to fcc waiver requirements and to restrictions based upon international trade or geopolitical considerations if we are unable to develop timely and competitive commercial products using these systems or obtain timely and equal access to service signals this could result in lost revenue these authorities may also adopt protectionist measures favoring national companies who make use of their gnss systems to the detriment of trimble products using the us gps system which would harm our business 

we are subject to the impact of governmental and other similar certifications processes and regulations which could adversely affect our products and our business 

we market certain products that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold for example ce certification is required for gnss receivers and data communications products conforming to the european harmonized gnss receiver standard and the radio equipment directive to be sold in the european community delays in publication of the european harmonized gnss receiver standard could affect gnss product access to european markets in the future us governmental authorities may propose gps receiver testing and certification for compliance with published gps signal interface or other specifications an inability to obtain any such certifications in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our operating results governmental authorities may also propose other forms of gps receiver performance standards which may limit design alternatives hamper product innovation or impose additional costs some of our products that use integrated radio communication technology require product type certification and some products require an enduser to obtain licensing from the fcc for frequencyband usage these are secondary licenses that are subject to certain restrictions an inability or delay in obtaining such certifications or changes to the rules by the fcc could adversely affect our ability to bring our products to market which could harm our customer relationships and therefore our operating results any failure to obtain the requisite certifications could also harm our operating results 

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes 

we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes can be difficult to predict management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability or may suffer unforeseen liabilities which could then impact the results of a financial period a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable which if not expected could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

our debt could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations 

on november 24 2014 we issued senior notes notes due december 1 2024 in an aggregate principal amount of 4000 million the notes accrue interest at a rate of 475 per annum payable semiannually in arrears on december 1 and june 1 of each year beginning on june 1 2015 when the notes mature we will have to expend significant resources to repay these notes or seek to refinance them if we decide to refinance the notes we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the notes at all both of which may adversely affect our financial condition 

on november 24 2014 we entered into a new fiveyear credit agreement with a group of lenders the 2014 credit facility the 2014 credit facility provides for an unsecured revolving loan facility of 10 billion subject to the terms of the 2014 credit facility the revolving loan facility may be increased and term loan facilities may be established in an amount of up to 5000 million we also have two 75 million revolving credit facilities which are uncommitted and may be called by the lenders with very little notice the uncommitted facilities at the end of fiscal 2016 our total debt was comprised primarily of notes of 

4000 million a revolving loan balance of 940 million  under the 2014 credit facility and a revolving credit line balance of 1300 million  under the uncommitted facilities 

our outstanding indebtedness could have important consequences such as 

 there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and we may not be able to repay the indebtedness that becomes due a default under our debt instruments may also significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control a significant portion of our outstanding debt has interest rates which float based on prevailing interest rates if interest rates increase our interest expense will also increase 

our ability to incur additional indebtedness over time may be limited due to applicable financial covenants and restrictions and due to the risk that significantly increasing our level of indebtedness could impact the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations which in turn would increase the interest rates and fees that we pay in connection with our indebtedness 

our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war terrorism or civil unrest 

acts of war acts of terrorism or civil unrest especially any events that impact the gnss signals or systems could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military activity in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism or hostilities may involve a redeployment of the satellites used in gnss or interruptions of the system civil unrest local conflicts or other political instability may adversely impact regional economies cause work stoppages or result in limitations on business transactions with the affected foreign jurisdictions to the extent that such interruptions result in delays or the cancellation of orders disruption of the manufacturing or shipment of our products or reduced demand for our products it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that reflect our plans estimates and beliefs our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and those listed under “risks factors” 

executive level overview 

trimble inc is a leading provider of technology solutions that optimize the work processes of office and mobile field professionals around the world our comprehensive work process solutions are used across a range of industries including agriculture architecture civil engineering construction government natural resources transportation and utilities representative trimble customers include engineering and construction firms contractors surveying companies farmers and agricultural companies transportation and logistics companies energy mining and utility companies and state federal and municipal governments 

trimble focuses on integrating its broad technological and application capabilities to create verticallyfocused systemlevel solutions that transform how work is done within the industries we serve the integration of sensors software connectivity and information in our portfolio gives us the unique ability to provide an information model specific to the customer’s workflow for example in construction our strategy is centered on the concept of a “constructible model” which is at the center of our “connected construction site” solutions which provide realtime connected and cohesive information environments for the design build and operational phases of projects in agriculture we continue to develop “connected farm” solutions to optimize operations across the agriculture workflow in transportation and logistics our “connected fleet” solutions provide transportation companies with tools to enhance fuel efficiency safety and transparency through connected vehicles and fleets across the enterprise 

our growth strategy is centered on multiple elements 

 

trimble’s focus on these growth drivers has led over time to growth in revenue and profitability as well as an increasingly diversified business model software and services growth is driving increased recurring revenue leading to improved visibility in some of our businesses as our solutions have expanded our go to market model has also evolved with a balanced mix between direct distribution and oem customers and an increasing number of enterprise level customer relationships 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs of sales operating expenses and related disclosures we consider the accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting policies these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies our accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 of our accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer or is uncertain revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 

contracts andor customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement shipping documents and customer acceptance when applicable are used to verify delivery we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analyses as well as the customer’s payment history 

revenue for orders is not recognized until the product is shipped and title has transferred to the buyer we bear all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods up to that point our shipment terms for us orders and international orders fulfilled from our european distribution center typically provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the carrier named by the buyer at the named place or point if no precise point is indicated by the buyer delivery is deemed to occur when the carrier takes the goods into its charge from the place determined by us other shipment terms may provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the buyer shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 

revenue from sales to distributors and dealers is recognized upon shipment assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met distributors and dealers do not have a right of return 

revenue from purchased extended warranty and post contract support pcs agreements is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the warranty or support period revenue from our subscription services related to our hardware and applications is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription service period beginning on the date that service is made available to the customer assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been met 

we present revenue net of sales taxes and any similar assessments 

our software arrangements generally consist of a perpetual license fee and pcs we generally have established vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for our pcs contracts based on the renewal rate the remaining value of the software arrangement is allocated to the license fee using the residual method license revenue is primarily recognized when the software has been delivered and fair value has been established for all remaining undelivered elements in cases where vsoe of fair value for pcs is not established revenue is recognized ratably over the pcs period after all software deliverables have been made and the only the undelivered element is pcs 

for services performed on a fixedfee basis revenue is recognized using the proportional performance method with performance measured based on hours of work performed for contracts that involve significant customization and implementation or consulting services that are essential to the functionality of the software the license and services revenues are recognized using the percentageofcompletion method or if we are unable to reliably estimate the costs to complete the services we use the completedcontract method of accounting a contract is considered complete when all significant costs have been incurred or when acceptance from the customer has been received 

some of our subscription product offerings include hardware subscription services and extended warranty under these hosted arrangements the customer typically does not have the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the 

hosting period without incurring a significant penalty and it is not feasible for the customer to run the software either on its own hardware or on a thirdparty’s hardware 

our multiple deliverable product offerings include hardware with embedded firmware extended warranty software pcs services and subscription services which are considered separate units of accounting for certain of our products software and nonsoftware components function together to deliver the tangible product’s essential functionality 

in evaluating the revenue recognition for our hardware or subscription agreements which contain multiple deliverables we determined that in certain instances we were not able to establish vsoe for some or all deliverables in an arrangement as we infrequently sold each element on a standalone basis did not price products within a narrow range or had a limited sales history when vsoe cannot be established we attempt to establish the selling price of each element based on relevant thirdparty evidence tpe tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately our offerings may contain a significant level of proprietary technology customization or differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained furthermore we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products’ selling prices are on a standalone basis therefore we typically are not able to establish the selling price of an element based on tpe 

when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe we use our best estimate of selling price besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis besp is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a standalone basis or for new or highly customized offerings we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including but not limited to pricing practices market conditions competitive landscape internal costs geographies and gross margin the determination of besp is made through consultation with and formal approval by our management taking into consideration our gotomarket strategy 

income taxes 

we are a united statesbased multinational company operating in multiple us and foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual tax audit outcomes determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment changes in recognition or measurement of our uncertain tax positions would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

we are subject to the periodic examination of our domestic and foreign tax returns by the irs state local and foreign tax authorities who may challenge our tax positions we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 

our income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the us federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to the changes in nondeductible expenses changes in the geographic mix of pretax income and changes related to acquisitions and divestitures unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities the united states and foreign countries where we do business may change tax laws regulations and interpretations and these potential changes could adversely affect our effective tax rates 

business combinations and valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree based on their fair values at the acquisition date the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill 

when determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to expected future cash flows which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins customer attrition rates future changes in technology and brand awareness loyalty and position and discount rates fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability identifiable intangible assets are comprised of distribution channels and distribution rights patents licenses technology acquired backlog trademarks and inprocess research and development amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available 

we evaluate goodwill at a minimum on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year based on the values on the first day of that quarter goodwill was reviewed for impairment utilizing a quantitative twostep process when we perform a quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment the determination of fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions the discounted cash flows are based upon among other things assumptions about expected future operating performance using riskadjusted discount rates actual future results may differ from those estimates 

identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straightline method approximates the pattern of economic benefits associated with these assets changes in circumstances such as technological advances changes to our business model or changes in the capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives of intangible assets differing from initial estimates in cases where we determine that the useful life of an asset should be revised the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value will be depreciated over its revised remaining useful life these assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable based on their future cash flows the estimated future cash flows are based upon among other things assumptions about expected future operating performance and these estimates may differ from actual future cash flows the assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value 

stockbased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to our employees and directors based on estimated fair values net of estimated forfeitures the awards include restricted stock units with servicebased marketbased and performancebased vesting conditions rights to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plan and stock options 

the fair value of our servicebased and performancebased restricted stock units is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant and the total expense associated with the performancebased awards is based upon the expected achievement of the underlying performance goals and may be adjusted in future periods based upon changes in expectations and actual achievement the fair value of restricted stock units with marketbased vesting conditions is valued as of the grant date using a monte carlo simulation the fair value of rights to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plan is estimated using the blackscholes optionpricing model and the fair value of our options is estimated using a binomial valuation model 

the determination of fair value of sharebased payment awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors riskfree interest rates and any expected dividends in addition the binomial model incorporates actual optionpricing behavior and changes in volatility over the option’s contractual term the monte carlo simulation takes into account the same input assumptions as the binomial option pricing model as outlined above however it also incorporates into the fairvalue determination the possibility that the marketbased vesting conditions may not be satisfied and the impact of the possible differing stock price paths for trimble and each of the constituents of the sp 500 if factors change and we employ different assumptions to determine the fair value of our sharebased payment awards granted in future periods the compensation expense that we record under it may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 

stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest including the achievement of performancebased goals and estimated forfeitures if the performance goals achieved are different from what had been estimated or actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimates stockbased compensation recognized may not be reflective of what was earned in that period 

inventory valuation 

our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market which approximates net realizable value adjustments are also made to reduce the cost of inventory for estimated excess or obsolete balances factors influencing these adjustments include declines in demand which impact inventory purchasing forecasts technological changes product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues if our estimates used to reserve for excess and obsolete inventory are different from what we expected we may be required to recognize additional reserves which would negatively impact our gross margin 

results of operations 

overview 

the following table is a summary of revenue gross margin and operating income for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

  



basis of presentation 

we have a 5253 week fiscal year ending on the friday nearest to december 31 which for fiscal 2016  was december 30 2016  fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  were all 52week years 

revenue 

in fiscal 2016  total revenue increased  by 718 million  or 3  to 236 billion  from 229 billion  in fiscal 2015  overall revenue was primarily impacted by organic growth in building construction civil engineering and construction and transportation and logistics partially offset by declines in geospatial and gis we consider organic growth to include all revenue except for revenue associated with acquisitions made within the last four quarters 

on a segment basis the increase in fiscal 2016  was primarily due to engineering and construction and mobile solutions to a lesser extent advanced devices partially offset by slight declines in field solutions engineering and construction revenue increased 303 million  or 2  mobile solutions revenue increased 394 million  or 8  advanced devices increased 31 million  or 2  partially offset by a slight decrease in field solutions revenue of 10 million  or less than 1 as compared to fiscal 2015  engineering and construction revenue increased driven by building construction and civil engineering and construction partially offset by declines in geospatial field solutions revenue was down due to softness in gis markets mobile solutions revenue increased due to continued growth in the transportation and logistics market advanced devices revenue increased primarily due to strong oem and end user sales 

by revenue category overall product revenue increased   285 million  or 2  service revenue increased   103 million  or 2  and subscription revenue increased   330 million  or 10  the product revenue increase was primarily within engineering and construction and mobile solutions to a lesser extent advanced devices partially offset by declines in field solutions service and subscription increases were primarily due to organic growth within engineering and construction and mobile solutions as we continue to expand software and services including implementation maintenance and subscription services as a portion of our revenue although to a lesser extent acquisition growth within field solutions also contributed 

in fiscal 2015  total revenue decreased by 1051 million  or 4  to 229 billion  from 240 billion  in fiscal 2014  overall revenue was primarily impacted by negative foreign currency effects and to a lesser extent declines due to oil and gas and agricultural market conditions partially offset by acquisitions and improved growth in building construction and transportation and logistics 

on a segment basis the decrease in fiscal 2015  was primarily due to engineering and construction and field solutions partially offset by the increase in mobile solutions engineering and construction revenue decreased 648 million  or 5  field solutions revenue decreased 668 million  or 16  and advanced devices decreased 70 million  or 5  partially offset by an increase in mobile solutions of 335 million  or 7  as compared to fiscal 2014  the decline in engineering and construction was primarily driven by the impact of foreign currency effects due to the weaker euro and to a lesser extent oil price declines on regional economies primarily in geospatial the decline was partially offset by building construction which was up due to organic growth and to a lesser extent acquisitions not applicable in the prior year the decline in field solutions revenue was primarily due to softness in agricultural markets and to a lesser extent gis and foreign currency effects mobile solutions revenue increased due 

to continued growth in the transportation and logistics market advanced devices revenue decreased primarily due to weaker sales of timing component products 

by revenue category overall product revenue decreased   1801 million  or 11  service revenue increased   239 million  or 6  and subscription revenue increased   511 million  or 18  the product revenue decrease was primarily within engineering and construction and field solutions slightly offset by a product revenue increase in mobile solutions service and subscription increases were primarily due to organic growth within engineering and construction and mobile solutions as we continue to expand software and services including implementation and maintenance and subscription services as a portion of our revenue although to a lesser extent acquisitions growth within engineering and construction also contributed 

during fiscal 2016  sales to customers in the united states represented 49 europe represented 24 asia pacific represented 15 and other regions represented 12 of our total revenue during fiscal 2015  sales to customers in the united states represented 50 europe represented 24 asia pacific represented 14 and other regions represented 12 of our total revenue during fiscal 2014  sales to customers in the united states represented 48 europe represented 24 asia pacific represented 14 and other regions represented 14 of our total revenue we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue 

no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenue in fiscal 2016  2015  or 2014  no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our accounts receivable as of fiscal years ended 2016  and 2015  

gross margin 

our gross margin varies due to a number of factors including product mix pricing distribution channel production volumes new product startup costs and foreign currency translations 

in fiscal 2016  our gross margin increased  by 358 million  as compared to fiscal 2015  primarily due to increased revenue in engineering and construction and mobile solutions gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 524  in fiscal 2016  and 525  in fiscal 2015  the slight decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily in engineering and construction and mobile solutions due to product mix partially offset by lower intangible asset amortization 

in fiscal 2015  our gross margin decreased  by 886 million  as compared to fiscal 2014  primarily due to decreased revenue in engineering and construction and field solutions gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 525  in fiscal 2015  and 539  in fiscal 2014  the decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily in engineering and construction due to product mix and foreign currency effects due to the weaker euro and to a lesser extent due to an increase in intangible asset amortization 

operating income 

operating income increased  by  266 million  for fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  operating income as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2016  was 77  as compared to 67  for fiscal 2015  the increase in operating income and operating income percentage was primarily due to revenue expansion in engineering and construction and mobile solutions the effects of strong operating expense control across the company and lower intangible asset amortization 

operating income decreased  by 1064 million  for fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  operating income as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2015  was 67  as compared to 109  for fiscal 2014  the decrease in operating income and operating income percentage was primarily due to revenue declines in engineering and construction and field solutions and increased restructuring partially offset by the effects of operating expense control also higher revenue in mobile solutions partially offset the declines 

results by segment 

to achieve distribution marketing production and technology advantages in our targeted markets we manage our operations in the following four segments engineering and construction field solutions mobile solutions and advanced devices segment operating income equals net revenue less cost of sales and operating expense excluding general corporate expense amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisition costs and restructuring charges

negative foreign currency effects due to the weaker euro and to a lesser extent the impact of oil and gas markets on regional economies which impacted sales primarily in geospatial the decline was partially offset by building construction which was up due to organic growth and acquisitions not applicable in the prior year 

segment operating income decreased primarily due to decreased revenue and lower gross margin resulting from product mix and foreign currency effects due to the weaker euro slightly offset by the effects of operating expense control although acquisitions contributed to revenue they also presented a short term negative impact on revenue and operating income partly because of deferred revenue accounting effects

mobile solutions revenue increased  by 335 million  or 7  while segment operating income increased  by 76 million  or 10  for fiscal year 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  the revenue increase was primarily due to continued organic growth in the transportation and logistics market which focuses on enterprise solutions this was partially offset by a decline in field services and negative foreign currency effects due to the weaker euro segment operating income increased due to increased revenue and product mix 

advanced devices 

advanced devices revenue increased  by 31 million  or 2  and segment operating income increased  by 45 million  or 10  for fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  revenue and operating income increased primarily due to strong oem and end user sales operating income increased due to increased revenue and product mix as well as operating expense control

the following table shows nonoperating income net for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

  

total nonoperating income expense net decreased  by 17 million  during fiscal 2016  compared with fiscal 2015  the decrease was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency transaction fluctuations partially offset by deferred compensation gains included in other income net

income tax provision 

our effective income tax rates for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  were 25 20 and 20 respectively the fiscal 2016 rate was less than the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the geographic mix of pretax income a divestiture of a nonstrategic business and the us federal rd credit the fiscal 2015 rate was less than the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the geographical mix of our pretax income and to a lesser extent the inclusion of the current year us federal rd credit the fiscal 2014 rate was less than the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the geographical mix of our pretax income and to a lesser extent the inclusion of the current year us federal rd credit partially offset by the effect of a gain on a partial equity sale of vss 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than operating leases inventory purchases and other commitments incurred in the normal course of business see contractual obligations table below we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities guarantee contracts retained or contingent interests in transferred assets or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity we do not have any majorityowned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements additionally we do not have any interest in or relationship with any special purpose entities 

in the normal course of business to facilitate sales of our products we indemnify other parties including customers lessors and parties to other transactions with us with respect to certain matters we have agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties these agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim from time to time in connection with divesting some of our businesses or assets we may also indemnify purchasers for certain matters in the normal course of business such as breaches of representations covenants or excluded liabilities in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents 

it is not possible to determine the maximum potential exposure under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under these agreements have not been material and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on the consolidated balance sheets at the end of fiscal 2016 and 2015 

liquidity and capital resources 

  



cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

at the end of fiscal 2016  cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 3272 million  compared to 1160 million  at the end of fiscal 2015  we had a principal balance of outstanding debt of 6248 million  at the end of fiscal 2016  compared to 7352 million  at the end of fiscal 2015  

our ability to continue to generate cash from operations will depend in large part on profitability the rate of collections of accounts receivable our inventory turns and our ability to manage other areas of working capital 

our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are maintained with several financial institutions deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions considered to be of reputable credit and to present little credit risk our investment policy requires the portfolio to include only securities with high credit quality and a weighted average maturity not to exceed 6 months with the main objective of preserving capital and maintaining liquidity we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities we classify our investments as shortterm investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations we believe that our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and borrowings under our 2014 credit facility as described below under the heading “debt” will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs debt service planned capital expenditures acquisitions and stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program for at least the next twelve months 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 4071 million  for fiscal 2016  as compared to 3549 million  for fiscal 2015  the increase  of 522 million  was due to an increase in net income before noncash depreciation and amortization primarily due to increased operating income in engineering and construction and mobile solutions to a lesser extent advanced devices also due to a decrease in working capital requirements due to inventory improvements 

cash provided by operating activities was 3549 million  for fiscal 2015  as compared to 4071 million  for fiscal 2014  the decrease  of 522 million  was due to a decrease in net income before noncash depreciation and amortization primarily due to decreased operating income in engineering and construction and to a lesser extent field solutions this was partially offset by a decrease in working capital requirements due to inventory improvements 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 1444 million  for fiscal 2016  as compared to 1724 million  for fiscal 2015  the decrease of cash used in investing activities is primarily due to less cash used for business and intangible asset acquisitions partially offset by the purchase of shortterm investments fiscal 2016 acquisitions included building data and sefaira and other acquisitions fiscal 2015 acquisitions included pocketmobile and vianova systems and other acquisitions 

cash used in investing activities was 1724 million  for fiscal 2015  as compared to 3440 million  for fiscal 2014  the decrease is primarily due to cash used for business and intangible asset acquisitions fiscal 2015 acquisitions included pocketmobile and vianova systems and other acquisitions fiscal 2014 acquisitions included manhattan software amtech and other acquisitions 

financing activities 

cash used by financing activities was 1558 million  for fiscal 2016  as compared to cash used of 2028 million  during fiscal 2015  the decrease of cash used by financing activities of 470 million  was primarily due to a decrease in cash used for stock repurchases partially offset by payments on revolving credit facilities 

cash used by financing activities was 2028 million  for fiscal 2015  as compared to cash used of 515 million  during fiscal 2014  the increase of 1513 million  was primarily due to an increase in cash used for stock repurchases 

accounts receivable and inventory metrics 

  

accounts receivable days sales outstanding were down at 55  days at the end of fiscal 2016  as compared to 59  days at the end of fiscal 2015  due to improved collections our accounts receivable days sales outstanding are calculated based on ending accounts receivable net divided by revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter times a quarterly average of 91 days our inventory turns were 48  at the end of fiscal 2016  as compared to 40  at the end of fiscal 2015  due to improved inventory management our inventory turnover is based on the total cost of sales for the fiscal period over the average inventory for the corresponding fiscal period although favorable over the prior year accounts receivable days sales outstanding and inventory turns are subject to a variety of business factors and these favorable trends may not continue in the future 

debt 

notes 

on october 30 2014 we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission “sec” for the issuance of senior debt securities on november 24 2014 we issued 4000 million of senior notes “notes” under the shelf registration statement the notes mature on december 1 2024 and accrue interest at a rate of 475 per annum payable semiannually in arrears on december 1 and june 1 of each year beginning on june 1 2015 the notes are classified as longterm in the consolidated balance sheet 

prior to september 1 2024 we may redeem the notes at our option at any time in whole or in part at a redemption price equal to the greater of i 100  of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed and ii the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of interest and principal calculated on a semiannual basis using a discount rate equal to the us treasury rate plus 40 basis points after september 1 2024 we may redeem the notes at our option at any time in whole or in part at a redemption price equal to 100  of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon in addition in the event of a change of control as defined in the prospectus filed with the sec each 

holder of the notes will have the right to require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of such holder’s notes at a purchase price equal to 101  of the principal amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest

2014 credit facility 

on november 24 2014 we entered into a new fiveyear credit agreement with a group of lenders the “2014 credit facility” which replaced our previous 2012 credit facility the 2014 credit facility provides for an unsecured revolving loan facility of 10 billion subject to the terms of the 2014 credit facility the revolving loan facility may be increased andor term loan facilities may be established in an amount up to 5000 million the outstanding balance of 940 million  is classified as longterm in the consolidated balance sheet 

the funds available under the 2014 credit facility may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes stock repurchases and the financing of certain acquisitions under the 2014 credit facility we may borrow repay and reborrow funds under the revolving loan facility until its maturity on november 24 2019 at which time the revolving facility will terminate and all outstanding loans together with all accrued and unpaid interest must be repaid amounts not borrowed under the 10 billion revolving facility will be subject to a commitment fee to be paid in arrears on the last day of each fiscal quarter ranging from 010 to 030 per annum depending on either our credit rating at such time or our leverage ratio as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter whichever results in more favorable pricing to us 

we may borrow funds under the 2014 credit facility in us dollars euros or in certain other agreed currencies and borrowings will bear interest at our option at either i a floating per annum base rate determined by reference to the highest of a the administrative agent’s prime rate b 050 per annum above the federal funds effective rate and c reserveadjusted libor for an interest period of one month plus 100 plus a margin of between 000 and 075 or ii a reserveadjusted fixed per annum rate based on libor or euribor depending on the currency borrowed plus a margin of between 100 and 175 the applicable margin in each case is determined based on either trimble’s credit rating at such time or trimble’s leverage ratio as of its most recently ended fiscal quarter whichever results in more favorable pricing to us interest is payable on the last day of each fiscal quarter with respect to borrowings bearing interest at the base rate or on the last day of an interest period but at least every three months with respect to borrowings bearing interest at libor or euribor rate 

the 2014 credit facility contains various customary representations and warranties by us which include customary use of materiality material adverse effect and knowledge qualifiers the 2014 credit facility also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including among other requirements negative covenants that restrict our ability to create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions and that restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to incur indebtedness further the 2014 credit facility contains financial covenants that require the maintenance of minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios specifically we must maintain as of the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of a ebitda as defined in the 2014 credit facility to b interest expense for the most recently ended period of four fiscal quarters of not less than 350 to 100 we must also maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of x total indebtedness as defined in the 2014 credit facility to y ebitda as defined in the 2014 credit facility for the most recently ended period of four fiscal quarters of not greater than 300 to 100 provided that on the completion of a material acquisition we may increase the ratio by 050 for the fiscal quarter during which such acquisition occurred and each of the three subsequent fiscal quarters we were in compliance with these covenants at the end of fiscal 2016  

the 2014 credit facility contains events of default that include among others nonpayment of principal interest or fees breach of covenants inaccuracy of representations and warranties cross defaults to certain other indebtedness bankruptcy and insolvency events material judgments and events constituting a change of control upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default interest on the obligations will accrue at an increased rate and the lenders may accelerate our obligations under the 2014 credit facility except that acceleration will be automatic in the case of bankruptcy and insolvency events of default 

in february 2016 we entered into an amendment to the 2014 credit facility to facilitate the reincorporation from california to delaware and to effect other nonfinancial terms in august 2016 we entered into a second amendment to revise a definition used in determining when a change of control of the company may occur 

the interest rate on the longterm debt outstanding under the credit facilities was 180  and 146  at the end of fiscal 2016  and 2015  respectively 

uncommitted facilities 

we also have two 75 million revolving credit facilities which are uncommitted the “uncommitted facilities” the uncommitted facilities may be called by the lenders at any time have no covenants and no specified expiration date the interest rate on the uncommitted facilities is 100  plus either libor or the bank’s cost of funds or as otherwise agreed upon by the bank and us the 1300 million  outstanding at the end of 2016  and the 1180 million  outstanding at the end of 2015  under the uncommitted facilities are classified as shortterm in our consolidated balance sheet the weighted average interest rate on the uncommitted facilities was 165  at the end of fiscal 2016  and 137  at the end of fiscal 2015  

for additional discussion of our debt see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

repatriation of foreign earnings and income taxes 

at the end of fiscal 2016 3101 million of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment was held by our foreign subsidiaries of which 59 million was borrowed from the us under intercompany financing arrangements if these loaned funds are needed for our operations in the us we would not be required to accrue and pay us federal and state taxes to repatriate the loaned funds to the extent of other repatriation of cash held by foreign subsidiaries we generally would be required to pay us federal and state taxes while a significant portion of our foreign earnings continue to be permanently reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries it is anticipated this reinvestment will not impede cash needs at the parent company level however if we were to make significant acquisitions or stock repurchases we may be required to increase our outstanding indebtedness which could result in increased borrowing costs in our determination of which foreign earnings are permanently reinvested we consider numerous factors including the financial requirements of the us parent company the financial requirements of the foreign subsidiaries and the tax consequences of remitting the foreign earnings back to the us there are no other material impediments to our ability to access sources of liquidity and our resulting ability to meet short and longterm liquidity needs other than in the event we are not in compliance with the covenants under our 2014 credit facility or the potential tax costs of remitting foreign earnings back to the us 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at the end of fiscal 2016  

  



  

 at the end of fiscal 2016  we had unrecognized tax benefits included in other noncurrent liabilities of 653 million  including interest and penalties at this time we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with tax authorities regarding this liability and therefore such amounts are not included in the contractual obligations table above 

effect of new accounting pronouncements 

the impact of recent accounting pronouncements is disclosed in note 2 of our accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

reconciliation of gaap to nongaap financial measures 

our nongaap measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap measures the nongaap financial measures included in the following tables as well as detailed explanations to the adjustments to comparable gaap measures are set forth below 

nongaap gross margin 

we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap gross margin as a way of understanding how product mix pricing decisions and manufacturing costs influence our business nongaap gross margin excludes restructuring charges amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation and amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup from gaap gross margin we believe that these exclusions offer investors additional information that may be useful to view trends in our gross margin performance 

nongaap operating expenses 

we believe this measure is important to investors evaluating our nongaap spending in relation to revenue nongaap operating expenses exclude restructuring charges amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation acquisitiondivestiture costs associated with external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition activities such as legal due diligence integration costs executive transition costs and litigation expense from gaap operating expenses we believe that these exclusions offer investors supplemental information to facilitate comparison of our operating expenses to our prior results 

nongaap operating income 

we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap operating income trends which are driven by revenue gross margin and spending nongaap operating income excludes restructuring charges amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisitiondivestiture costs associated with external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition activities such as legal due diligence integration costs executive transition costs and litigation expenses we believe that these exclusions offer an alternative means for our investors to evaluate current operating performance compared to results of other periods 

nongaap nonoperating income expense net 

we believe this measure helps investors evaluate our nonoperating income trends nongaap nonoperating income expense net excludes acquisition and divestiture gainslosses associated with unusual acquisition related items such as intangible asset impairment charges and gains or losses related to the acquisition or sale of certain businesses and investments and an equity sale gain these gainslosses are specific to particular acquisitions and divestitures and vary significantly in amount and timing nongaap nonoperating income expense net also excludes the writeoff of debt issuance costs associated with terminated andor modified credit facilities and costs associated with the issuance of new credit facilities and senior notes that were not capitalized as debt issuance costs we believe that these exclusions provide investors with a supplemental view of our ongoing financial results 

nongaap income tax provision 

we believe that providing investors with the nongaap income tax provision is beneficial because it provides for consistent treatment of the excluded items in our nongaap presentation in fiscal 2015 we began calculating a nongaap tax rate separate from the gaap rate as we expect this to add consistency in the nongaap trends the nongaap income tax provision excludes material nonrecurring items such as build and release of valuation allowances reserve releases related to closure of tax audits and other nonrecurring items we have not retroactively restated prior periods’ nongaap results with a similar separate rate therefore comparability between periods may be affected 

nongaap net income 

this measure provides a supplemental view of net income trends which are driven by nongaap income before taxes and our nongaap tax rate nongaap net income excludes restructuring charges amortization of purchased intangible assets stock 

based compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisitiondivestiture costs executive transition costs litigation expenses an equity sale gain debt issuance cost writeoffs and nongaap tax adjustments from gaap net income we believe our investors benefit from understanding these exclusions and from an alternative view of our net income performance as compared to our past net income performance 

nongaap diluted net income per share 

we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap operating performance as reflected in a per share calculation as a way of measuring nongaap operating performance by ownership in the company nongaap diluted net income per share excludes restructuring charges amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisitiondivestiture costs executive transition costs litigation expenses an equity sale gain debt issuance cost writeoffs and nongaap tax adjustments from gaap diluted net income per share we believe that these exclusions offer investors a useful view of our diluted net income per share as compared to our past diluted net income per share 

these nongaap measures can be used to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance as well as our performance relative to competitors we believe some of our investors track our core operating performance as a means of evaluating our performance in the ordinary ongoing and customary course of our operations core operating performance excludes items that are noncash not expected to recur or not reflective of ongoing financial results management also believes that looking at our core operating performance provides a supplemental way to provide consistency in period to period comparisons accordingly management excludes from nongaap those items relating to restructuring charges amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisitiondivestiture items executive transition costs litigation expenses a gain on an equity sale writeoff of debt issuance costs and nongaap tax adjustments for detailed explanations of the adjustments made to comparable gaap measures see items a   l below 





 



that are not indicative of our ongoing operating results we further believe that excluding these items from our nongaap results is useful to investors in that it allows for periodoverperiod comparability     

 

nongaap operating income 

nongaap operating income increased  by 156 million  for fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  and decreased by 899 million for fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  nongaap operating income as a percentage of total revenue was 172 170 and 200 for fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

the nongaap operating income and nongaap operating income percentage for fiscal 2016   increased  primarily due to revenue expansion in engineering and construction and mobile solutions and strong operating expense control across the company the nongaap operating income and nongaap operating income percentage for fiscal 2015 decreased primarily due to revenue declines in engineering and construction and field solutions partially offset by a revenue increase in mobile solutions

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors 

market interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents and shortterm investments consisted primarily of treasury bills debt securities and commercial paper interest and noninterest bearing bank deposits as well as bank time deposits the main objective of these instruments is safety of principal and liquidity while maximizing return without significantly increasing risk 

due to the nature of our cash equivalents and shortterm investments where they are readily convertible to cash we do not anticipate any material effect on our portfolio due to fluctuations in interest rates 

we are exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing interest rates under our credit facilities our 2014 credit facility is comprised of a revolving credit agreement and a letter of credit subfacility with maturity dates of november 24 2019 and also two unsecured uncommitted revolving credit agreements that are callable by the bank at any time we may borrow funds under these facilities in us dollars or in certain other currencies and borrowings will bear interest as described under note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 at the end of fiscal 2016  we had outstanding a revolving loan of 940 million  under the 2014 credit facility and a revolving credit line of 1300 million  under the uncommitted facilities a hypothetical 10 increase in our borrowing rates at the end of fiscal 2016 could result in approximately 02 million annual increase in interest expense on these existing principal balances 

the hypothetical changes and assumptions made above will be different from what actually occurs in the future furthermore the computations do not anticipate actions that may be taken by our management should the hypothetical market changes actually occur over time as a result actual earnings effects in the future will differ from those quantified above 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we operate in international markets which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and various foreign currencies the most significant of which is the euro 

historically the majority of our revenue contracts are denominated in us dollars with the most significant exception being europe where we invoice primarily in euros additionally a portion of our expenses primarily the cost to manufacture cost of personnel to deliver technical support on our products and professional services sales and sales support and research and development are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the euro 

revenue resulting from selling in local currencies and costs incurred in local currencies are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which can affect our operating income as exchange rates vary operating income may differ from expectations in fiscal 2016  revenue was negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange rates by 121 million and operating income was favorably impacted by 32 million respectively currency translation subtracted approximately 1 of revenue and added 2 of operating income in fiscal 2016  

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash and certain trade and intercompany receivables and payables primarily denominated in swiss franc euro british pound and new zealand and canadian dollars these contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rate movements as the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses on the forward contracts these instruments are marked to market through earnings every period and generally range from one to two months in maturity we do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes we occasionally enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase price of some of our larger business acquisitions foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at the end of fiscal 2016  and 2015  are summarized as follows in millions

patents licenses and intellectual property 

we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate we hold over 1100 unique issued and enforceable patents the majority of which cover gnss based technologies and other applications such as optical and laser technology we are not dependent on any one patent we also own numerous trademarks and service marks that contribute to the identity and recognition of trimble and its products and services globally we prefer to own the intellectual property used in our products either directly or through subsidiaries from time to time we license technology from third parties 

competition 

our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future within each of our markets we encounter direct competition from other gnss software optical and laser suppliers such as hexagon and topcon and competition may intensify from various larger us and nonus competitors our hardware products are increasingly subject to competition from existing and new entrants from emerging markets such as china which compete aggressively on price at the lower priced end of the market our integrated hardware and software products may also be subject to increasing competition from mass market devices such as smartphones and tablets combined with relatively inexpensive applications which have not been heavily used for commercial applications in the past 

many of our products and solutions are focused on specific industries in each of these industries we face competition from companies providing point solutions or more traditional less technology intensive products and services which often have greater financial resources and more established and recognized brands in those industries competing in vertical markets with these more established industry participants requires that we successfully establish a market position and market new and sometimes unfamiliar technology and automated solutions to customers that have not previously used such products we also increasingly offer enterprise level solutions designed to meet the specific needs of our target industries in doing so we face competition from larger and more well established providers of enterprise software and services with whom we have not previously competed see also risk factors  we face substantial competition in our markets which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition 

sales and marketing 

we tailor our distribution to the needs of our products and regional markets around the world many of our products are sold worldwide primarily through indirect channels including distributors dealers and authorized representatives occasionally we grant exclusive rights to market certain products within specific countries these channels are supported by our regional sales offices throughout the world we also utilize distribution alliances oem relationships and joint ventures with other companies as a means to serve selected markets as well as direct sales to endusers 

during fiscal 2015 sales to customers in the united states represented 50 europe represented 24 asia pacific represented 14 and other regions represented 12 of our total revenue 

seasonality of business 

construction purchases tend to occur in early spring and us governmental agencies tend to utilize funds available at the end of the government’s fiscal year for additional purchases at the end of our third fiscal quarter in september of each year our agricultural equipment business revenues have historically been the highest in the first quarter followed by the second quarter reflecting buying in anticipation of the spring planting season in the northern hemisphere however overall as a company as a result of diversification of our business across segments and the increased impact of subscription revenues we may experience less seasonality in the future changes in global macroeconomic conditions could also impact the level of seasonality we experience 

backlog 

in most of our markets the time between order placement and shipment is short orders are generally placed by resellers and customers on an asneeded basis in general customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty for these reasons we do not believe that backlog is a meaningful indicator of future revenue or material to understanding our business   

manufacturing 

manufacturing of many of our gnss products is subcontracted to flextronics international limited in mexico we utilize flextronics for geospatial field solutions and mobile solutions products we utilize benchmark electronics inc in china for our embedded technologies and timing products we utilize jabil mexico for our construction and mobile solutions products 

our contract manufacturing partners are responsible for significant material procurement assembly and testing we continue to manage product design through pilot production for the subcontracted products and we are directly involved in qualifying suppliers and key components used in all our products our current contract with flextronics continues in effect until either party gives the other ninety days written notice we also utilize original design manufacturers for some of our products 

we manufacture our laser and opticsbased products as well as some of our gnss products at our plants in dayton ohio danderyd sweden and shanghai china some of these products or portions of these products are also subcontracted to third parties for assembly 

our design manufacturing and distribution sites in dayton ohio sunnyvale california danderyd sweden eersel netherlands and shanghai china are registered to iso90012000 covering the design production distribution and servicing of all our products 

research and development 

we believe that our competitive position is maintained through the development and introduction of new products including software and services that incorporate improved features and functionality better performance smaller size and weight lower cost or some combination of these factors we invest substantially in the development of new products we also make significant investment in the positioning communication and information technologies that underlie our products and will likely provide competitive advantages 

we expect to continue investing in research and development at a rate consistent with our past with the goal of maintaining or improving our competitive position and entering new markets 

employees 

at the end of fiscal 2015 we employed 8451 employees including 14 in manufacturing 34 in engineering 39 in sales and marketing and 13 in general and administrative positions approximately 54 of employees are in locations outside the united states

risks and uncertainties 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k and in any other documents to which we refer you in this form 10k before purchasing our securities the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate which could negatively impact our operations financial results and our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control results in any period could be affected by 

 seasonal variations in demand for our products may also affect our quarterly results construction purchases tend to occur in early spring and us governmental agencies tend to utilize funds available at the end of the government’s fiscal year for additional purchases at the end of our third fiscal quarter in september of each year our agricultural equipment business revenues have historically been the highest in the first quarter followed by the second quarter reflecting buying in anticipation of the spring planting season in the northern hemisphere if we do not accurately forecast seasonal demand we may be left with unsold inventory or have a shortage of inventory which could negatively impact our financial results 

due in part to the buying patterns of our customers a significant portion of our quarterly revenue occurs from orders received and immediately shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of each quarter while our operating expense tends to remain fairly predictable a majority of our sales force earns commissions on a quarterly basis which may cause concentrations of orders at the end of any fiscal quarter it could harm our operating results if for any reason expected sales are deferred orders are not received or shipments are delayed a few days at the end of a quarter 

the price of our common stock could decline substantially in the event such occurrences result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors which are based on historical models that are not necessarily accurate representations of the future 

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect an investment in our common stock 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile during fiscal 2015 our stock price ranged from 1590 to 2762 we believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate perhaps substantially including 

 in addition the stock market in general and the markets for shares of “hightech” companies in particular have frequently experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

global and regional economic conditions and the cyclicality of some of our key markets may negatively impact our businesses and our operating results 

our earnings and financial position are and will continue to be influenced by various macroeconomic factors including increases or decreases in gross domestic product the level of consumer and business confidence changes in interest rates on consumer and business credit fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates energy prices and the cost of commodities such as corn which exist in the various countries in which we operate during 2015 we experienced a strengthening us dollar which had the impact of making some of our products and services more expensive than many of our local competitors 

in the recent past uncertainties in the financial and credit markets have caused our customers to postpone purchases and negative economic conditions may reduce future sales of or demand for our products and services negative economic conditions may depress the tax revenues of government entities which are significant purchasers of our products many of our products are sold through dealer channels and our dealers depend on the availability of credit both to finance purchases of our products for their inventory and to finance purchases by their customers sources of credit could disappear or the financial situation of our channel partners and customers could become such that they are no longer eligible for such financing negative economic conditions may result in increased collection times or greater writeoffs affecting our cash flow our suppliers may be impacted by economic pressures which may adversely affect their ability to fulfill their obligations to us and therefore cause a disruption in our supply chain 

financial conditions in several regions continue to place significant economic pressures on existing and potential customers including our dealer channels there is ongoing concern about economic conditions in europe which has experienced negative impacts from sovereign debt levels and government taxing and spending actions to address such issues other governments may continue to implement measures which may slow the economic growth rate in those countries eg higher interest rates reduced bank lending and other antiinflation measures growth rates in key emerging markets including china have slowed which could affect demand for our products both with respect to the products we sell directly into emerging markets and indirectly by reducing demand for our customers products falling commodity prices have also negatively affected markets such as australia and brazil 

we are subject to the cyclicality of the agricultural and engineering and construction industries which can cause sudden and sometimes material declines in demand with negative effects on sales inventory levels and product pricing in general demand in the engineering and construction industries for our products is highly correlated to the economic cycle and can be subject to even greater levels of volatility the agricultural spending cycle is influenced by general economic conditions as well as weather crop loads commodity pricing especially corn the availability of credit and the strength of the us dollar since 2014 the agricultural sector has been experiencing a significant downturn which is continuing and which has had and may have a negative effect on the company’s overall growth rate in addition new sources of supply and a decline in demand have resulted in a substantial decline in the price of oil and gas since 2014 and as a result the oil and gas industry has been experiencing a significant downturn which is continuing and which has had and may continue to have a negative effect on our engineering and construction business 

if there is significant deterioration in the global economy the economies of key countries or regions or important customer markets the demand for our products and services would likely decrease and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected changes in economic conditions also make it difficult to make financial forecasts which could cause us to miss our financial guidance and adversely affect our stock price 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which can adversely affect our operating results 

fluctuations in currencies impact our operating results which are reported in us dollars a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the us and as such we face exposure to movements in the currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies these exposures may change over time as economic conditions and business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows during 2015 our business was negatively impacted by the strong us dollar which increased the cost of some of our products and services relative to those of local competitors in some jurisdictions if the us dollar remains strong or there is a continued increase in the exchange rate of the us dollar against other currencies it could negatively impact foreign demand for our products or reduce the dollar value of local currency sales possible import export tariff and other trade barriers which could be imposed by the us or by other countries might have a material adverse effect on the business 

currently we routinely hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the short term impact of currency fluctuations 

on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities our attempts to hedge against these risks involve transaction costs and could be unsuccessful and expose us to losses 

investing in and integrating new acquisitions could be costly place a significant strain on our management systems and resources and may fail to deliver the expected return on investment which could negatively impact our operating results 

we typically acquire a number of companies each year and intend to continue to acquire other companies acquisitions of companies entail numerous risks including 

 any such effects from acquisitions could be costly and place a significant strain on our management systems and resources 

as a result of acquisitions we have significant assets that include goodwill and other purchased intangibles the testing of this goodwill and intangibles for impairment under established accounting guidelines requires significant use of judgment and assumptions changes in business conditions could require negative adjustments to the valuation of these assets resulting in writeoffs which adversely affect our results if we divest a business and the proceeds are less than the net book value at the time we would be forced to write off the difference in addition losses incurred by a company in which we have an investment may have a direct impact on our financial statements or could result in our having to writedown the value of such investment 

even if successfully negotiated and closed acquisitions may not yield expected synergies may not advance our business strategy as expected may fall short of expected returnoninvestment targets or may not prove successful or effective for our business companies that we acquire may operate with different cost and margin structures which could further cause fluctuations in our operating results and adversely affect our operating margins 

our internal and customer facing systems and systems of third parties we rely upon may be subject to disruption delays or cybersecurity breaches that could adversely impact our customers and operations 

a cybersecurity incident in our own systems or the systems of our third party providers may compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of our own internal data the availability of our products and websites designed to support our customers or our customer data computer hackers foreign governments or cyber terrorists may attempt to or succeed in penetrating our network security and our website unauthorized access to our proprietary business information or customer data may be obtained through breakins sabotage breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks employee theft or misuse breach of the security of the networks of our third party providers or other misconduct we have experienced security breaches in the past and despite our efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our systems it is virtually impossible to eliminate this risk because the techniques used by computer hackers who may attempt to penetrate and sabotage our network security or our website change frequently may take advantage of weaknesses in third party technology or standards of which we are unaware or that we do not control and may not be recognized until after they have been launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate or counter these techniques it is also possible that unauthorized access to customer data may be obtained through inadequate use of security controls by customers vendors or business partners a cybersecurity incident affecting our systems may also result in theft of our intellectual property proprietary data or trade secrets which would compromise our competitive position reputation and operating results 

the systems we rely upon also remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from a number of other factors including access to the internet the failure of our network or software systems or significant variability in visitor traffic on our product websites earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunication failures computer viruses human error and similar events or disruptions some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities our systems 

are also subject to intentional acts of vandalism despite any precautions we may take the occurrence of a natural disaster a decision by any of our thirdparty hosting providers to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could cause system interruptions and delays and result in loss of critical data and lengthy interruptions in our services 

we rely on our information systems and those of third parties for activities such as processing customer orders delivery of products hosting and providing services and support to our customers billing and tracking our customers hosting and managing our customer data and otherwise running our business any disruptions or unexpected incompatibilities in our information systems and those of the third parties upon whom we rely could have a significant impact on our business 

an increasing portion of our revenue comes from software as a service solutions and other hosted services in which we store retrieve communicate and manage data which is critical to our customers’ business systems disruption of our systems which support these services and solutions could cause disruptions in our customers’ systems and in the businesses that rely on these systems any such disruptions could harm our reputation create liabilities to our customers hurt demand for our services and solutions and negatively impact our revenues and profitability 

we may not be able to enter into or maintain important alliances and distribution relationships 

we believe that in certain business opportunities our success will depend on our ability to form and maintain alliances with industry participants such as caterpillar nikon hilti and cnh global our failure to form and maintain such alliances or the preemption of such alliances by actions of competitors will adversely affect our ability to sell our products to customers our relationships with substantial industry participants such as caterpillar and cnh are complex and multifaceted and may be subject to change based upon the business needs and objectives of the parties since these strategic relationships contribute to significant ongoing business in certain of our important markets changes in these relationships could adversely affect our sales and revenues 

we utilize dealer networks including those affiliated with some of our strategic allies such as caterpillar and cnh global to market sell and service many of our products changes in our product mix including increasing provision of software and bundled solutions tailored to the needs of specific vertical markets impose new demands on our distribution channels and may require significant changes in the skills and expertise required to successfully distribute our products and services or the creation of new distribution channels recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in the use and the selling of our technology and product offerings requires significant time and resources in order to develop and expand our distribution channels we must continue to expand and improve our processes and procedures that support our distribution channels including our investment in systems and training and those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and difficult to manage the time and expense required for sales and marketing organizations of our channel partners to become familiar with our product offerings including our new product developments and newer types of offering such as software and services may make it more difficult to introduce those products to endusers and delay enduser adoption which could result in lower revenues 

disruption of dealer coverage within specific geographic or enduser markets could cause difficulties in marketing selling or servicing our products and have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition moreover dealers who carry products that compete with our products may focus their inventory purchases and sales efforts on goods provided by competitors due to industry demand or profitability such sourcing decisions can adversely impact our sales financial condition and results of operations 

our products are highly technical and may contain undetected errors product defects security vulnerabilities or software errors which could result in damage to our reputation lost revenue diverted development resources and increased service costs warranty claims and litigation 

our products including our software products are highly technical and complex and when deployed may contain errors defects or security vulnerabilities we must develop our products quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing market and we have a history of frequently introducing new products products and services as sophisticated as ours could contain undetected errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new models or versions are released such occurrences could result in damage to our reputation lost revenue diverted development resources increased customer service and support costs warranty claims and litigation 

we warrant that our products will be free of defect for various periods of time depending on the product in addition certain of our contracts include epidemic failure clauses if invoked these clauses may entitle the customer to return or obtain credits for products and inventory or to cancel outstanding purchase orders even if the products themselves are not defective 

errors viruses or bugs may be present in software or hardware that we acquire or license from third parties and incorporate into our products or in third party software or hardware that our customers use in conjunction with our products our customers’ proprietary software and network firewall protections may corrupt data from our products and create difficulties in implementing our solutions changes to third party software or hardware that our customers use in conjunction with our software could also render our applications inoperable any errors defects or security vulnerabilities in our products or any defects in or compatibility 

issues with any third party hardware or software or customers’ network environments discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition loss of customers theft of trade secrets data or intellectual property and increased service and warranty cost any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products alone or in combination with third party hardware or software could expose them to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses and other malicious software programs that could attack our products actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could harm our reputation and lead some customers to return products to reduce or delay future purchases or use competitive products 

if we are unable to effectively manage our increasingly diverse and complex businesses and operations our ability to generate growth and revenue from new or existing customers may be adversely affected 

because our operations are geographically diverse and increasingly complex our personnel resources and infrastructure could become strained and our reputation in the market and our ability to successfully manage and grow our business may be adversely affected the size complexity and diverse nature of our business and the expansion of our product lines and customer base have placed increased demands on our management and operations and further growth if any may place additional strains on our resources in the future our ability to effectively compete and to manage our planned future growth will depend on among other things the following 

 the company has increasingly diversified the nature of its businesses both organically and by acquisition as a result an increasing amount of our business involves business models which require managerial techniques and skill sets which are different from those required to manage our historical core businesses we are increasingly selling products and solutions directly to large enterprise customers and other end users of our products a direct sales model requires different skills and management processes and procedures from those we have generally used in our business in the past and may create conflicts with our channel partners an increasing portion of our business will be associated with professional services in order to customize our solutions for the needs of individual customers which has not previously represented a significant portion of our business if we are not successful in executing on these new models our sales revenue and financial performance may suffer 

changes in our software and subscription businesses may negatively affect our operating results 

an increasing portion of our revenue is generated through software maintenance and subscription revenue our customers have no obligation to renew their agreements for our software maintenance or subscription services after the expiration of their initial contract period which typically range from one to five years our customer acquisition and renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including overall economic conditions the health of their businesses competitive offerings and customer dissatisfaction with our services if customers do not renew their contracts for our products our maintenance and subscription revenue will decline and our financial results will suffer any reduction in the number of licenses that we sell even if our customer acquisition rates do not change will have a negative impact on our future maintenance revenue growth since its introduction our software as a service delivery model has also contributed to subscription revenue if any of our assumptions about expenses revenue or revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect or our attempts to improve efficiency are not successful our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated and our financial results will be negatively impacted 

we continually reevaluate our software licensing programs and subscription renewal programs including specific license models delivery methods and terms and conditions changes to our licensing programs and subscription renewal programs including the timing of the release of enhancements upgrades maintenance releases the term of the contract discounts promotions and other factors could impact the timing of the recognition of revenue for our products related enhancements and services and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition we may implement different licensing models which require the company to recognize licensing fees over a longer period over the last few years we have increasingly offered additional products in a software as a service saas model saas revenues are recognized ratably over the subscription period any significant increase in the percentage of our business generated from such a subscription model could increase the amount of revenue to be recognized over time as opposed to upfront which would delay revenue recognition and have a negative impact on our operating results in any quarterly period due to these complexities associated with revenue recognition we may not be able to accurately forecast our nondeferred and deferred revenues which could cause us to miss our earnings estimates or revenue projections and negatively impact our stock price 

we face substantial competition in our markets which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition 

our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price quality and performance of our products the effectiveness of our distribution channel and direct sales force the level of customer service the development of new technology and our ability to participate in emerging markets within each of our markets we encounter direct competition from other gnss software optical and laser suppliers and competition may intensify from various larger us and nonus competitors and new market entrants particularly from emerging markets such as china our products which commonly use gnss for basic location information may be subject to competition from alternative location technologies such as simultaneous location and mapping technology  as we sell an increasing amount of software and subscription services we face competition from a group of large well established companies with whom we have not previously competed our integrated hardware and software products may be subject to increasing competition from mass market devices such as smartphones and tablets used in conjunction with relatively inexpensive applications which have not been heavily used for commercial applications in the past these developments may require us to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes that we have not previously been exposed to including those related to cloud computing mobile devices and new computing platforms such competition has in the past resulted and in the future may result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the future against existing and additional competitors will depend largely on our ability to execute our strategy to provide products with significantly differentiated features compared to currently available products we may not be able to implement this strategy successfully and our products may not be competitive with other technologies or products that may be developed by our competitors many of whom have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing sales and other resources than we do 

we are dependent on new products and services and if we are unable to successfully introduce them into the market or to effectively compete with new disruptive product alternatives our customer base may decline or fail to grow as anticipated 

our future revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to bring new products and services to market on a timely basis we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products and services enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance of such products and services we may incur problems in the future in innovating and introducing new products and services our development stage products may not be successfully completed or if developed may not achieve significant customer acceptance development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and we might not achieve our goals as to the timing of introducing new technology products or could encounter increased costs the timely availability and cost effective production of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success if we are unable to introduce new products and services if other companies develop competing technology products and services or if we do not develop compelling new products and services our number of customers may not grow as anticipated or may decline which could harm our operating results many of our offerings are increasingly focused on software and subscription services the software industry is characterized by rapidly changing customer preferences which require us to address multiple delivery platforms new mobile devices and cloud computing life cycles of software products can be short and this can exacerbate the risks associated with developing new products the introduction of thirdparty solutions embodying new disruptive technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could make our existing and future software solutions and other products obsolete or noncompetitive if we are not able to develop software and other solutions that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers or if we are unable to adapt to new technologies or new industry standards that impact our markets our ability to retain or increase market share and revenues could be materially adversely affected 

some of our products rely on third party technologies including open source software so if integration or incompatibility issues arise with these technologies or these technologies become unavailable our product and services development may be delayed our reputation could be harmed and our business could be adversely affected 

we license software technologies and intellectual property underlying some of our software from third parties the third party licenses we rely upon may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all and the software and technologies may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors resulting in development delays some software licenses are subject to annual renewals at the discretion of the licensors in many cases if we were to breach a provision of these license agreements the licensor could terminate the agreement immediately the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such third party software or technology could result in increased costs or delays in software releases or updates until such issues have been resolved this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and future prospects 

we also incorporate open source software into our products although we monitor our use of open source software the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a 

manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market or sell our products or to develop new products in such event we could be required to seek licenses from thirdparties in order to continue offering our products to disclose and offer royaltyfree licenses in connection with our own source code to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis any of which could adversely affect our business 

we are dependent on proprietary technology which could result in litigation that could divert significant valuable resources 

our future success and competitive position is dependent upon our proprietary technology and we rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright law to protect our intellectual property the patents owned or licensed by us may be invalidated circumvented infringed and challenged the rights granted under these patents may not provide competitive advantages to us any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us if at all 

despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain our software or develop software with the same functionality or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology duplicate our technology or design around the patents owned by us in addition effective copyright patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in certain countries the steps taken by us to protect our technology might not prevent the misappropriation of such technology 

the value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many current patent filings thirdparties may claim that we or our customers some of whom are indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights for example individuals and groups may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from us or our customers the number of these claims has increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future as new patents are issued or are brought to our attention by the holders of such patents it may be necessary for us to secure a license from such patent holders redesign our products or withdraw products from the market in addition the legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant expense of operations any such litigation could require us to incur substantial costs and divert significant valuable resources including the efforts of our technical and management personnel which could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

our global operations expose us to risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally and our results of operations may be adversely affected by our efforts to comply with the laws of other countries as well as us laws which apply to international operations such as the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and us export control laws 

we operate on a global basis with offices or activities in europe africa asia south america australasia and north america we face risks inherent in conducting business internationally including compliance with international and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations these laws and regulations include data privacy requirements labor relations laws tax laws anticompetition regulations import and trade restrictions export control laws and laws which prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers which may include the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the uk bribery act or other anticorruption laws that have recently been the subject of a substantial increase in global enforcement many of our products are subject to us export law restrictions that limit the destinations and types of customers to which our products may be sold or require an export license in connection with sales outside the united states given the high level of complexity of these laws there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently or intentionally breached for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise also we may be held liable for actions taken by our local dealers and partners violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees and prohibitions on the conduct of our business any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our operating results 

in addition we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced significant governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices we may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence or through other methods that relevant law and regulations prohibit us from using our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties 

in addition to the foregoing engaging in international business inherently involves a number of other difficulties and risks including 

 

these factors or any combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue or our overall financial performance 

we are dependent on a specific manufacturer and assembler for many of our products and on other manufacturers and specific suppliers of critical parts for our products 

we are substantially dependent upon flextronics international limited as our preferred manufacturing partner for many of our gnss products under our agreement with flextronics we provide a twelvemonth product forecast and place purchase orders with flextronics at least thirty calendar days in advance of the scheduled delivery of products to our customers depending on production lead time although purchase orders placed with flextronics are cancelable the terms of the agreement would require us to purchase from flextronics all inventory not returnable or usable by other flextronics customers accordingly if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products we may be unable to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity from flextronics to meet customers’ delivery requirements or we may accumulate excess inventories if such inventories are not usable by other flextronics customers our current contract with flextronics continues in effect until either party gives the other ninety days written notice 

we rely on specific suppliers for a number of our critical components and on other contract manufacturers including benchmark electronics and jabil for the manufacture test and assembly of certain products and components we have experienced shortages of components in the past our current reliance on specific or a limited group of suppliers and contract manufacturers involves risks including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components reduced control over pricing and delivery schedules discontinuation of certain components and economic conditions which may adversely impact the viability of our suppliers and contract manufacturers this situation may be exacerbated during any period of economic recovery or a competitive environment any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture assemble and test such components internally could significantly delay our ability to ship our products which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our reputation and brand as well as our operating results 

we are dependent on the availability and unimpaired use of allocated bands within the radio frequency spectrum and our products may be subject to harmful interference from new or modified spectrum uses 

our gnss technology is dependent on the use of satellite signals and on terrestrial communication bands international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union itu a specialized technical agency of the united nations these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference each country also has regulatory authority over how each band is used in the country in the united states the federal communications commission fcc and the national telecommunications and information administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations 

any itu or local reallocation of radio frequency bands including frequency band segmentation and sharing of spectrum or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our customers both of which could reduce demand for our products for example the fcc has been considering proposals to repurpose spectrum adjacent to the gps bands for terrestrial broadband wireless operations throughout the united states if the fcc were to permit implementation of such proposals or similar proposals terrestrial broadband wireless operations could create harmful interference to gps receivers within range of such operations and impose costs to retrofit or replace affected receivers similarly other countries have considered proposals for use of frequencies used by our products as well as adjacent bands that could cause harmful interference to our products 

many of our products use other radio frequency bands such as the public land mobile radio bands together with the gnss signal to provide enhanced gnss capabilities such as realtime kinematics precision the continuing availability of these nongnss radio frequencies is essential to provide enhanced gnss products to our precision survey agriculture and construction machine controls markets in addition transmissions and emissions from other services and equipment operating in adjacent frequency 

bands or inband may impair the utility and reliability of our products any regulatory changes in spectrum allocation or in allowable operating conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

many of our products rely on gnss technology gps and other satellite systems which may become degraded or inoperable and result in lost revenue 

gnss technology gps satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible intentional disruption many of the gps satellites currently in orbit were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of 30 operational satellites in orbit eight have been in operation for more than 15 years and over half have been in use for more than 75 years repair of damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites a reduction in the number of operating satellites below the 24satellite standard established for gps may impair the utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities in addition software updates to gps satellites and ground control segments can cause problems and we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of such updates to mitigate these problems 

as the principal gnss currently in operation we are dependent on continued operation of gps the gps constellation is operated by the u s government which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps if supporting policies were to change or if user fees were imposed it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

many of our products also use signals from systems that augment gps such as the wide area augmentation system and national differential gps system and satellites transmitting signal corrections data on mobile satellite services frequencies utilized by our rtx corrections services some of these augmentation systems are operated by the us government and rely on continued funding and maintenance of these systems any curtailment of the operating capability of these systems or limitations on access to or use of the signals or discontinuance of service could result in degradation of our services or product performance with an adverse effect on our business 

many of our products use satellite signals from the russian glonass system other countries including china and india are in the process of creating their own gnss systems and we either have developed or will develop products which use gnss signals from these systems the european community is developing an independent radio navigation satellite system known as galileo national or european authorities may provide preferential access to signals to companies associated with their markets including our competitors which could harm our competitive position use of nonus gnss signals may also be subject to restrictions based upon international trade or geopolitical considerations if we are unable to develop timely and competitive commercial products using these systems or obtain timely and equal access to service signals this could result in lost revenue these authorities may also adopt protectionist measures favoring national companies who make use of their gnss systems to the detriment of trimble products using the us gps system which would harm our business 

we are subject to the impact of governmental and other similar certifications processes and regulations which could adversely affect our products and our business 

we market certain products that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold for example ce certification for radiated emissions is required for most gnss receiver and data communications products sold in the european community in the future us governmental authorities may propose gps receiver testing and certification for compliance with published gps signal interface or other specifications an inability to obtain any such certifications in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our operating results governmental authorities may also propose other forms of gps receiver performance standards which may limit design alternatives hamper product innovation or impose additional costs some of our products that use integrated radio communication technology require product type certification and some products require an enduser to obtain licensing from the fcc for frequencyband usage these are secondary licenses that are subject to certain restrictions an inability or delay in obtaining such certifications or changes to the rules by the fcc could adversely affect our ability to bring our products to market which could harm our customer relationships and therefore our operating results any failure to obtain the requisite certifications could also harm our operating results 

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes 

we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes can be difficult to predict management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability or may suffer unforeseen liabilities which could then impact the results of a financial period a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final 

outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable which if not expected could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income in future periods 

as a global company we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities our effective tax rate is largely based on the geographic mix of earnings statutory rates intercompany transfer pricing and enacted tax laws a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates including 

 on october 5 2015 the oecd released the final reports from its beps action plans the beps recommendations covered a number of issues including countrybycountry reporting permanent establishment rules transfer pricing rules and tax treaties in january 2016 the ec announced an anti tax avoidance package containing measures to regulate certain elements of tax planning further and to boost tax transparency for consideration by the european parliament and council meanwhile in the us a number of proposals for broad reform of the corporate tax system are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies future tax reform resulting from these developments may result in changes to longstanding tax principles which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities it is not possible to accurately determine the overall impact of such proposals on our effective tax rate at this time 

we are currently in various stages of multiple year examinations by federal state and foreign taxing authorities including a review of our 2010 to 2012 tax years by the us internal revenue service or irs we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision if the irs or the taxing authorities of any other jurisdiction were to successfully challenge a material tax position we could become subject to higher taxes and our earnings would be adversely affected 

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us 

generally accepted accounting principles in the us are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board or fasb the sec and other bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles for example in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under us gaap this standard establishes a principle for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services the standard also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining and fulfilling customer contracts in august 2015 the fasb subsequently issued asu 201514 which deferred the effectiveness of asu 201409 so that it will now be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 including interim periods within that reporting period early adoption is permitted as of the original effective date we are currently in the process of assessing the adoption methodology which allows the amendment to be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application we are also evaluating the impact of the adoption of asu no 201409 on our consolidated financial statements and have not determined whether the effect will be material adoption of this standard along with any other changes in accounting principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change any difficulties in the implementation of new or changed accounting standards could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations changes in applicable accounting standards could have a significant effect on our reported financial results if our estimates relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions or judgments that change or prove to be incorrect our operating results could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price 

our debt could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations 

on november 24 2014 we issued senior notes notes due december 1 2024 in an aggregate principal amount of 4000 million the notes accrue interest at a rate of 475 per annum payable semiannually in arrears on december 1 and june 1 of each year beginning on june 1 2015 when the notes mature we will have to expend significant resources to repay these notes or seek to refinance them if we decide to refinance the notes we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the notes at all both of which may adversely affect our financial condition 

on november 24 2014 we entered into a new fiveyear credit agreement with a group of lenders the 2014 credit facility the 2014 credit facility provides for an unsecured revolving loan facility of 10 billion subject to the terms of the 2014 credit facility the revolving loan facility may be increased and term loan facilities may be established in an amount of up to 5000 million we also have two 75 million revolving credit facilities which are uncommitted and may be called by the lenders with very little notice the uncommitted facilities at the end of fiscal 2015 our total debt was comprised primarily of notes of 4000 million a revolving loan balance of 2160 million  under the 2014 credit facility and a revolving credit line balance of 1180 million  under the uncommitted facilities 

our outstanding indebtedness could have important consequences such as 

 there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and we may not be able to repay the indebtedness that becomes due a default under our debt instruments may also significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control a significant portion of our outstanding debt has interest rates which float based on prevailing interest rates if interest rates increase our interest expense will also increase 

our ability to incur additional indebtedness over time may be limited due to applicable financial covenants and restrictions and due to the risk that significantly increasing our level of indebtedness could impact the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations which in turn would increase the interest rates and fees that we pay in connection with our indebtedness 

our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war terrorism or civil unrest 

acts of war acts of terrorism or other circumstances of civil unrest especially any directed at the gnss signals or systems could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may invoke a redeployment of the satellites used in gnss or interruptions of the system civil unrest local conflict or other political instability may adversely impact regional economies cause work stoppages and limitations on foreign business transactions to the extent that such interruptions result in delays or cancellations of orders disruption of the manufacture or shipment of our products or reduced demand for our products it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to the secs rules regarding the use and disclosure of conflict minerals which involves increased operating and compliance costs and could potentially harm our reputation causing a decline in our stock price 

the sec adopted its final rule implementing section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act concerning conflict minerals during august 2012 the goal of the rule is to cut direct and indirect funding of groups engaged in armed conflict and human rights abuses we are committed to compliance with the secs conflict minerals rule and support its intended objective this rule requires us to 1 determine whether conflict minerals tin tantalum tungsten gold or similar derivatives are used in our products and if so determine if the minerals originated from the democratic republic of congo drc or its immediately adjoining countries and 2 if so conduct due diligence regarding the source and chain of custody of these conflict minerals to determine whether the conflict minerals financed or benefitted armed groups the rule requires us to submit forms and reports to the sec annually that disclose our determinations and due diligence measures 

trimble does not directly purchase any conflicts minerals tracing these materials back to their country of origin is a complex task that may require us to among other things survey suppliers in our supply chain to understand what programs they have in place for tracing the source of minerals supplied to us or used in products supplied to us and to ensure that reasonable due diligence has been performed presently we have not determined how many or if any of our supply chain partners use conflict minerals in addition to the increased administrative expense required to comply with the new requirements that apply to us we may face a limited pool of suppliers who can provide us “conflictfree” components parts and manufactured products and we may not be able to obtain conflictfree products or supplies in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices for our operations and may be required to disclose that our products are not “conflict free” this could adversely affect the company’s reputation and may harm its relationships with business partners and customers and our stock price could suffer as a result

stock repurchase program 

in august 2014 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program 2014 stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to 3000 million of trimble’s common stock replacing a stock repurchase program which had been in place since 2011 in august 2015 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program 2015 stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to 4000 million of trimble’s common stock replacing the 2014 stock repurchase program 

during fiscal 2015 we repurchased approximately 75 million shares of common stock in open market purchases at an average price of 2129 per share for a total of 1594 million this total includes 751 million and 843 million of open market purchases completed under the 2015 and 2014 stock repurchase programs respectively 

as part of the 2015 stock repurchase program in september 2015 we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement or asr with an investment bank for 750 million the asr was completed in december 2015 and resulted in the aggregate repurchase of approximately 37 million shares of common stock with a volume weighted average price of 2011 per share 

during fiscal 2014 under the provisions of both the 2014 and 2011 stock repurchase programs we repurchased approximately 32 million shares of common stock in open market purchases at an average price of 3022 per share for a total of 978 million 

no shares of common stock were repurchased during fiscal 2013 

stock repurchases are reflected as a decrease to common stock based on the average book value per share for all outstanding shares calculated at the time of each individual repurchase transaction the excess of the purchase price over this average for each repurchase was charged to retained earnings as a result of the 2015 repurchases retained earnings was reduced by 1803 million in fiscal 2015 common stock repurchases under the program were recorded based upon the trade date for accounting purposes all common shares repurchased under this program have been canceled at the end of fiscal 2015 the 2015 stock repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of 2499 million 

the following table provides information relating to our common stock repurchase activity during the fourth quarter of 2015

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that reflect our plans estimates and beliefs our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and those listed under “risks factors” 

executive level overview 

trimble navigation limited is a leading provider of technology solutions that optimize the work processes of office and mobile field professionals around the world our comprehensive work process solutions are used across a range of industries including agriculture architecture civil engineering construction environmental management government natural resources transportation and utilities representative trimble customers include engineering and construction firms contractors surveying companies farmers and agricultural companies enterprise firms with largescale fleets energy mining and utility companies and state federal and municipal governments 

trimble focuses on integrating its broad technological and application capabilities to create verticallyfocused systemlevel solutions that transform how work is done within the industries we serve the integration of sensors software connectivity and information in our portfolio gives us the unique ability to provide an information model specific to the customer’s workflow for example in construction our strategy is centered on the concept of a “constructible model” which will provide a realtime connected and cohesive information environment for the design build and operational phases of a project in agriculture we continue to develop “connected farm” solutions to optimize operations across the agriculture workflow in transportation and logistics we provide transportation companies with tools to enhance fuel efficiency safety and transparency across the enterprise 

our growth strategy is centered on multiple elements 

 

trimble’s focus on these growth drivers has led over time to growth in revenue and profitability as well as an increasingly diversified business model software and services growth is driving increased recurring revenue leading to improved visibility in our business as our solutions have expanded our go to market model has also evolved with a balanced mix between direct distribution and oem customers and an increasing number of enterprise level customer relationships 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements we consider the accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting policies these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer or is uncertain revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 

contracts andor customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement shipping documents and customer acceptance when applicable are used to verify delivery we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analyses as well as the customer’s payment history 

revenue for orders is not recognized until the product is shipped and title has transferred to the buyer we bear all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods up to that point our shipment terms for us orders and international orders fulfilled from our european distribution center typically provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the carrier named by the buyer at the named place or point if no precise point is indicated by the buyer delivery is deemed to occur when the carrier takes the goods into its charge from the place determined by us other shipment terms may provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the buyer shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 

revenue from sales to distributors and dealers is recognized upon shipment assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met distributors and dealers do not have a right of return 

revenue from purchased extended warranty and post contract support pcs agreements is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the warranty or support period revenue from our subscription services related to our hardware and applications is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription service period beginning on the date that service is made available to the customer assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been met 

we present revenue net of sales taxes and any similar assessments 

our software arrangements generally consist of a perpetual license fee and pcs we generally have established vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for our pcs contracts based on the renewal rate the remaining value of the software arrangement is allocated to the license fee using the residual method license revenue is primarily recognized when the software has been delivered and fair value has been established for all remaining undelivered elements in cases where vsoe of fair value for pcs is not established revenue is recognized ratably over the pcs period after all software deliverables have been made and the only the undelivered element is pcs 

for services performed on a fixedfee basis revenue is recognized using the proportional performance method with performance measured based on hours of work performed for contracts that involve significant customization and implementation or consulting services that are essential to the functionality of the software the license and services revenues are recognized using the percentageofcompletion method or if we are unable to reliably estimate the costs to complete the services we use the completedcontract method of accounting a contract is considered complete when all significant costs have been incurred or when acceptance from the customer has been received 

some of our subscription product offerings include hardware subscription services and extended warranty under these hosted arrangements the customer typically does not have the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the 

hosting period without incurring a significant penalty and it is not feasible for the customer to run the software either on its own hardware or on a thirdparty’s hardware 

our multiple deliverable product offerings include hardware with embedded firmware extended warranty software pcs services and subscription services which are considered separate units of accounting for certain of our products software and nonsoftware components function together to deliver the tangible product’s essential functionality 

in evaluating the revenue recognition for our hardware or subscription agreements which contain multiple deliverables we determined that in certain instances we were not able to establish vsoe for some or all deliverables in an arrangement as we infrequently sold each element on a standalone basis did not price products within a narrow range or had a limited sales history when vsoe cannot be established we attempt to establish the selling price of each element based on relevant thirdparty evidence tpe tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately our offerings may contain a significant level of proprietary technology customization or differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained furthermore we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products’ selling prices are on a standalone basis therefore we typically are not able to establish the selling price of an element based on tpe 

when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe we use our best estimate of selling price besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis besp is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a standalone basis or for new or highly customized offerings we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including but not limited to pricing practices market conditions competitive landscape internal costs geographies and gross margin the determination of besp is made through consultation with and formal approval by our management taking into consideration our gotomarket strategy 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred tax asset or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized 

relative to uncertain tax positions we only recognize a tax benefit if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual tax audit outcomes determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment changes in recognition or measurement of our uncertain tax positions would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision our practice is to recognize interest andor penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 

our valuation allowance is primarily attributable to foreign net operating losses and state research and development credit carryforwards management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize these deferred tax assets and accordingly a valuation allowance has been provided for such amounts valuation allowance adjustments associated with an acquisition after the measurement period are recorded through income tax expense 

business combinations 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree based on their fair values at the acquisition date the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill 

when determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to expected future cash flows which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins customer attrition rates future changes in technology and brand awareness loyalty and position and discount rates fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available 

goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination intangible assets acquired individually with a group of other assets or in a business combination are recorded at fair value identifiable intangible assets are comprised of distribution channels and distribution rights patents licenses technology acquired backlog trademarks and inprocess research and development the fair value of intangible assets acquired is generally determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straightline method reflecting the pattern of economic benefits associated with these assets and have estimated useful lives ranging from one to twelve years with a weighted average useful life of 62 years goodwill is not subject to amortization but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment applying a fairvalue based test 

impairment of goodwill intangible assets and other longlived assets 

we evaluate goodwill at a minimum on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year based on the values on the first day of that quarter goodwill was reviewed for impairment utilizing a quantitative twostep process in the first step of this test goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit’s carrying amount including goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a discounted cash flow approach if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in step two the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill the difference is recognized as an impairment loss when we perform a quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment the determination of fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions the discounted cash flows are based upon among other things assumptions about expected future operating performance using riskadjusted discount rates actual future results may differ from those estimates as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 the fair value for our reporting units ranged from 131 to approximately 701 of carrying amounts therefore goodwill was not impaired and no further testing was required for certain earlier stage reporting units due to the smaller magnitude of the carrying value and fair value of each respective reporting unit the margins by which the fair value exceeded the carrying value on an absolute dollar basis were relatively small 

depreciation and amortization of the intangible assets and other longlived assets is provided using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives reflecting the pattern of economic benefits associated with these assets changes in circumstances such as technological advances changes to our business model or changes in the capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives of intangible assets or other longlived assets differing from initial estimates in cases where we determine that the useful life of an asset should be revised the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value will be depreciated over its revised remaining useful life these assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable based on their future cash flows the estimated future cash flows are based upon among other things assumptions about expected future operating performance and these estimates may differ from actual future cash flows the assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value 

warranty costs 

the liability for product warranties was 185 million at the end of fiscal 2015  as compared with 206 million at the end of fiscal 2014  we accrue for warranty costs as part of cost of sales based on associated material product costs technical support labor costs and costs incurred by third parties performing work on our behalf our expected future cost is primarily estimated based upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment when products sold include warranty provisions they are covered by a warranty for periods ranging generally from 1 year to 2 years 

while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates revisions to the estimated warranty accrual and related costs may be required 

stockbased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to our employees and directors based on estimated fair values net of estimated forfeitures the grant date fair value for options is estimated using a binomial valuation model the fair value of rights to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plan is estimated using the blackscholes optionpricing model the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant the fair value of restricted stock units with marketbased vesting conditions is valued as of the grant date using a monte carlo simulation 

the determination of fair value of sharebased payment awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors riskfree interest rates and any expected dividends in addition the binomial model incorporates actual optionpricing behavior and changes in volatility over the option’s contractual term the monte carlo simulation takes into account the same input assumptions as the binomial option pricing model as outlined above however it also incorporates into the fairvalue determination the possibility that the marketbased vesting conditions may not be satisfied and the impact of the possible differing stock price paths for trimble and each of the constituents of the sp 500 if factors change and we employ different assumptions to determine the fair value of our sharebased payment awards granted in future periods the compensation expense that we record under it may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 

stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures the stockbased compensation guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates if actual forfeitures different materially from our estimates stockbased compensation recognized many not be reflective of what was earned in that period 

inventory valuation 

our inventories net balance was 2611 million  at the end of fiscal 2015  as compared with 2781 million at the end of fiscal 2014  our inventory allowances at the end of fiscal 2015  were 467 million as compared with 411 million at the end of fiscal 2014  our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market adjustments are also made to reduce the cost of inventory for estimated excess or obsolete balances factors influencing these adjustments include declines in demand which impact inventory purchasing forecasts technological changes product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues if our estimates used to reserve for excess and obsolete inventory are different from what we expected we may be required to recognize additional reserves which would negatively impact our gross margin 

results of operations 

overview 

the following table is a summary of revenue gross margin and operating income for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

  



basis of presentation 

we have a 5253 week fiscal year ending on the friday nearest to december 31 which for fiscal 2015 was january 1 2016 fiscal 2015 and 2014 were both 52week years fiscal 2013 was a 53week year 

revenue 

in fiscal 2015  total revenue decreased by 1051 million  or 4  to 229 billion  from 240 billion  in fiscal 2014  overall revenue was primarily impacted by negative foreign currency effects and to a lesser extent declines due to oil and gas and agricultural market conditions partially offset by acquisitions and improved growth in building construction and transportation and logistics 

on a segment basis the decrease in fiscal 2015  was primarily due to engineering and construction and field solutions partially offset by the increase in mobile solutions engineering and construction revenue decreased 648 million  or 5  field solutions revenue decreased 668 million  or 16 and advanced devices decreased 70 million  or 5  partially offset by an increase in mobile solutions of 335 million  or 7  as compared to fiscal 2014  the decline in engineering and construction was primarily driven by the impact of foreign currency effects due to the weaker euro and to a lesser extent oil price declines on regional economies primarily in geospatial the decline was partially offset by building construction which was up due to organic growth and to a lesser extent acquisitions not applicable in the prior year the decline in field solutions revenue was primarily due to softness in agricultural markets and to a lesser extent gis and foreign currency effects mobile solutions revenue increased due to continued growth in the transportation and logistics market advanced devices revenue decreased primarily due to weaker sales of timing component products 

by revenue category overall product revenue decreased 1801 million  or 11  service revenue increased 239 million  or 6  and subscription revenue increased 511 million  or 18  the product revenue decrease was primarily within engineering and construction and field solutions slightly offset by a product revenue increase in mobile solutions service and subscription increases were primarily due to organic growth within engineering and construction and mobile solutions as we continue to expand software and services including implementation and maintenance and subscription services as a portion of our revenue although to a lesser extent acquisitions growth within engineering and construction also contributed we consider organic growth to include all revenue except for revenue associated with acquisitions made within the last four quarters 

in fiscal 2014 total revenue increased by 1074 million or 5 to 240 billion from 229 billion in fiscal 2013 overall revenue was up due to growth in building construction heavy civil and transportation and logistics markets partially offset by a decline in agricultural market conditions 

on a segment basis the increase in fiscal 2014 was primarily due to engineering and construction and mobile solutions and to a lesser extent advanced devices engineering and construction revenue increased 1261 million or 10 mobile solutions increased 217 million or 5 and advanced devices increased 114 million or 9 partially offset by a decrease in field solutions of 518 million or 11 as compared to fiscal 2013 revenue growth within engineering and construction was driven primarily by organic growth due to building construction heavy civil and to a lesser extent geospatial products in the us and europe to a lesser extent acquisitions contributed to the growth mobile solutions revenue increased primarily due to organic growth in the transportation and logistics market advanced devices revenue increased due to stronger sales of embedded and timing components field solutions revenue decreased significantly primarily due to softness in agricultural markets 

by revenue category overall product revenue increased 637 million or 4 service revenue increased 317 million or 9 and subscription revenue increased 120 million or 4 the product and service revenue increase in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was driven primarily by growth across engineering and construction and mobile solutions which included organic growth and to a lesser extent the impact of acquisitions product revenue growth was partially offset by a significant decrease in field solutions revenue primarily due to softness in agriculture subscription growth was driven by growth in mobile solutions partially offset by our change in accounting for virtual site solutions our joint venture with caterpillar which is now treated as an equity method investment in the prior year as a majority owner we consolidated virtual site solutions results and virtual site solutions revenue was included in engineering and construction subscription revenue 

during fiscal 2015  sales to customers in the united states represented 50 europe represented 24 asia pacific represented 14 and other regions represented 12 of our total revenue during fiscal 2014 sales to customers in the united states represented 48 europe represented 24 asia pacific represented 14 and other regions represented 14 of our total revenue during fiscal 2013 sales to customers in the united states represented 49 europe represented 23 asia pacific represented 14 and other regions represented 14 of our total revenue we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue 

no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenue in fiscal 2015  2014  or 2013  no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our accounts receivable as of fiscal years ended 2015 and 2014 

gross margin 

our gross margin varies due to a number of factors including product mix pricing distribution channel production volumes new product startup costs and foreign currency translations 

in fiscal 2015  our gross margin decreased by 886 million  as compared to fiscal 2014  primarily due to decreased revenue in engineering and construction and field solutions gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 525  in fiscal 2015  and 539  in fiscal 2014  the decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily in engineering and construction due to product mix and foreign currency effects due to the weaker euro and to a lesser extent due to an increase in intangible asset amortization 

in fiscal 2014  our gross margin increased by 870 million as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to the increase in total revenue gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 539 in fiscal 2014 and 526 in fiscal 2013 the increase in the gross margin percentage was due to improved product mix in engineering and construction and mobile solutions particularly software software maintenance and subscription revenue this was partially offset by higher amortization of purchased intangibles and lower gross margin in field solutions due to manufacturing underutilization 

operating income 

operating income decreased by  1064 million  for fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  operating income as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2015  was 67  as compared to 109  for fiscal 2014  the decrease in operating income and operating income percentage was primarily due to revenue declines in engineering and construction and field solutions and increased restructuring partially offset by the effects of operating expense control also higher revenue in mobile solutions partially offset the declines 

operating income increased by 91 million for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 operating income as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2014 was 109 as compared to 110 for fiscal 2013 the decrease in operating income and operating income percentage was primarily due to the revenue decrease in field solutions and the impact of acquisitions in engineering and construction in the fourth quarter of the year the decrease was partially offset by gross margin improvements due to higher margin software maintenance and subscription revenue 

results by segment 

to achieve distribution marketing production and technology advantages in our targeted markets we manage our operations in the following four segments engineering and construction field solutions mobile solutions and advanced devices segment operating income equals net revenue less cost of sales and operating expense excluding general corporate expense amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisition costs and restructuring costs 

the following table is a breakdown of revenue and operating income by segment for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

  



historically we allocated stockbased compensation to each segment beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2015 we changed our methodology for allocating stockbased compensation to our segments stockbased compensation is shown in the aggregate within unallocated corporate expense and is not reflected in the segment results which is consistent with the way the chief operating decision maker codm evaluates each of the segments performance and allocates resources the change in the allocation of stockbased compensation is designed to help ensure that business segment results reflect how the codm makes decisions about resource allocations and assessing segment performance we have adjusted the presentation of segment information for fiscal 2014 and 2013 to conform to the current year methodology the following table shows the amount of stockbased compensation that had been previously allocated to the business segments in fiscal 2014 and 2013 and the impact to those segments operating income 



a reconciliation of our consolidated segment operating income to consolidated income before income taxes follows 

  

unallocated corporate expense includes general corporate expense amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisitiondivestiture costs and litigation expenses 

engineering and construction 

engineering and construction revenue decreased by 648 million  or 5  while segment operating income decreased by 653 million  or 23  for fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  the revenue decrease for fiscal 2015 was primarily driven by the negative foreign currency effects due to the weaker euro and to a lesser extent the impact of oil price declines on regional economies which impacted sales primarily in geospatial to the extent these trends continue our results of operations could be further impacted the decline was partially offset by building construction which was up due to organic growth and acquisitions not applicable in the prior year 

segment operating income decreased primarily due to decreased revenue and lower gross margin resulting from product mix and foreign currency effects due to the weaker euro slightly offset by the effects of operating expense control although acquisitions contributed to revenue they also presented a short term negative impact on revenue and operating income partly because of deferred revenue accounting effects 

engineering and construction revenue increased by 1261 million or 10 while segment operating income increased by 205 million or 8 for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 the revenue growth was primarily driven by organic growth in the global sales of building construction and heavy civil the impact of acquisition revenue on the full year was relatively minor sales were relatively strong in the us particularly for building construction products and heavy civil products which continued to grow however european markets demonstrated some slowness in growth geospatial sales were relatively stable during the year but slowed in the fourth quarter due to the impact of oil price declines 

segment operating income increased primarily due to higher revenue and a more favorable product mix including higher margin software service and subscription revenue this was partially offset by the impact of increased operating expenses due in part to the impact of acquisitions although acquisitions contributed to revenue they also presented a short term negative impact on revenue and operating income partly because of deferred revenue accounting effects 

field solutions 

field solutions revenue decreased by 668 million  or 16  while segment operating income decreased by 292 million  or 21  for fiscal year 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  the revenue decrease was primarily due to continued softness in agriculture markets particularly in the oem channels and to a lesser extent gis and negative foreign currency effects due to the weaker euro segment operating income decreased due to the revenue decrease described above partially offset by the effects of operating expense control 

field solutions revenue decreased by 518 million or 11 while segment operating income decreased by 384 million or 22 for fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 the revenue decrease was primarily due to softness in agriculture markets where the market environment grew significantly more difficult in the last half of the year the agriculture decrease was partially offset by a slight increase in geographic information system gis sales segment operating income decreased primarily due to the revenue decrease in agriculture 

mobile solutions 

mobile solutions revenue increased by 335 million  or 7  while segment operating income increased by 76 million  or 10  for fiscal year 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  the revenue increase was primarily due to continued organic growth in the transportation and logistics market which focuses on enterprise solutions this was partially offset by a decline in field services 

and negative foreign currency effects due to the weaker euro segment operating income increased due to increased revenue and product mix including higher software maintenance and subscription revenue 

mobile solutions revenue increased by 217 million or 5 while segment operating income increased by 100 million or 15 for fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 the revenue increase was primarily due to continued organic growth in the transportation and logistics market which focuses on enterprise solutions this was partially offset by a decline in field services as the focus shifts to more vertical markets segment operating income increased due to increased revenue and product mix including higher software maintenance and subscription revenue as well as product cost reductions 

advanced devices 

advanced devices revenue decreased by 70 million  or 5  and segment operating income increased by 26 million  or 6  for fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  the decrease in revenue was primarily driven by decreased sales of timing component products while the increase in operating income was due to gross margin expansion due to product mix and operating expense control 

advanced devices revenue increased by 114 million or 9 and segment operating income increased by 145 million or 49 for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 the increase in revenue and operating income was primarily driven by increased sales of timing and embedded component products as well as operating expense control 

research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 

the following table shows research and development “rd” sales and marketing and general and administrative “ga” expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions of those operating expenses below 

  



overall rd sales and marketing and ga expenses increased by approximately 139 million  in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  all of our rd costs have been expensed as incurred 

research and development expense increased by  187 million  or 6 in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 overall research and development spending was 15 of revenue in fiscal 2015 versus 13 in fiscal 2014 as compared to the prior year fiscal 2015 rd expense increased 7 due to compensation and other expenses and 5 due to fiscal 2015 business acquisitions partially offset by a 6 decrease due to favorable foreign exchange rates 

research and development expense increased by 186 million or 6 in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 overall research and development spending was 13 of revenue in both fiscal 2014 and 2013 as compared to the prior year fiscal 2014 rd expense increased 4 due to fiscal 2014 business acquisitions and 3 due to compensation and other expenses partially offset by a 1 decrease due to favorable foreign exchange rates 

we believe that the development and introduction of new products are critical to our future success and we expect to continue active development of new products 

sales and marketing expense decreased by 130 million  or 3 in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 overall spending for sales and marketing was 16 of revenue in both fiscal 2015 and 2014 as compared to the prior year fiscal 2015 sales and marketing expense decreased 6 due to favorable foreign exchange rates and 1 due to lower compensation and other expenses partially offset by a 4 increase due to fiscal 2015 business acquisitions 

sales and marketing expense increased by 395 million or 11 in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 overall spending for sales and marketing was 16 of revenue in fiscal 2014 versus 15 in fiscal 2013 as compared to the prior year fiscal 2014 

sales and marketing expense increased 8 due to compensation and other expenses and 4 due to fiscal 2014 business acquisitions partially offset by a 1 decrease due to favorable foreign exchange rates 

general and administrative expense increased by  82 million  or 3 in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 overall general and administrative spending was 11 of revenue in fiscal 2015 versus 10 in fiscal 2014 as compared to the prior year fiscal 2015 general and administrative expense increased 8 due to fiscal 2015 business acquisitions partially offset by a 4 decrease due to favorable foreign exchange rates and 1 decrease due to compensation and other expenses 

general and administrative expense increased by 302 million or 14 in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 overall general and administrative spending was 10 of revenue in fiscal 2014 versus 9 in fiscal 2013 as compared to the prior year fiscal 2014 general and administrative expense increased 8 due to compensation and other expenses and 6 due to fiscal 2014 business acquisitions 

amortization of purchased intangible assets 

  



total amortization expense of purchased intangible assets was 1624 million  in fiscal 2015  of which 926 million  was recorded in cost of sales and 698 million  was recorded in operating expenses total amortization expense of purchased intangibles represented 71  of revenue in fiscal 2015  an increase of  39 million  from fiscal 2014  when it represented 66  of revenue the increase was primarily due to acquisitions not included in fiscal 2014 partially offset by the expiration of amortization for prior acquisitions 

total amortization expense of purchased intangible assets was 1585 million in fiscal 2014 of which 829 million was recorded in cost of sales and 756 million was recorded in operating expenses total amortization expense of purchased intangibles represented 66 of revenue in fiscal 2014 a decrease of 43 million from fiscal 2013 when it represented 71 of revenue the decrease was primarily due to the expiration of amortization for prior acquisitions partially offset by acquisitions not included in fiscal 2013 

nonoperating income expense net 

the following table shows nonoperating income net for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

  

total nonoperating income expense net decreased by 78 million  during fiscal 2015  compared with fiscal 2014  the decrease was primarily due to higher interest expense and a gain on a partial equity sale of virtual site solutions vss included in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 partially offset by the impact of foreign currency transaction fluctuations and increased income from equity method investments due to joint venture profitability 

total nonoperating income expense net increased by 40 million during fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 the increase was primarily due to a gain on a partial equity sale of virtual site solutions included in other income loss net partially offset by lower profitability from joint ventures and the impact of foreign currency transaction fluctuations 

income tax provision 

our effective income tax rates for fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  were 20 20 and 14 respectively the fiscal 2015 rate was less than the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the geographical mix of our pretax income and to a lesser extent the inclusion of the current year us federal rd credit the fiscal 2014 rate was less than the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the geographical mix of our pretax income and to a lesser extent the inclusion of the current year us federal rd credit partially offset by the effect of a gain on a partial equity sale of vss the fiscal 2013 rate was less than the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the geographical mix of our pretax income and to a lesser extent the inclusion of the current year us federal rd credit the favorable benefit of the retroactive reinstatement of the 2012 rd credit and the benefit of the tax rate reduction in finland 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than operating leases inventory purchases and other commitments incurred in the normal course of business see contractual obligations table below we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities guarantee contracts retained or contingent interests in transferred assets or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity we do not have any majorityowned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements additionally we do not have any interest in or relationship with any special purpose entities 

in the normal course of business to facilitate sales of its products we indemnify other parties including customers lessors and parties to other transactions with us with respect to certain matters we have agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties these agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents 

it is not possible to determine the maximum potential exposure under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under these agreements have not been material and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on the consolidated balance sheets at the end of fiscal 2015 and 2014 

liquidity and capital resources 

  



cash and cash equivalents 

at the end of fiscal 2015  cash and cash equivalents totaled 1160 million  compared to 1480 million at the end of fiscal 2014  we had a principal balance of outstanding debt of 7352 million at the end of fiscal 2015  compared to 7416 million  at the end of fiscal 2014  

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents together with borrowings under our 2014 credit facility as described below under the heading “debt” will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs debt service planned capital expenditures acquisitions and stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program for at least the next twelve months 

we anticipate that planned capital expenditures primarily for enhancements of our oracle erp systems computer equipment software manufacturing tools and test equipment and leasehold improvements associated with business expansion will constitute 

a partial use of our cash resources decisions related to how much cash is used for investing are influenced by the expected amount of cash to be provided by operations 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 3549 million  for fiscal 2015  as compared to 4071 million  for fiscal 2014  the decrease of 522 million  was due to a decrease in net income before noncash depreciation and amortization primarily due to decreased operating income in engineering and construction and to a lesser extent field solutions this was partially offset by a decrease in working capital requirements particularly for inventory 

cash provided by operating activities was 4071 million for fiscal 2014 as compared to 4146 million for fiscal 2013 the decrease of 75 million was due to a decrease in net income before noncash depreciation and amortization primarily due to decreased operating income in field solutions this was partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 1724 million  for fiscal 2015  as compared to 3440 million for fiscal 2014  the decrease is primarily due to cash used for business and intangible asset acquisitions fiscal 2015 acquisitions included pocketmobile and vianova systems and other acquisitions fiscal 2014 acquisitions included manhattan software amtech and other acquisitions 

cash used in investing activities was 3440 million for fiscal 2014 as compared to 3248 million for fiscal 2013 the increase is primarily due to cash used for business and intangible asset acquisitions fiscal 2014 acquisitions included manhattan software amtech and other acquisitions fiscal 2013 acquisitions included alk trade services and other acquisitions 

financing activities 

cash used by financing activities was 2028 million  for fiscal 2015  as compared to cash used of 515 million during fiscal 2014  the increase of 1513 million  was primarily due to an increase in cash used for stock repurchases 

cash used by financing activities was 515 million for fiscal 2014 as compared to cash used of 984 million during fiscal 2013 the decrease of 469 million was primarily due to a decrease in debt proceeds net of repayments slightly offset by an increase in proceeds received from the issuance of common stock related to stock option exercises and stock repurchases 

accounts receivable and inventory metrics 

  

accounts receivable days sales outstanding were up at 59 days at the end of fiscal 2015  as compared to 58 days at the end of fiscal 2014  primarily due to the impact of acquisitions during the year our accounts receivable days sales outstanding are calculated based on ending accounts receivable net divided by revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter times a quarterly average of 91 days our inventory turns were 40 at the end of fiscal 2015 as compared to 39 at the end of fiscal 2014 our inventory turnover is based on the total cost of sales for the fiscal period over the average inventory for the corresponding fiscal period 

debt 

notes 

on october 30 2014 we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission “sec” for the issuance of senior debt securities on november 24 2014 we issued 4000 million of senior notes “notes” under the shelf registration statement the notes mature on december 1 2024 and accrue interest at a rate of 475 per annum payable semiannually in arrears on december 1 and june 1 of each year beginning on june 1 2015 the notes are classified as longterm in the consolidated balance sheet 

prior to september 1 2024 we may redeem the notes at our option at any time in whole or in part at a redemption price equal to the greater of i 100  of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed and ii the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of interest and principal calculated on a semiannual basis using a discount rate equal to the us treasury rate plus 40 basis points after september 1 2024 we may redeem the notes at our option at any time in whole or in part at a redemption price equal to 100  of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon in addition in the event of a change of control as defined in the prospectus filed with the sec each 

holder of the notes will have the right to require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of such holder’s notes at a purchase price equal to 101  of the principal amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest 

in connection with the closing of the notes offering we entered into an indenture with us bank national association as trustee the indenture contains covenants limiting our ability to create certain liens enter into sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate or merge with or into or convey transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to another person each subject to certain exceptions we were in compliance with these covenants at the end of fiscal 2015 the notes contain no financial covenants 

2014 credit facility 

on november 24 2014 we entered into a new fiveyear credit agreement with a group of lenders the “2014 credit facility” which replaced our previous 2012 credit facility the 2014 credit facility provides for an unsecured revolving loan facility of 10 billion subject to the terms of the 2014 credit facility the revolving loan facility may be increased andor term loan facilities may be established in an amount up to 5000 million the outstanding balance of 2160 million  is classified as longterm in the consolidated balance sheet 

the funds available under the 2014 credit facility may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes stock repurchases and the financing of certain acquisitions under the 2014 credit facility we may borrow repay and reborrow funds under the revolving loan facility until its maturity on november 24 2019 at which time the revolving facility will terminate and all outstanding loans together with all accrued and unpaid interest must be repaid amounts not borrowed under the 10 billion revolving facility will be subject to a commitment fee to be paid in arrears on the last day of each fiscal quarter ranging from 010 to 030 per annum depending on either our credit rating at such time or our leverage ratio as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter whichever results in more favorable pricing to us 

we may borrow funds under the 2014 credit facility in us dollars euros or in certain other agreed currencies and borrowings will bear interest at our option at either i a floating per annum base rate determined by reference to the highest of a the administrative agent’s prime rate b 050 per annum above the federal funds effective rate and c reserveadjusted libor for an interest period of one month plus 100 plus a margin of between 000 and 075 or ii a reserveadjusted fixed per annum rate based on libor or euribor depending on the currency borrowed plus a margin of between 100 and 175 the applicable margin in each case is determined based on either trimble’s credit rating at such time or trimble’s leverage ratio as of its most recently ended fiscal quarter whichever results in more favorable pricing to us interest is payable on the last day of each fiscal quarter with respect to borrowings bearing interest at the base rate or on the last day of an interest period but at least every three months with respect to borrowings bearing interest at libor or euribor rate 

the 2014 credit facility contains various customary representations and warranties by us which include customary use of materiality material adverse effect and knowledge qualifiers the 2014 credit facility also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including among other requirements negative covenants that restrict our ability to create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions and that restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to incur indebtedness further the 2014 credit facility contains financial covenants that require the maintenance of minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios specifically we must maintain as of the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of a ebitda as defined in the 2014 credit facility to b interest expense for the most recently ended period of four fiscal quarters of not less than 350 to 100 we must also maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of x total indebtedness as defined in the 2014 credit facility to y ebitda as defined in the 2014 credit facility for the most recently ended period of four fiscal quarters of not greater than 300 to 100 provided that on the completion of a material acquisition we may increase the ratio by 050 for the fiscal quarter during which such acquisition occurred and each of the three subsequent fiscal quarters we were in compliance with these covenants at the end of fiscal 2015 

the 2014 credit facility contains events of default that include among others nonpayment of principal interest or fees breach of covenants inaccuracy of representations and warranties cross defaults to certain other indebtedness bankruptcy and insolvency events material judgments and events constituting a change of control upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default interest on the obligations will accrue at an increased rate and the lenders may accelerate our obligations under the 2014 credit facility except that acceleration will be automatic in the case of bankruptcy and insolvency events of default 

the interest rate on the longterm debt outstanding under the credit facilities was 146  and 142 at the end of fiscal 2015 and 2014 respectively 

uncommitted facilities 

we also have two 75 million revolving credit facilities which are uncommitted the “uncommitted facilities” the uncommitted facilities may be called by the lenders at any time have no covenants and no specified expiration date the interest rate on the uncommitted facilities is 100  plus either libor or the bank’s cost of funds or as otherwise agreed upon by the bank and us 

the 1180 million  outstanding at the end of 2015 and the 570 million  outstanding at the end of 2014 under the uncommitted facilities are classified as shortterm in our consolidated balance sheet the weighted average interest rate on the uncommitted facilities was 137  at the end of fiscal 2015 and 115  at the end of fiscal 2014 

for additional discussion of our debt see note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

repatriation of foreign earnings and income taxes 

at the end of fiscal 2015 956 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries of which 290 million was borrowed from the us under intercompany financing arrangements if these loaned funds are needed for our operations in the us we would not be required to accrue and pay us federal and state taxes to repatriate the loaned funds we expect that over the next two quarters these intercompany financing arrangements will be repaid and after such repayment we would be required to pay us federal and state taxes upon any repatriation of remaining cash held by our foreign subsidiaries while a significant portion of our foreign earnings continue to be permanently reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries it is anticipated this reinvestment will not impede cash needs at the parent company level however if we were to make significant acquisitions or stock repurchases we may be required to increase our outstanding indebtedness which could result in increased borrowing costs in our determination of which foreign earnings are permanently reinvested we consider numerous factors including the financial requirements of the us parent company the financial requirements of the foreign subsidiaries and the tax consequences of remitting the foreign earnings back to the us there are no other material impediments to our ability to access sources of liquidity and our resulting ability to meet short and longterm liquidity needs other than in the event we are not in compliance with the covenants under our 2014 credit facility or the potential tax costs of remitting foreign earnings back to the us 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at the end of fiscal 2015 

  



  

 at the end of fiscal 2015 we had unrecognized tax benefits included in other noncurrent liabilities of 531 million  including interest and penalties at this time we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with tax authorities regarding this liability and therefore such amounts are not included in the contractual obligations table above 

effect of new accounting pronouncements 

the impact of recent accounting pronouncements is disclosed in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

reconciliation of gaap to nongaap financial measures 

our nongaap measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap measures the nongaap financial measures included in the following tables as well as detailed explanations to the adjustments to comparable gaap measures are set forth below 

nongaap gross margin 

we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap gross margin as a way of understanding how product mix pricing decisions and manufacturing costs influence our business nongaap gross margin excludes restructuring costs amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation and amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup from gaap gross margin we believe that these exclusions offer investors additional information that may be useful to view trends in our gross margin performance 

nongaap operating expenses 

we believe this measure is important to investors evaluating our nongaap spending in relation to revenue nongaap operating expenses exclude restructuring costs amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation acquisitiondivestiture costs associated with external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition activities such as legal due diligence integration costs and litigation expense from gaap operating expenses we believe that these exclusions offer investors supplemental information to facilitate comparison of our operating expenses to our prior results 

nongaap operating income 

we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap operating income trends which are driven by revenue gross margin and spending nongaap operating income excludes restructuring costs amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisitiondivestiture costs associated with external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition activities such as legal due diligence integration costs and litigation expenses we believe that these exclusions offer an alternative means for our investors to evaluate current operating performance compared to results of other periods 

nongaap nonoperating income expense net 

we believe this measure helps investors evaluate our nonoperating income trends nongaap nonoperating income expense net excludes acquisition and divestiture gainslosses associated with unusual acquisition related items such as intangible asset impairment charges and gains or losses related to the acquisition or sale of certain businesses and investments and an equity sale gain these gainslosses are specific to particular acquisitions and divestitures and vary significantly in amount and timing nongaap nonoperating income expense net also excludes debt issuance cost writeoffs associated with terminated andor modified credit facilities and costs associated with the issuance of new credit facilities and senior notes that were not capitalized as debt issuance costs we believe that these exclusions provide investors with a supplemental view of our ongoing financial results 

nongaap income tax provision 

we believe that providing investors with the nongaap income tax provision is beneficial because it provides for consistent treatment of the excluded items in our nongaap presentation in fiscal 2015 we began calculating a nongaap tax rate separate from the gaap rate as we expect this to add consistency in the nongaap trends the nongaap income tax provision excludes material nonrecurring items such as build and release of valuation allowances reserve releases related to closure of tax audits and other nonrecurring items we have not retroactively restated prior periods’ nongaap results with a similar separate rate therefore comparability between periods may be affected 

nongaap net income 

this measure provides a supplemental view of net income trends which are driven by nongaap income before taxes and our nongaap tax rate nongaap net income excludes restructuring costs amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisition and divestiture costs litigation an equity sale gain debt issuance cost writeoffs and nongaap tax adjustments from gaap net income we believe our investors benefit from understanding these exclusions and from an alternative view of our net income performance as compared to our past net income performance 

nongaap diluted net income per share 

we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap operating performance as reflected in a per share calculation as a way of measuring nongaap operating performance by ownership in the company nongaap diluted net income per share excludes restructuring costs amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisition and divestiture costs litigation an equity sale gain debt issuance cost writeoffs and nongaap tax adjustments from gaap diluted net income per share we believe that these exclusions offer investors a useful view of our diluted net income per share as compared to our past diluted net income per share 

nongaap operating leverage 

we believe this information is beneficial to investors as a measure of how much incremental revenue contributed to our operating income nongaap operating leverage is the increase in nongaap operating income as a percentage of the increase in revenue we believe that this information offers investors supplemental information to evaluate our current performance and to compare to our past nongaap operating leverage 

these nongaap measures can be used to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance as well as our performance relative to competitors we believe some of our investors track our core operating performance as a means of evaluating our performance in the ordinary ongoing and customary course of our operations core operating performance excludes items that are noncash not expected to recur or not reflective of ongoing financial results management also believes that looking at our core operating performance provides a supplemental way to provide consistency in period to period comparisons accordingly management excludes from nongaap those items relating to restructuring amortization of purchased intangible assets stock based compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisition and divestiture items litigation a gain on an equity sale writeoff of debt issuance costs and nongaap tax adjustments for detailed explanations of the adjustments made to comparable gaap measures see items a   m below 







 

 50 

expenses that are not indicative of our ongoing operating results we further believe that excluding these items from our nongaap results is useful to investors in that it allows for periodoverperiod comparability     

 

nongaap operating income 

nongaap operating income decreased by 899 million  for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 and increased by 60 million for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 nongaap operating income as a percentage of total revenue was 170  200 and 207 for fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

the nongaap operating income and nongaap operating income percentage for fiscal 2015 decreased primarily due to revenue declines in engineering and construction and field solutions partially offset by a revenue increase in mobile solutions the increase in nongaap operating income for 2014 was primarily due to a revenue increase in engineering and construction and mobile solutions partially offset by revenue decrease in field solutions and the impact of acquisitions in engineering and construction the decrease of nongaap operating income percentage for 2014 was primarily due to a revenue decrease in field solutions and the impact of acquisitions in engineering and construction

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors 

market interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds treasury bills interest and noninterest bearing bank deposits as well as bank time deposits the main objective of these instruments is safety of principal and liquidity while maximizing return without significantly increasing risk 

due to the shortterm nature of our cash equivalents we do not anticipate any material effect on our portfolio due to fluctuations in interest rates 

we are exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing interest rates under our credit facilities our 2014 credit facility is comprised of a revolving credit agreement and a letter of credit subfacility with maturity dates of november 24 2019 and also two unsecured uncommitted revolving credit agreements that are callable by the bank at any time we may borrow funds under these facilities in us dollars or in certain other currencies and borrowings will bear interest as described under note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 at the end of fiscal 2015 we had outstanding a revolving loan of 2160 million  under the 2014 credit facility and a revolving credit line of 1180 million  under the uncommitted facilities a hypothetical 10 increase in our borrowing rates at the end of fiscal 2015 could result in approximately 02 million annual increase in interest expense on these existing principal balances 

the hypothetical changes and assumptions made above will be different from what actually occurs in the future furthermore the computations do not anticipate actions that may be taken by our management should the hypothetical market changes actually occur over time as a result actual earnings effects in the future will differ from those quantified above 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we operate in international markets which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and various foreign currencies the most significant of which is the euro 

historically the majority of our revenue contracts are denominated in us dollars with the most significant exception being europe where we invoice primarily in euros additionally a portion of our expenses primarily the cost to manufacture cost of personnel to deliver technical support on our products and professional services sales and sales support and research and development are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the euro 

revenue resulting from selling in local currencies and costs incurred in local currencies are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which can affect our operating income as exchange rates vary operating income may differ from expectations in fiscal 2015 revenue and operating income were negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange rates by 923 million and 54 million respectively currency translation subtracted approximately 4 of revenue and 3 of operating income in fiscal 2015 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash and certain trade and intercompany receivables and payables primarily denominated in swiss franc euro british pound and new zealand and canadian dollars these contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rate movements as the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses on the forward contracts these instruments are marked to market through earnings every period and generally range from one to two months in maturity we do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes we occasionally enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase price of some of our larger business acquisitions foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at the end of fiscal 2015 and 2014 are summarized as follows in millions

in 2014 we introduced a new cloudbased platform for field service management called trimble horizon trimble horizon offers customers an extensible platform allowing them to rely on trimble as a single provider for all their mobile worker needs 

the mobile solutions segment generally sells directly to endusers sales cycles tend to be long due to field trials followed by an extensive decisionmaking process key competitors in this segment include omnitracs fleetmatics teletrac and mcleod among others we compete principally on the basis of interconnectedness customer support and service price innovative product offerings quality and provision of a complete solution 

a dvanced devices 

advanced devices includes the product lines from our embedded technologies timing applanix trimble outdoors military and advanced systems mas and thingmagic businesses with the exception of trimble outdoors and applanix these businesses share several common characteristics they are hardware centric generally market to oems system integrators and service providers and have products that can be utilized in a number of different end user markets and applications the various operations that comprise this segment were aggregated on the basis that these operations taken as a whole do not exceed 10 of our total revenue operating income or assets 

within embedded technologies and timing we supply gnss modules licensing and complementary technologies and gnssintegrated subsystem solutions for applications requiring precise position time or frequency embedded technologies and timing serve a broad range of vertical markets including telecommunications automotive electronics and commercial electronics sales are made directly to oems system integrators valueadded resellers and service providers who incorporate our components into

patents licenses and intellectual property 

we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate we hold approximately 1100 unique issued and enforceable patents the majority of which cover gnss based technologies and other applications such as optical and laser technology we are not dependent on any one patent we also own numerous trademarks and service marks that contribute to the identity and recognition of trimble and its products and services globally we prefer to own the intellectual property used in our products either directly or through subsidiaries from time to time we license technology from third parties 

competition 

our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future within each of our markets we encounter direct competition from other gnss software optical and laser suppliers such as hexagon and topcon and competition may intensify from various larger us and nonus competitors our hardware products are increasingly subject to competition from existing and new entrants from emerging markets such as china which compete aggressively on price at the lower priced end of the market our integrated hardware and software products may also be subject to increasing competition from mass market devices such as smartphones and tablets combined with relatively inexpensive applications which have not been heavily used for commercial applications in the past 

many of our products and solutions are focused on specific industries in each of these industries we face competition from companies providing point solutions or more traditional less technology intensive products and services which often have greater financial resources and more established and recognized brands in those industries competing in vertical markets with these more established industry participants requires that we successfully establish a market position and market new and sometimes unfamiliar technology and automated solutions to customers that have not previously used such products we also increasingly offer enterprise level solutions designed to meet the specific needs of our target industries in doing so we face competition from larger and more well established providers of enterprise software and services with whom we have not previously competed see also risk factors  we face substantial competition in our markets which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition 

sales and marketing 

we tailor our distribution to the needs of our products and regional markets around the world most of our products are sold worldwide primarily through indirect channels including distributors dealers and authorized representatives occasionally we grant exclusive rights to market certain products within specific countries these channels are supported by our regional sales offices throughout the world we also utilize distribution alliances oem relationships and joint ventures with other companies as a means to serve selected markets as well as direct sales to endusers 

during fiscal 2014 sales to customers in the united states represented 48 europe represented 24 asia pacific represented 14 and other regions represented 14 of our total revenue 

seasonality of business 

construction purchases tend to occur in early spring and us governmental agencies tend to utilize funds available at the end of the government’s fiscal year for additional purchases at the end of our third fiscal quarter in september of each year our agricultural equipment business revenues have historically been the highest in the first quarter followed by the second quarter reflecting buying in anticipation of the spring planting season in the northern hemisphere however overall as a company as a result of diversification of our business across segments and the increased impact of subscription revenues we may experience less seasonality in the future 

backlog 

in most of our markets the time between order placement and shipment is short orders are generally placed by resellers and customers on an asneeded basis in general customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty for these reasons we do not believe that backlog is a meaningful indicator of future revenue or material to understanding our business   

manufacturing 

manufacturing of many of our gnss products is subcontracted to flextronics international limited in mexico we utilize flextronics for survey field solutions and mobile solutions products we utilize benchmark electronics inc in china for our embedded technologies and timing products we utilize jabil mexico for our construction and mobile solutions products our contract manufacturing partners are responsible for significant material procurement assembly and testing we continue to manage product design through pilot production for the subcontracted products and we are directly involved in qualifying suppliers and key components used in all our products our current contract with flextronics continues in effect until either party gives the other ninety days written notice we also utilize original design manufacturers for some of our products 

we manufacture our laser and opticsbased products as well as some of our gnss products at our plants in dayton ohio danderyd sweden and shanghai china some of these products or portions of these products are also subcontracted to third parties for assembly 

our design manufacturing and distribution sites in dayton ohio sunnyvale california danderyd sweden eersel netherlands and shanghai china are registered to iso90012000 covering the design production distribution and servicing of all our products 

research and development 

we believe that our competitive position is maintained through the development and introduction of new products and services that incorporate improved features and functionality better performance smaller size and weight lower cost or some combination of these factors we invest substantially in the development of new products we also make significant investment in the positioning communication and information technologies that underlie our products and will likely provide competitive advantages 

our research and development expenditures net of reimbursed amounts were 3180 million for fiscal 2014 representing approximately 13 of revenue 

we expect to continue investing in research and development at a rate consistent with our past with the goal of maintaining or improving our competitive position and entering new markets 

employees 

at the end of fiscal 2014 we employed 8217 employees including 18 in manufacturing 33 in engineering 37 in sales and marketing and 12 in general and administrative positions approximately 53 of employees are in locations outside the united states 

some employees in sweden and finland are represented by unions some employees in germany and france are represented by works councils we also employ temporary and contract personnel that are not included in the above headcount numbers we have not experienced work stoppages or similar labor actions

risk factors 

tableend 

risks and uncertainties 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k and in any other documents to which we refer you in this form 10k before purchasing our securities the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate which could negatively impact our operations financial results and our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control results in any period could be affected by 

 seasonal variations in demand for our products may also affect our quarterly results construction purchases tend to occur in early spring and us governmental agencies tend to utilize funds available at the end of the government’s fiscal year for additional purchases at the end of our third fiscal quarter in september of each year our agricultural equipment business revenues have historically been the highest in the first quarter followed by the second quarter reflecting buying in anticipation of the spring planting season in the northern hemisphere if we do not accurately forecast seasonal demand we may be left with unsold inventory or have a shortage of inventory which could negatively impact our financial results 

due in part to the buying patterns of our customers a significant portion of our quarterly revenue occurs from orders received and immediately shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of each quarter while our operating expense tends to remain fairly predictable a majority of our sales force earns commissions on a quarterly basis which may cause concentrations of orders at the end of any fiscal quarter it could harm our operating results if for any reason expected sales are deferred orders are not received or shipments are delayed a few days at the end of a quarter 

the price of our common stock could decline substantially in the event such occurrences result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors which are based on historical models that are not necessarily accurate representations of the future 

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect an investment in our common stock 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile during fiscal 2014 our stock price ranged from 2651 to 3996 we believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate perhaps substantially including 

 in addition the stock market in general and the markets for shares of “hightech” companies in particular have frequently experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

global and regional economic conditions and the cyclicality of some of our key markets may negatively impact our businesses and our operating results 

our earnings and financial position are and will continue to be influenced by various macroeconomic factorsincluding increases or decreases in gross domestic product the level of consumer and business confidence changes in interest rates on consumer and business credit fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates energy prices and the cost of commodities such as cornwhich exist in the various countries in which we operate during 2014 we experienced a strengthening us dollar which had the impact of making some of our products and services more expensive than many of our local competitors 

in the recent past uncertainties in the financial and credit markets have caused our customers to postpone purchases and negative economic conditions may reduce future sales of or demand for our products and services negative economic conditions may depress the tax revenues of federal state and local government entities which are significant purchasers of our products many of our products are sold through dealer channels and our dealers depend on the availability of credit to finance purchases of our products for their inventory sources of credit could disappear or the financial situation of our channel partners and customers could become such that they are no longer eligible for such financing negative economic conditions may result in increased collection times or greater writeoffs affecting our cash flow our suppliers may be impacted by economic pressures which may adversely affect their ability to fulfill their obligations to us and therefore cause a disruption in our supply chain 

financial conditions in several regions continue to place significant economic pressures on existing and potential customers including our dealer channels there is particular concern about economic conditions in europe which has experienced negative impacts from sovereign debt levels and government taxing and spending actions to address such issues and pressures on the banking system in certain european union countries it is uncertain whether central bank or governmental measures will improve these conditions other governments may continue to implement measures which may slow the economic growth rate in those countries eg higher interest rates reduced bank lending and other antiinflation measures growth rates in key emerging markets including china have slowed which could affect demand for our products 

we are subject to the cyclicality of the agricultural and engineering and construction industries which can cause sudden and sometimes material declines in demand with negative effects on sales inventory levels and product pricing in general demand in the engineering and construction industries for our products is highly correlated to the economic cycle and can be subject to even greater levels of volatility the agricultural spending cycle is influenced by general economic conditions as well as weather crop loads commodity pricing especially corn the availability of credit and the strength of the us dollar in 2014 the agricultural sector experienced a significant downturn which is continuing which had a negative effect on the company’s overall growth rate 

if there is significant deterioration in the global economy the economies of key countries or regions or important customer markets the demand for our products and services would likely decrease and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected changes in economic conditions also make it difficult to make financial forecasts which could cause us to miss our financial guidance and adversely affect our stock price 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which can adversely affect our operating results 

fluctuations in currencies impact our operating results which are reported in us dollars a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the us and as such we face exposure to movements in nonus currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows during 2014 our business was negatively impacted by the strong us dollar which increased the cost of some of our products and services relative to those of local competitors in some jurisdictions if the us dollar remains strong or there is an increase in the exchange rate of the us dollar against other currencies it could negatively impact foreign demand for our products or reduce the dollar value of local currency sales possible import export tariff and other trade barriers which could be imposed by other countries might have a material adverse effect on the business 

currently we routinely hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the short term impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities our attempts to hedge against these risks could be unsuccessful and expose us to losses 

investing in and integrating new acquisitions could be costly place a significant strain on our management systems and resources and may fail to deliver the expected return on investment which could negatively impact our operating results 

we typically acquire a number of companies each year and intend to continue to acquire other companies acquisitions of companies entail numerous risks including 

 any such effects from acquisitions could be costly and place a significant strain on our management systems and resources 

as a result of acquisitions we have significant assets that include goodwill and other purchased intangibles the testing of this goodwill and intangibles for impairment under established accounting guidelines requires significant use of judgment and assumptions changes in business conditions could require negative adjustments to the valuation of these assets resulting in writeoffs which adversely affect our results if we divest a business and the proceeds are less than the net book value at the time we would be forced to write off the difference in addition losses incurred by a company in which we have an investment may have a direct impact on our financial statements or could result in our having to writedown the value of such investment 

even if successfully negotiated and closed acquisitions may not yield expected synergies may not advance our business strategy as expected may fall short of expected returnoninvestment targets or may not prove successful or effective for our business companies that we acquire may operate with different cost and margin structures which could further cause fluctuations in our operating results and adversely affect our operating margins 

we may not be able to enter into or maintain important alliances and distribution relationships 

we believe that in certain business opportunities our success will depend on our ability to form and maintain alliances with industry participants such as caterpillar nikon hilti and cnh global our failure to form and maintain such alliances or the preemption of such alliances by actions of competitors will adversely affect our ability to sell our products to customers our relationships with substantial industry participants such as caterpillar and cnh are complex and multifaceted and may be subject to change based upon the business needs and objectives of the parties since these strategic relationships contribute to significant ongoing business in certain of our important markets changes in these relationships could adversely affect our sales and revenues 

we utilize dealer networks including those affiliated with some of our strategic allies such as caterpillar and cnh global to market sell and service many of our products changes in our product mix including increasing provision of software and bundled solutions tailored to the needs of specific vertical markets impose new demands on our distribution channels and may require significant changes in the skills and expertise required to successfully distribute our products and services or the creation of new distribution channels recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in the use and the selling of our technology and product offerings requires significant time and resources in order to develop and expand our distribution channels we must continue to expand and improve our processes and procedures that support our channel including our investment in systems and training and those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and difficult to manage the time and expense required for sales and marketing organizations of our channel partners to become familiar with our product offerings including our new product developments and newer types of offering such as software and services may make it more difficult to introduce those products to endusers and delay enduser adoption which could result in lower revenues 

disruption of dealer coverage within specific geographic markets could cause difficulties in marketing selling or servicing our products and have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition moreover dealers who carry products that compete with our products may focus their inventory purchases and sales efforts on goods provided by competitors due to industry demand or profitability such inventory adjustments and sourcing decisions can adversely impact our sales financial condition and results of operations 

our internal and customer facing systems and systems of third parties we rely upon may be subject to disruption delays or cybersecurity breaches that could adversely impact our customers and operations 

a cybersecurity incident in our own systems or the systems of our third party providers may compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of our own internal data the availability of our products and websites designed to support our customers or our customer data computer hackers foreign governments or cyber terrorists may attempt to penetrate our network security and our website unauthorized access to our proprietary business information or customer data may be obtained through breakins sabotage breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks employee theft or misuse breach of the security of the networks of our third party providers or other misconduct because the techniques used by computer hackers who may attempt to penetrate and sabotage our network security or our website change frequently and may not be recognized until after they have been launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques it is also possible that unauthorized access to customer data may be obtained through inadequate use of security controls by customers a cybersecurity incident affecting our systems may also result in theft of our intellectual property proprietary data or trade secrets which would compromise our competitive position 

the systems we rely upon also remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from a number of other factors including access to the internet the failure of our network or software systems or significant variability in visitor traffic on our product websites earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunication failures computer viruses human error and similar events or disruptions some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities our systems are also subject to intentional acts of vandalism despite any precautions we may take the occurrence of a natural disaster a decision by any of our thirdparty hosting providers to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could cause system interruptions and delays and result in loss of critical data and lengthy interruptions in our services 

we rely on our information systems and those of third parties for activities such as processing customer orders delivery of products hosting and providing services and support to our customers billing and tracking our customers hosting and managing our customer data and otherwise running our business any disruptions or unexpected incompatibilities in our information systems and those of the third parties upon whom we rely could have a significant impact on our business 

an increasing portion of our revenue comes from software as a service solutions and other hosted services in which we store retrieve communicate and manage data which is critical to our customers’ business systems disruption of our systems which support these services and solutions could cause disruptions in our customers’ systems and in the businesses that rely on these systems any such disruptions could harm our reputation create liabilities to our customers hurt demand for our services and solutions and negatively impact our revenues and profitability 

our products are highly technical and may contain undetected errors product defects security vulnerabilities or software errors which could result in damage to our reputation lost revenue diverted development resources and increased service costs warranty claims and litigation 

our products including our software products are highly technical and complex and when deployed may contain errors defects or security vulnerabilities we must develop our products quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing market and we have a history of frequently introducing new products products and services as sophisticated as ours could contain undetected errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new models or versions are released such occurrences could result in damage to our reputation lost revenue diverted development resources increased customer service and support costs warranty claims and litigation 

we warrant that our products will be free of defect for various periods of time depending on the product in addition certain of our contracts include epidemic failure clauses if invoked these clauses may entitle the customer to return or obtain credits for products and inventory or to cancel outstanding purchase orders even if the products themselves are not defective 

errors viruses or bugs may be present in software that we license from third parties and incorporate into our products or in third party software that our customers use in conjunction with our software our customers’ proprietary software and network firewall protections may corrupt data from our products and create difficulties in implementing our solutions changes to third party software that our customers use in conjunction with our software could also render our applications inoperable any errors defects or security vulnerabilities in our products or any defects in or compatibility issues with any third party software or customers’ network environments discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition loss of customers theft of trade secrets data or intellectual property and increased service and warranty cost any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products alone or in combination with third party software could expose them to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses and other malicious software programs that could attack our products actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could harm our reputation and lead some customers to return products to reduce or delay future purchases or use competitive products 

if we are unable to effectively manage our increasingly diverse and complex businesses and operations our ability to generate growth and revenue from new or existing customers may be adversely affected 

because our operations are geographically diverse and increasingly complex our personnel resources and infrastructure could become strained and our reputation in the market and our ability to successfully manage and grow our business may be adversely affected the size complexity and diverse nature of our business and the expansion of our product lines and customer base have placed increased demands on our management and operations and further growth if any may place additional strains on our resources in the future our ability to effectively compete and to manage our planned future growth will depend on among other things the following 

 the company has increasingly diversified the nature of its businesses both organically and by acquisition as a result an increasing amount of our business involves business models which require managerial techniques and skill sets which are different from those required to manage our historical core businesses we are increasingly selling products and solutions directly to large enterprise customers and other end users of our products a direct sales model requires different skills and management processes and procedures from those we have generally used in our business in the past and may create conflicts with our channel partners an increasing portion of our business will be associated with professional services in order to customize our solutions for the needs of individual customers which has not previously represented a significant portion of our business if we are not successful in executing on these new models our sales and revenue may suffer 

changes in our software and subscription businesses may negatively affect our operating results 

an increasing portion of our revenue is generated through software maintenance and subscription revenue our customers have no obligation to renew their agreements for our software maintenance or subscription services after the expiration of their initial contract period which typically range from one to five years our customer acquisition and renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including overall economic conditions the health of their businesses competitive offerings and customer dissatisfaction with our services if customers do not renew their contracts for our products our maintenance and subscription revenue will decline and our financial results will suffer any reduction in the number of licenses that we sell even if our customer acquisition rates do not change will have a negative impact on our future maintenance revenue growth since its introduction our software as a service delivery model has also contributed to subscription revenue if any of our assumptions about expenses revenue or revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect or our attempts to improve efficiency are not successful our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated and our financial results will be negatively impacted 

we continually reevaluate our software licensing programs and subscription renewal programs including specific license models delivery methods and terms and conditions changes to our licensing programs and subscription renewal programs including the timing of the release of enhancements upgrades maintenance releases the term of the contract discounts promotions and other factors could impact the timing of the recognition of revenue for our products related enhancements and services and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition we may implement different licensing models which require the company to recognize licensing fees over a longer period over the last few years we have increasingly offered additional products in a software as a service saas model saas revenues are recognized ratably over the subscription period any significant increase in the percentage of our business generated from such a subscription model could increase the amount of revenue to be recognized over time as opposed to upfront which would delay revenue recognition and have a negative impact on our operating results in any quarterly period due to these complexities associated with revenue recognition we may not be able to accurately forecast our nondeferred and deferred revenues which could cause us to miss our earnings estimates or revenue projections and negatively impact our stock price 

we face substantial competition in our markets which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition 

our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price quality and performance of our products the effectiveness of our distribution channel and direct sales force the level of customer service the development of new technology and our ability to participate in emerging markets within each of our markets we encounter direct competition from other gnss software optical and laser suppliers and competition may intensify from various larger us and nonus competitors and new market entrants particularly from emerging markets such as china our products which commonly use gnss for basic location information may be subject to competition from alternative location technologies such as simultaneous location and mapping 

technology  as we sell an increasing amount of software and subscription services we face competition from a group of large well established companies with whom we have not previously competed our integrated hardware and software products may be subject to increasing competition from mass market devices such as smartphones and tablets used in conjunction with relatively inexpensive applications which have not been heavily used for commercial applications in the past these developments may require us to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes that we have not previously been exposed to including those related to cloud computing mobile devices and new computing platforms such competition has in the past resulted and in the future may result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the future against existing and additional competitors will depend largely on our ability to execute our strategy to provide products with significantly differentiated features compared to currently available products we may not be able to implement this strategy successfully and our products may not be competitive with other technologies or products that may be developed by our competitors many of whom have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing sales and other resources than we do 

we are dependent on new products and services and if we are unable to successfully introduce them into the market or to effectively compete with new disruptive product alternatives our customer base may decline or fail to grow as anticipated 

our future revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to bring new products and services to market on a timely basis we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products and services enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance of such products and services we may incur problems in the future in innovating and introducing new products and services our development stage products may not be successfully completed or if developed may not achieve significant customer acceptance development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and we might not achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success if we are unable to introduce new products and services if other companies develop competing technology products and services or if we do not develop compelling new products and services our number of customers may not grow as anticipated or may decline which could harm our operating results many of our offerings are increasingly focused on software and subscription services the software industry is characterized by rapidly changing customer preferences which require us to address multiple delivery platforms new mobile devices and cloud computing life cycles of software products can be short and this can exacerbate the risks associated with developing new products the introduction of thirdparty solutions embodying new disruptive technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could make our existing and future software solutions and other products obsolete or noncompetitive if we are not able to develop software and other solutions that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers or if we are unable to adapt to new technologies or new industry standards that impact our markets our ability to retain or increase market share and revenues could be materially adversely affected 

some of our products rely on third party technologies including open source software so if integration or incompatibility issues arise with these technologies or these technologies become unavailable our product and services development may be delayed our reputation could be harmed and our business could be adversely affected 

we license software technologies and intellectual property underlying some of our software from third parties the third party licenses we rely upon may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all and the software and technologies may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors resulting in development delays some software licenses are subject to annual renewals at the discretion of the licensors in many cases if we were to breach a provision of these license agreements the licensor could terminate the agreement immediately the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such third party software or technology could result in increased costs or delays in software releases or updates until such issues have been resolved this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and future prospects 

we also incorporate open source software into our products although we monitor our use of open source the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market or sell our products or to develop new products in such event we could be required to seek licenses from thirdparties in order to continue offering our products to disclose and offer royaltyfree licenses in connection with our own source code to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis any of which could adversely affect our business 

we are dependent on proprietary technology which could result in litigation that could divert significant valuable resources 

our future success and competitive position is dependent upon our proprietary technology and we rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright law to protect our intellectual property the patents owned or licensed by us may be invalidated circumvented infringed and challenged the rights granted under these patents may not provide competitive advantages to us any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us if at all 

despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain our software or develop software with the same functionality or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology duplicate our technology or design around the patents owned by us in addition effective copyright patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in certain countries the steps taken by us to protect our technology might not prevent the misappropriation of such technology 

the value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many current patent filings thirdparties may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights for example individuals and groups may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from us or our customers the number of these claims has increased in recent periods and may continue to increase in the future as new patents are issued or are brought to our attention by the holders of such patents it may be necessary for us to withdraw products from the market secure a license from such patent holders or redesign our products in addition the legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant expense of operations any such litigation could require us to incur substantial costs and divert significant valuable resources including the efforts of our technical and management personnel which harm our results of operations and financial condition 

our global operations expose us to risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally and our results of operations may be adversely affected by our efforts to comply with us laws which apply to international operations such as the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and us export control laws as well as the laws of other countries 

we operate on a global basis with offices or activities in europe africa asia south america australasia and north america we face risks inherent in conducting business internationally including compliance with international and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations these laws and regulations include data privacy requirements labor relations laws tax laws anticompetition regulations import and trade restrictions export control laws and laws which prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers many of our products are subject to us export law restrictions that limit the destinations and types of customers to which our products may be sold or require an export license in connection with sales outside the united states given the high level of complexity of these laws there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently or intentionally breached for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise also we may be held liable for actions taken by our local dealers and partners violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees and prohibitions on the conduct of our business any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our operating results 

in addition we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced significant governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices we may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence or through other methods that us law and regulations prohibit us from using our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties 

in addition to the foregoing engaging in international business inherently involves a number of other difficulties and risks including 

 

these factors or any combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue or our overall financial performance 

we are dependent on a specific manufacturer and assembler for many of our products and on other manufacturers and specific suppliers of critical parts for our products 

we are substantially dependent upon flextronics international limited as our preferred manufacturing partner for many of our gnss products under the agreement we provide to flextronics a twelvemonth product forecast and place purchase orders with 

flextronics at least thirty calendar days in advance of the scheduled delivery of products to our customers depending on production lead time although purchase orders placed with flextronics are cancelable the terms of the agreement would require us to purchase from flextronics all inventory not returnable or usable by other flextronics customers accordingly if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products we may be unable to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity from flextronics to meet customers’ delivery requirements or we may accumulate excess inventories if such inventories are not usable by other flextronics customers our current contract with flextronics continues in effect until either party gives the other ninety days written notice 

we rely on specific suppliers for a number of our critical components and on other contract manufacturers including benchmark electronics and jabil for the manufacture test and assembly of certain products and components we have experienced shortages of components in the past our current reliance on specific or a limited group of suppliers and contract manufacturers involves risks including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components reduced control over pricing and delivery schedules discontinuation of certain components and economic conditions which may adversely impact the viability of our suppliers and contract manufacturers this situation may be exacerbated during any period of economic recovery or a competitive environment any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture assemble and test such components internally could significantly delay our ability to ship our products which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our reputation and brand as well as our operating results 

we are dependent on the availability and unimpaired use of allocated bands within the radio frequency spectrum and our products may be subject to harmful interference from new or modified spectrum uses 

our gnss technology is dependent on the use of satellite signals and on terrestrial communication bands international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union itu a specialized technical agency of the united nations these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference each country also has regulatory authority over how each band is used in the country in the united states the federal communications commission fcc and the national telecommunications and information administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations 

any itu or local reallocation of radio frequency bands including frequency band segmentation and sharing of spectrum or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our customers both of which could reduce demand for our products for example the fcc has been considering proposals to repurpose spectrum adjacent to the gps bands for terrestrial broadband wireless operations throughout the united states if the fcc were to permit implementation of such proposals or similar proposals terrestrial broadband wireless operations could create harmful interference to gps receivers within range of such operations and impose costs to retrofit or replace affected receivers similarly other countries have considered proposals for use of frequencies used by our products as well as adjacent bands that could cause harmful interference to our products 

many of our products use other radio frequency bands such as the public land mobile radio bands together with the gnss signal to provide enhanced gnss capabilities such as realtime kinematics precision the continuing availability of these nongnss radio frequencies is essential to provide enhanced gnss products to our precision survey agriculture and construction machine controls markets in addition transmissions and emissions from other services and equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or inband may impair the utility and reliability of our products any regulatory changes in spectrum allocation or in allowable operating conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

many of our products rely on gnss technology gps and other satellite systems which may become degraded or inoperable and result in lost revenue 

gnss technology gps satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible intentional disruption many of the gps satellites currently in orbit were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of 30 operational satellites in orbit five have been in operation for more than 15 years and over half have been in use for more than 75 years repair of damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites a reduction in the number of operating satellites below the 24satellite standard established for gps may impair the utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities in addition software updates to gps satellites and ground control segments can cause problems and we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of such updates to mitigate these problems 

as the principal gnss currently in operation we are dependent on continued operation of gps the gps constellation is operated by the u s government which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps if supporting policies were to change or if user fees were imposed it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

many of our products also use signals from systems that augment gps such as the wide area augmentation system and national differential gps system and satellites transmitting signal corrections data on mobile satellite services frequencies utilized by our rtx corrections services some of these augmentation systems are operated by the us government and rely on continued funding and maintenance of these systems any curtailment of the operating capability of these systems or limitations on access to or use of the signals or discontinuance of service could result in degradation of our services or product performance with an adverse effect on our business 

many of our products use satellite signals from the russian glonass system other countries including china and india are in the process of creating their own gnss systems and we either have developed or will develop products which use gnss signals from these systems the european community is developing an independent radio navigation satellite system known as galileo national or european authorities may provide preferential access to signals to companies associated with their markets including our competitors which could harm our competitive position if we are unable to develop timely and competitive commercial products using these systems or obtain timely and equal access to service signals this could result in lost revenue these authorities may also adopt protectionist measures favoring national companies who make use of their gnss systems to the detriment of trimble products using the us gps system which would harm our business 

we are subject to the impact of governmental and other similar certifications processes and regulations which could adversely affect our products and our business 

we market certain products that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold for example ce certification for radiated emissions is required for most gnss receiver and data communications products sold in the european community in the future us governmental authorities may propose gps receiver testing and certification for compliance with published gps signal interface or other specifications an inability to obtain any such certifications in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our operating results governmental authorities may also propose other forms of gps receiver performance standards which may limit design alternatives hamper product innovation or impose additional costs some of our products that use integrated radio communication technology require product type certification and some products require an enduser to obtain licensing from the fcc for frequencyband usage these are secondary licenses that are subject to certain restrictions an inability or delay in obtaining such certifications or changes to the rules by the fcc could adversely affect our ability to bring our products to market which could harm our customer relationships and therefore our operating results any failure to obtain the requisite certifications could also harm our operating results 

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes 

we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes can be difficult to predict management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability or may suffer unforeseen liabilities which could then impact the results of a financial period a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable which if not expected could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us 

generally accepted accounting principles in the us are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board or fasb the sec and other bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles for example in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under us gaap this standard establishes a principle for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services the standard also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining and fulfilling customer contracts asu 201409 is effective for fiscal 2017 including interim periods within that reporting period early adoption is not permitted we are currently in the process of assessing the adoption methodology which allows the amendment to be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application we are also evaluating the impact of the adoption of asu no 201409 on our consolidated financial statements and have not determined whether the effect will be material adoption of this standard along with any other changes in accounting principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change any difficulties in the implementation of new or changed accounting standards could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations changes in applicable accounting standards could have a significant effect on our 

reported financial results if our estimates relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions or judgments that change or prove to be incorrect our operating results could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price 

our debt could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations 

on november 24 2014 we issued senior notes notes due december 1 2024 in an aggregate principal amount of 4000 million the notes accrue interest at a rate of 475 per annum payable semiannually in arrears on december 1 and june 1 of each year beginning on june 1 2015 when the notes mature we will have to expend significant resources to repay these notes or seek to refinance them if we decide to refinance the notes we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the notes at all both of which may adversely affect our financial condition 

on november 24 2014 we entered into a new fiveyear credit agreement with a group of lenders the 2014 credit facility the 2014 credit facility provides for an unsecured revolving loan facility of 10 billion and a letter of credit subfacility of up to 500 million subject to the terms of the 2014 credit facility the revolving loan facility may be increased and term loan facilities may be established in an amount of up to 5000 million upon entering into the 2014 credit facility we borrowed 3070 million under this revolving loan facility we also have two 75 million revolving credit facilities which are uncommitted and may be called by the lenders with very little notice the uncommitted facilities at the end of fiscal 2014 our total debt was comprised primarily of notes of 4000 million a revolving loan balance of 2770 million under the 2014 credit facility and a revolving credit line balance of 570 million under the uncommitted facilities our outstanding indebtedness could have important consequences such as 

 there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and we may not be able to repay the indebtedness that becomes due a default under our debt instruments may also significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control 

changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income in future periods 

as a global company we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities our effective tax rate is largely based on the geographic mix of earnings statutory rates intercompany transfer pricing and enacted tax laws a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates including 

 we are currently in various stages of multiple year examinations by federal state and foreign taxing authorities including a review of our 2010 and 2011 tax years by the us internal revenue service or irs we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision if the irs or the taxing authorities of any other jurisdiction were to successfully challenge a material tax position we could become subject to higher taxes and our earnings would be adversely affected 

our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war terrorism or civil unrest 

acts of war acts of terrorism or other circumstances of civil unrest especially any directed at the gnss signals or systems could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may invoke a redeployment of the satellites used in gnss or interruptions of the system civil unrest local conflict or other political instability may adversely impact regional economies cause work stoppages and limitations on foreign business transactions in 2014 political instability and conflict in ukraine led to reduced sales in the regions and restrictions on sales to parts of this region to the extent that such interruptions result in delays or cancellations of orders disruption of the manufacture or shipment of our products or reduced demand for our products it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to the secs new rules regarding the use and disclosure of conflict minerals which we expect will increase our operating and compliance costs and could potentially harm our reputation causing a decline in our stock price 

the sec adopted its final rule implementing section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act concerning conflict minerals during august 2012 the goal of the rule is to cut direct and indirect funding of groups engaged in armed conflict and human rights abuses we are committed to compliance with the secs conflict minerals rule and support its intended objective this new rule requires us to 1 determine whether conflict minerals tin tantalum tungsten gold or similar derivatives are used in our products and if so determine if the minerals originated from the democratic republic of congo drc or its immediately adjoining countries and 2 if so conduct due diligence regarding the source and chain of custody of these conflict minerals to determine whether the conflict minerals financed or benefitted armed groups the rule required us to submit forms and reports to the sec by may 31 2014 and annually thereafter that disclose our determinations and due diligence measures 

trimble does not directly purchase any conflicts minerals tracing these materials back to their country of origin is a complex task that may require us to among other things survey suppliers in our supply chain to understand what programs they have in place for tracing the source of minerals supplied to us or used in products supplied to us and to ensure that reasonable due diligence has been performed presently we have not determined how many or if any of our supply chain partners use conflict minerals in addition to the increased administrative expense required to comply with the new requirements that apply to us we may face a limited pool of suppliers who can provide us “conflictfree” components parts and manufactured products and we may not be able to obtain conflictfree products or supplies in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices for our operations and may be required to disclose that our products are not “conflict free” this could adversely affect the company’s reputation and may harm its relationships with business partners and customers and our stock price could suffer as a result

legal proceedings 

tableend on august 9 2013 harbinger capital partners llc and additional plaintiffs “harbinger plaintiffs” filed a lawsuit against deere  co garmin international inc the company and two other defendants in the us district court in manhattan in connection with the harbinger plaintiffs’ investment in lightsquared the harbinger plaintiffs alleged among other things fraud and negligent misrepresentation claiming that the defendants were aware of material facts that caused the federal communications commission to take adverse action against lightsquared and affirmatively misrepresented and failed to disclose those facts prior to the harbinger plaintiffs’ investment in lightsquared the harbinger plaintiffs sought 19 billion in damages from the defendants on november 1 2013 debtor lightsquared inc and two related parties “lightsquared plaintiffs” filed suit against the same defendants in the us bankruptcy court in manhattan the lightsquared plaintiffs asserted claims similar to those made by the harbinger plaintiffs as well as additional claims including breach of contract and tortious interference and alleged that lightsquared invested billions of dollars in reliance on the promises and representations of defendants on january 31 2014 the us district court granted defendants’ motion to withdraw the lightsquared action from the us bankruptcy court to the us district court on february 5 2015 the us district court dismissed all claims brought by the harbinger plaintiffs and the majority of those brought by the lightsquared plaintiffs including those for breach of contract promissory estoppel quantum merit and tortious interference but allowed the lightsquared plaintiffs claims of negligent representation and constructive fraud to proceed to discovery on february 11 2015 the harbinger plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the district court’s dismissal of their claims although an unfavorable outcome of these litigation matters may have a material adverse effect on our operating results liquidity or financial position we believe the claims in these lawsuits are without merit and intend to vigorously contest these lawsuits 

on september 2 2011 recreational data services inc filed an action against us alleging misrepresentation and breach of contract arising from an unsuccessful business venture of the plaintiff recreational data services inc we believed this suit lacked any basis in law or fact and attempted to have the case dismissed on legal grounds prior to trial these efforts were not successful and the case was tried in front of a jury in alaska beginning on september 9 2014 on september 26 2014 the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff and awarded the plaintiff damages of 513 million on january 29 2015 the court granted our motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict effectively vacating the jury’s verdict and ordering that plaintiff take nothing on its claims we have submitted a proposed judgment to reflect this order and expect that the court will sign and enter that judgment in light of this order and anticipated judgment we have reversed the expense and liability previously accrued as a current liability 

under general and administrative expense in our third quarter of fiscal 2014 following the jury verdict once judgment in our favor is entered the plaintiff has the right to appeal the judgment 

from time to time we are also involved in litigation arising out of the ordinary course of our business there are no other material legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business to which we or any of our subsidiaries is a party or of which any of our or our subsidiaries property is subject

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that reflect our plans estimates and beliefs our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and those listed under “risks factors” 

executive level overview

our growth strategy is centered on multiple elements 

 

trimble’s focus on these growth drivers has led to growth in revenue and profitability as well as an increasingly diversified business model software and services growth is driving increased recurring revenue leading to improved visibility in our business as our solutions have expanded our go to market model has also evolved with a balanced mix between direct distribution and oem customers and an increasing number of enterprise level customer relationships finally profitability has improved over time in large part through expansion of gross margins as software and services have grown both organically and through acquisitions 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements we consider the accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting policies these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer or is uncertain revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 

contracts andor customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement shipping documents and customer acceptance when applicable are used to verify delivery we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analyses as well as the customer’s payment history 

revenue for orders is not recognized until the product is shipped and title has transferred to the buyer we bear all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods up to that point our shipment terms for us orders and international orders fulfilled from our european distribution center typically provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the carrier named by the buyer at the named place or point if no precise point is indicated by the buyer delivery is deemed to occur when the carrier takes the goods into its charge from the place determined by us other shipment terms may provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the buyer shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 

revenue from sales to distributors and dealers is recognized upon shipment assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met distributors and dealers do not have a right of return 

revenue from purchased extended warranty and post contract support pcs agreements is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the warranty or support period revenue from our subscription services related to our hardware and applications is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription service period beginning on the date that service is made available to the customer assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been met 

we present revenue net of sales taxes and any similar assessments 

our software arrangements generally consist of a perpetual license fee and pcs we generally have established vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for our pcs contracts based on the renewal rate the remaining value of the software arrangement is allocated to the license fee using the residual method license revenue is primarily recognized when the software has been delivered and fair value has been established for all remaining undelivered elements in cases where vsoe of fair value for pcs is not established revenue is recognized ratably over the pcs period after all software deliverables have been made and the only the undelivered element is pcs 

for services performed on a fixedfee basis revenue is recognized using the proportional performance method with performance measured based on hours of work performed for contracts that involve significant customization and implementation or consulting services that are essential to the functionality of the software the license and services revenues are recognized using the percentageofcompletion method or if we are unable to reliably estimate the costs to complete the services we use the completedcontract method of accounting a contract is considered complete when all significant costs have been incurred or when acceptance from the customer has been received 

some of our subscription product offerings include hardware subscription services and extended warranty under these hosted arrangements the customer typically does not have the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without incurring a significant penalty and it is not feasible for the customer to run the software either on its own hardware or on a thirdparty’s hardware 

our multiple deliverable product offerings include hardware with embedded firmware extended warranty software pcs services and subscription services which are considered separate units of accounting for certain of our products software and nonsoftware components function together to deliver the tangible product’s essential functionality 

in evaluating the revenue recognition for our hardware or subscription agreements which contain multiple deliverables we determined that in certain instances we were not able to establish vsoe for some or all deliverables in an arrangement as we infrequently sold each element on a standalone basis did not price products within a narrow range or had a limited sales history when vsoe cannot be established we attempt to establish the selling price of each element based on relevant thirdparty evidence tpe tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately generally our gotomarket strategy differs from that of competitors and offerings may contain a significant level of proprietary technology customization or differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained furthermore we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products’ selling prices are on a standalone basis therefore we typically are not able to establish the selling price of an element based on tpe 

when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe we use our best estimate of selling price besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis besp is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a standalone basis or for new or highly customized offerings we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including but not limited to pricing practices market conditions competitive landscape internal costs geographies and gross margin the determination of besp is made through consultation with and formal approval by our management taking into consideration our gotomarket strategy 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

our accounts receivable balance net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns reserve was 3620 million  at the end of fiscal 2014 as compared with 3379 million at the end of fiscal 2013 the allowance for doubtful accounts was 78 million and 63 million at the end of fiscal 2014 and 2013 respectively we evaluate ongoing collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors such as age of the accounts receivable balances credit quality historical experience and current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us a specific allowance for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 

inventory valuation 

our inventories net balance was 2781 million  at the end of fiscal 2014  as compared with 2543 million at the end of fiscal 2013  our inventory allowances at the end of fiscal 2014  were 411 million as compared with 406 million at the end of fiscal 2013  our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market adjustments are also made to reduce the cost of inventory for estimated excess or obsolete balances factors influencing these adjustments include declines in demand technological changes product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred tax asset or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized 

relative to uncertain tax positions we only recognize the tax benefit if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement our practice is to recognize interest andor penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 

our valuation allowance is primarily attributable to foreign net operating losses and state research and development credit carryforwards management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize these deferred tax assets and accordingly a valuation allowance has been provided for such amounts valuation allowance adjustments associated with an acquisition after the measurement period are recorded through income tax expense 

business combinations 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree based on their fair values at the acquisition date the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill 

when determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to expected future cash flows which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins customer attrition rates future changes in technology and brand awareness loyalty and position and discount rates fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available 

goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination intangible assets acquired individually with a group of other assets or in a business combination are recorded at fair value identifiable intangible assets are comprised of distribution channels and distribution rights patents licenses technology acquired backlog trademarks and inprocess research and development the fair value of intangible assets acquired is generally determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straightline method reflecting the pattern of economic benefits associated with these assets and have estimated useful lives ranging from one to twelve years with a weighted average useful life of 63 years goodwill is not subject to amortization but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment applying a fairvalue based test 

impairment of goodwill intangible assets and other longlived assets 

we evaluate goodwill at a minimum on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year based on the values on the first day of that quarter goodwill was reviewed for impairment utilizing a quantitative twostep process in the first step of this test goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit’s carrying amount including goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a discounted cash flow approach if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in step two the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill the difference is recognized as an impairment loss when we perform a quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment the determination of fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions the discounted cash flows are based upon among other things assumptions about expected future operating performance using riskadjusted discount rates actual future results may differ from those estimates as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 for each reporting unit our estimated fair values exceeded the carrying value by substantial margins on a percentage basis for certain earlier stage reporting units due to the smaller magnitude of the carrying value and fair value of each respective reporting unit the margins by which the fair value exceeded the carrying value on an absolute dollar basis were relatively small 

depreciation and amortization of the intangible assets and other longlived assets is provided using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives reflecting the pattern of economic benefits associated with these assets changes in circumstances such as technological advances changes to our business model or changes in the capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives of intangible assets or other longlived assets differing from initial estimates in cases where we determine that the useful life of an asset should be revised the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value will be depreciated over its revised remaining useful life these assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable based on their future cash flows the estimated future cash flows are based upon among other things assumptions about expected future operating performance and these estimates may differ from actual future cash flows the assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities if the sum of the projected undiscounted 

cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value 

warranty costs 

the liability for product warranties was 206 million at the end of fiscal 2014  as compared with 178 million at the end of fiscal 2013  we accrue for warranty costs as part of cost of sales based on associated material product costs technical support labor costs and costs incurred by third parties performing work on our behalf our expected future cost is primarily estimated based upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment when products sold include warranty provisions they are covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to 55 years 

while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates revisions to the estimated warranty accrual and related costs may be required 

stockbased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to our employees and directors based on estimated fair values the grant date fair value for options is estimated using a binomial valuation model the fair value of rights to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plan is estimated using the blackscholes optionpricing model the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 

the determination of fair value of sharebased payment awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors riskfree interest rates and any expected dividends in addition the binomial model incorporates actual optionpricing behavior and changes in volatility over the option’s contractual term 

we base the expected stock price volatility for stock purchase rights on implied volatilities of traded options on our stock and our expected stock price volatility for stock options is based on a combination of our historical stock price volatility for the period commensurate with the expected life of the stock option and the implied volatility of traded options the use of implied volatilities is based upon the availability of actively traded options on our stock with terms similar to our awards and also upon our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility however because the expected life of our stock options is greater than the terms of our traded options we use a combination of our historical stock price volatility commensurate with the expected life of our stock options and implied volatility of traded options 

we estimate the expected life of the awards based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and postvesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the options and purchase rights the riskfree interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the expected term of the awards 

we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future accordingly our expected dividend yield is zero 

stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income for fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures the stockbased compensation guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 

if factors change and we employ different assumptions to determine the fair value of our sharebased payment awards granted in future periods the compensation expense that we record under it may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period in addition valuation models including the blackscholes and binomial models may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stockbased compensation consequently there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stockbased compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise expiration early termination or forfeiture of those stockbased payments in the future certain stockbased payments such as employee stock options may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements alternatively values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 

results of operations 

overview 

the following table is a summary of revenue gross margin and operating income for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

  



basis of presentation 

we have a 5253 week fiscal year ending on the friday nearest to december 31 which for fiscal 2014 was january 2 2015 fiscal 2014 and 2012 were both 52week years fiscal 2013 was a 53week year 

revenue 

in fiscal 2014  total revenue increased by 1074 million  or 5  to 240 billion  from 229 billion  in fiscal 2013  of this increase product revenue increased 636 million  or 4  service revenue increased 318 million  or 9  and subscription revenue increased 120 million  or 4  the product and service increase in fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  was driven primarily by growth across engineering and construction and mobile solutions which included organic growth and to a lesser extent the impact of acquisitions product revenue growth was partially offset by a significant decrease in field solutions revenue primarily due to softness in agriculture subscription growth was driven by growth in mobile solutions partially offset by our change in accounting for virtual site solutions our joint venture with caterpillar which is now treated as an equity method investment in the prior year as a majority owner we consolidated virtual site solutions results and virtual site solutions revenue was included in engineering and construction subscription revenue we consider organic growth to include all revenue except for revenue associated with acquisitions made within the last four quarters 

on a segment basis the increase in fiscal 2014  was primarily due to engineering and construction and mobile solutions and to a lesser extent advanced devices engineering and construction revenue increased 1261 million  or 10  mobile solutions increased 217 million  or 5  and advanced devices increased 115 million  or 9  partially offset by a decrease in field solutions of 518 million  or 11  as compared to fiscal 2013  revenue growth within engineering and construction was driven primarily by organic growth due to building construction heavy civil and to a lesser extent survey products in the us and europe with the exception of russia which was significantly down to a lesser extent acquisitions contributed to the growth mobile solutions revenue increased primarily due to organic growth in the transportation and logistics market advanced devices revenue increased due to stronger sales of embedded and timing components field solutions revenue decreased significantly primarily due to softness in agricultural markets overall although foreign currency had a negative impact on revenue in the fourth quarter the impact on a full year basis was minor consistent with the fourth quarter we expect foreign currency will continue to have a negative impact in 2015 particularly in engineering and construction 

in fiscal 2013  total revenue increased by 2480 million  or 12  to 229 billion  from 204 billion  in fiscal 2012  of this increase product revenue increased 830 million  or 5  service revenue increased 1014 million  or 39  and subscription revenue increased 636 million  or 30  the product and service revenue increase in fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  was driven primarily by growth across engineering and construction and mobile solutions which included organic growth as well as the impact of the tmw acquisition the product revenue growth was slightly offset by a decrease in fields solutions revenue primarily due to softness in gis markets 

on a segment basis the increase in fiscal 2013  was primarily due to stronger results from the engineering and construction field solutions and mobile solutions segments engineering and construction revenue increased 1326 million or 12 mobile solutions increased 1170 million or 34 and advanced devices increased 65 million or 5 partially offset by a decrease 

in field solutions of 81 million or 2 as compared to fiscal 2012 revenue growth within engineering and construction was driven primarily by organic growth due to global sales of building construction and to a lesser extent heavy civil and survey products in the us and europe mobile solutions revenue increased primarily due to organic growth in the transportation and logistics market as well as acquisitions including tmw which was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 advanced devices revenue increased primarily due to stronger sales of rfid product solutions field solutions revenue decreased slightly due to softness in gis markets associated with economic uncertainties in the us which was partially offset by increased agricultural sales 

during fiscal 2014  sales to customers in the united states represented 48 europe represented 24 asia pacific represented 14 and other regions represented 14 of our total revenue during fiscal 2013 sales to customers in the united states represented 49 europe represented 23 asia pacific represented 14 and other regions represented 14 of our total revenue during fiscal 2012 sales to customers in the united states represented 47 europe represented 22 asia pacific represented 16 and other regions represented 15 of our total revenue we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue 

no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenue in fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  

gross margin 

our gross margin varies due to a number of factors including product mix pricing distribution channel production volumes new product startup costs and foreign currency translations 

in fiscal 2014  our gross margin increased by 870 million  as compared to fiscal 2013  primarily due to the increase in total revenue gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 539  in fiscal 2014  and 526  in fiscal 2013  the increase in the gross margin percentage was due to improved product mix in engineering and construction and mobile solutions particularly software software maintenance and subscription revenue this was partially offset by higher amortization of purchased intangibles and lower gross margin in field solutions due to manufacturing underutilization 

in fiscal 2013  our gross margin increased by 1576 million as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to the increase in total revenue gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 526 in fiscal 2013 and 513 in fiscal 2012 the increase in the gross margin percentage was due to improved product mix in engineering and construction and mobile solutions particularly software software maintenance and subscription revenue as well as the tmw acquisition which was partially offset by higher amortization of purchased intangibles 

operating income 

operating income decreased by  91 million  for fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  operating income as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2014  was 109  as compared to 110  for fiscal 2013  the decrease in operating income and operating income percentage was primarily due to the revenue decrease in field solutions and the impact of acquisitions in engineering and construction in the fourth quarter of the year the decrease was partially offset by gross margin improvements due to higher margin software maintenance and subscription revenue 

operating income increased by 392 million for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 operating income as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2013 was 110 as compared to 104 for fiscal 2012 the increase in operating income and operating income percentage was primarily driven by higher revenue and product mix due to higher margin software service and subscription revenue the increase was partially offset by higher amortization of purchased intangibles due to acquisitions 

results by segment 

to achieve distribution marketing production and technology advantages in our targeted markets we manage our operations in the following four segments engineering and construction field solutions mobile solutions and advanced devices segment operating income equals net revenue less cost of sales and operating expense excluding general corporate expense amortization of purchased intangible assets amortization of inventory stepup acquisition costs and restructuring charges 

the following table is a breakdown of revenue and operating income by segment for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

  



a reconciliation of our consolidated segment operating income to consolidated income before income taxes follows 

  



unallocated corporate expense includes general corporate expense amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup restructuring costs and litigation reserves 

engineering and construction 

engineering and construction revenue increased by 1261 million  or 10  while segment operating income increased by 176 million  or 7  for fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  the revenue growth was primarily driven by organic growth in the global sales of building construction and heavy civil and to a lesser extent survey products in markets that were relatively stable the impact of acquisition revenue on the full year was relatively minor sales were relatively strong in the us particularly for building construction products and heavy civil products which continued to grow however european markets demonstrated some slowness in growth growth was driven by increased adoption of our products particularly in the construction industry as technology is playing a broader role in increasing productivity and reducing costs survey sales were relatively strong during the year but slowed in the fourth quarter as oil and gas and the macroeconomic conditions in russia impacted survey sales to the extent that these trends continue our results of operations will be further impacted additionally although foreign currency had a minor impact on the full year we expect foreign currency will have a negative impact in 2015 

segment operating income increased primarily due to higher revenue and a more favorable product mix including higher margin software service and subscription revenue this was partially offset by the impact of increased operating expenses due in part to the impact of acquisitions although acquisitions contributed to revenue they also presented a short term negative impact on revenue and operating income partly because of deferred revenue accounting effects we expect these revenue recognition effects to impact the first half of 2015 as well 

engineering and construction revenue increased by 1326 million or 12 while segment operating income increased by 441 million or 21 for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 the revenue growth was primarily driven by organic growth in the global sales of building construction and to a lesser extent heavy highway and survey products in markets that were relatively stable sales were strong in the us particularly for building construction products as the residential and commercial construction markets continued to strengthen to a lesser extent europe was also up heavy civil which continued to grow was challenged by the combined effects of the australian recession the lack of european investment and limits on us highway funding survey instruments growth was stable segment operating income increased primarily due to higher revenue and product mix including higher margin software service and subscription revenue 

field solutions 

field solutions revenue decreased by 518 million  or 11  while segment operating income decreased by 389 million  or 22  for fiscal year 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  the revenue decrease was primarily due to softness in agriculture markets where the market environment grew significantly more difficult in the last half of the year 

on a macroeconomic level commodity prices and farmer income are both down large cutbacks coming from elements of our distribution and oem customers contributed to the sales slowdown in north america and to a lesser extent south america and europe we believe that the softness in agriculture will continue and our results of operations will be impacted in 2015 the agriculture decrease was partially offset by a slight increase in geographic information system gis sales segment operating income decreased primarily due to reduced operating leverage in agriculture 

field solutions revenue decreased by 81 million or 2 while segment operating income decreased by 90 million or 5 for fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 the revenue decrease was primarily due to a decline in gis markets which continued to be impacted by the pullback of government funding sources particularly in the us agriculture was moderately up over the prior year weather conditions in the first half of the year particularly in the us resulted in slower than anticipated agriculture sales however sales increased in the second half of the year with relatively strong growth in europe segment operating income decreased due to reduced operating leverage in gis 

mobile solutions 

mobile solutions revenue increased by 217 million  or 5  while segment operating income increased by 89 million  or 14  for fiscal year 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  the revenue increase was primarily due to continued organic growth in the transportation and logistics market which focuses on enterprise solutions this was partially offset by a decline in field services as the focus shifts to more vertical markets the majority of the sales are in the us however there is continued focus on geographic expansion which contributed to growth for the year operating income increased due to increased revenue and product mix including higher software maintenance and subscription revenue as well as product cost reductions 

mobile solutions revenue increased by 1170 million or 34 while segment operating income increased by 315 million or 97 for fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 the revenue increase was primarily due to organic growth in the transportation and logistics market as well as acquisitions not applicable in the prior periods including tmw which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2012 operating income increased due primarily to increased revenue and a more favorable product mix including higher software maintenance and subscription revenue 

advanced devices 

advanced devices revenue increased by 115 million  or 9  and segment operating income increased by 157 million  or 59  for fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  the increase in revenue and operating income was primarily driven by increased sales of timing and embedded component products as well as strong operating control 

advanced devices revenue increased by 65 million or 5 and segment operating income increased by 74 million or 39 for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 the increase in revenue and operating income was primarily driven by increased sales of timing inertialgnss positioning and orientation systems and military specific products 

research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 

the following table shows research and development “rd” sales and marketing and general and administrative “ga” expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions of those operating expenses below

nonoperating income net 

the following table shows nonoperating income net for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

  

total nonoperating income net increased by 41 million  during fiscal 2014  compared with fiscal 2013  the increase was primarily due to a gain on a partial equity sale of virtual site solutions included in other income loss net partially offset by lower profitability from joint ventures and the impact of foreign currency transaction fluctuations 

total nonoperating income net decreased by 157 million during fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 the decrease was primarily due to an increase in interest expense due to higher average debt balances outstanding the impact of lower income from equity method investments namely joint ventures and gains on the sale of several investments included in other income net in the prior year partially offset by the impact of foreign currency transaction fluctuations 

income tax provision 

our effective income tax rates for fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  were 20 14 and 17 respectively the fiscal 2014 rate was less than the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the geographical mix of our pretax income and to a lesser extent the inclusion of the current year us federal rd credit partially offset by the effect of a gain on a partial equity sale of vss the fiscal 2013 rate was less than the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the geographical mix of our pretax income and to a lesser extent the inclusion of the current year us federal rd credit the favorable benefit of the retroactive reinstatement of the 2012 rd credit and the benefit of the tax rate reduction in finland the fiscal 2012 rate was less than the federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the geographical mix of our pretax income 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than operating lease inventory purchase and other commitments incurred in the normal course of business see contractual obligations table below we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities guarantee contracts retained or contingent interests in transferred assets or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity we do not have any majorityowned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements additionally we do not have any interest in or relationship with any special purpose entities 

in the normal course of business to facilitate sales of its products we indemnify other parties including customers lessors and parties to other transactions with us with respect to certain matters we have agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties these agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents 

it is not possible to determine the maximum potential exposure under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under these agreements have not been material and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on the consolidated balance sheets at the end of fiscal 2014 and 2013 

liquidity and capital resources 

  



cash and cash equivalents 

at the end of fiscal 2014  cash and cash equivalents totaled 1480 million  compared to 1472 million  at the end of fiscal 2013  we had debt of 7384 million  at the end of fiscal 2014  compared to 7585 million  at the end of fiscal 2013  

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents together with borrowings under our 2014 credit facility as described below under the heading “debt” will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs debt service planned capital expenditures and stock purchases under the stock repurchase program for at least the next twelve months 

we anticipate that planned capital expenditures primarily for continued upgrade of our erp systems as well as computer equipment software manufacturing tools and test equipment and leasehold improvements associated with business expansion will constitute a partial use of our cash resources decisions related to how much cash is used for investing are influenced by the expected amount of cash to be provided by operations 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 4071 million  for fiscal 2014  as compared to 4146 million  for fiscal 2013  the decrease of 76 million  was due to an increase in inventory and to a lesser extent a decrease in net income before noncash depreciation and amortization primarily due to decreased operating income in field solutions this was partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue 

cash provided by operating activities was 4146 million for fiscal 2013 as compared to 3407 million for fiscal 2012 the increase of 739 million was due to an increase in net income before noncash depreciation and amortization primarily attributable to engineering and construction and mobile solutions segments’ increased operating income and to a lesser extent an increase 

in deferred revenue and a decrease in accounts receivable attributable to lower dso this was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable due to the timing of payments 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 3440 million  for fiscal 2014  as compared to 3248 million  for fiscal 2013  the increase is primarily due to cash used for business and intangible asset acquisitions fiscal 2014 acquisitions included manhattan software amtech and other acquisitions fiscal 2013 acquisitions included alk trade services and other acquisitions 

cash used in investing activities was 3248 million for fiscal 2013 as compared to 7643 million for fiscal 2012 primarily due to cash used for business and intangible asset acquisitions fiscal 2013 acquisitions included alk trade services and other acquisitions fiscal 2012 acquisitions included tmw sketchup and other acquisitions 

financing activities 

cash used by financing activities was 515 million  for fiscal 2014  as compared to cash used of 984 million  during fiscal 2013  the decrease of 469 million  was primarily due to a decrease in debt proceeds net of repayments slightly offset by an increase in proceeds received from the issuance of common stock related to stock option exercises and stock repurchase 

cash used by financing activities was 984 million for fiscal 2013 as compared to cash provided of 4264 million during fiscal 2012 the decrease of 5248 million was primarily due to a decrease in debt proceeds net of repayments slightly offset by an increase in proceeds received from the issuance of common stock related to stock option exercises 

accounts receivable and inventory metrics 

  

accounts receivable days sales outstanding were up at 58 days at the end of fiscal 2014  as compared to 55 days at the end of fiscal 2013  primarily due to the impact of acquisitions during the year our accounts receivable days sales outstanding are calculated based on ending accounts receivable net divided by revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter times a quarterly average of 91 days due to fiscal 2013 being a 53week year our accounts receivable days sales outstanding for fiscal 2013 is calculated based on ending accounts receivable net divided by revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter times 98 days for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 our inventory turns were 39 at the end of fiscal 2014 as compared to 41 at the end of fiscal 2013 our inventory turnover is based on the total cost of sales for the fiscal period over the average inventory for the corresponding fiscal period 

debt 

notes 

on october 30 2014 we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission “sec” for the issuance of senior debt securities on november 24 2014 we issued 4000 million of senior notes “notes” under the shelf registration statement the notes mature on december 1 2024 and accrue interest at a rate of 475 per annum payable semiannually in arrears on december 1 and june 1 of each year beginning on june 1 2015 the notes are classified as longterm in the consolidated balance sheet 

prior to september 1 2024 we may redeem the notes at our option at any time in whole or in part at a redemption price equal to the greater of i 100  of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed and ii the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of interest and principal calculated on a semiannual basis using a discount rate equal to the us treasury rate plus 40 basis points after september 1 2024 we may redeem the notes at our option at any time in whole or in part at a redemption price equal to 100  of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon in addition in the event of a change of control as defined in the prospectus filed with the sec each holder of the notes will have the right to require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of such holder’s notes at a purchase price equal to 101  of the principal amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest 

in connection with the closing of the notes offering we entered into an indenture with us bank national association as trustee the indenture contains covenants limiting our ability to create certain liens enter into sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate or merge with or into or convey transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to another person each subject to certain exceptions the notes contain no financial covenants we were in compliance with these covenants at the end of fiscal 2014 

2014 credit facility 

on november 24 2014 we entered into a new fiveyear credit agreement with a group of lenders the “2014 credit facility” which replaced our previous 2012 credit facility the 2014 credit facility provides for an unsecured revolving loan facility of 10 billion and a letter of credit subfacility of up to 500 million subject to the terms of the 2014 credit facility the revolving loan facility may be increased andor term loan facilities may be established in an amount up to 5000 million the outsanding balance of 2770 million is classified as longterm in the consolidated balance sheet 

the funds available under the 2014 credit facility may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes the financing of certain acquisitions and the payment of transaction fees and expenses related to such acquisitions under the 2014 credit facility we may borrow repay and reborrow funds under the revolving loan facility until its maturity on november 24 2019 at which time the revolving facility will terminate and all outstanding loans together with all accrued and unpaid interest must be repaid amounts not borrowed under the 10 billion revolving facility will be subject to a commitment fee to be paid in arrears on the last day of each fiscal quarter ranging from 010 to 030 per annum depending on either our credit rating at such time or our leverage ratio as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter whichever results in more favorable pricing to us 

we may borrow funds under the 2014 credit facility in us dollars euros or in certain other agreed currencies and borrowings will bear interest at our option at either i a floating per annum base rate determined by reference to the highest of a the administrative agent’s prime rate b 050 per annum above the federal funds effective rate and c reserveadjusted libor for an interest period of one month plus 100 plus a margin of between 000 and 075 or ii a reserveadjusted fixed per annum rate based on libor or euribor depending on the currency borrowed plus a margin of between 100 and 175 the applicable margin in each case is determined based on either trimble’s credit rating at such time or trimble’s leverage ratio as of its most recently ended fiscal quarter whichever results in more favorable pricing to us interest is payable on the last day of each fiscal quarter with respect to borrowings bearing interest at the base rate or on the last day of an interest period but at least every three months with respect to borrowings bearing interest at libor or euribor rate 

the 2014 credit facility contains various customary representations and warranties by us which include customary use of materiality material adverse effect and knowledge qualifiers the 2014 credit facility also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including among other requirements negative covenants that restrict our ability to create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions and that restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to incur indebtedness further the 2014 credit facility contains financial covenants that require the maintenance of minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios specifically we must maintain as of the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of a ebitda as defined in the 2014 credit facility to b interest expense for the most recently ended period of four fiscal quarters of not less than 350 to 100 we must also maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of x total indebtedness as defined in the 2014 credit facility to y ebitda as defined in the 2014 credit facility for the most recently ended period of four fiscal quarters of not greater than 300 to 100 provided that on the completion of a material acquisition we may increase the ratio by 050 for the fiscal quarter during which such acquisition occurred and each of the three subsequent fiscal quarters we were in compliance with these covenants at the end of fiscal 2014 

the 2014 credit facility contains events of default that include among others nonpayment of principal interest or fees breach of covenants inaccuracy of representations and warranties cross defaults to certain other indebtedness bankruptcy and insolvency events material judgments and events constituting a change of control upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default interest on the obligations will accrue at an increased rate in the case of an event of default arising from the nonpayment of principal and the lenders may accelerate our obligations under the 2014 credit facility except that acceleration will be automatic in the case of bankruptcy and insolvency events of default 

the interest rate on the noncurrent debt outstanding under the credit facilities was 142 and 167 at the end of fiscal 2014 and 2013 respectively 

uncommitted facilities 

we also have two 75 million revolving credit facilities which are uncommitted the “uncommitted facilities” the uncommitted facilities may be called by the lenders at any time have no covenants and no specified expiration date the interest rate on the uncommitted facilities is 100  plus either libor or the bank’s cost of funds or as otherwise agreed upon by the bank and us the 570 million  outstanding at the end of 2014 and the 850 million  outstanding at the end of 2013 under the uncommitted facilities are classified as shortterm in our consolidated balance sheet the weighted average interest rate on the uncommitted facilities was 115  at the end of fiscal 2014 and 131  at the end of fiscal 2013 

for additional discussion of our debt see note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

repatriation of foreign earnings and income taxes 

at the end of fiscal 2014 1283 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries if these funds are needed for our operations in the us we would not be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds due to intercompany financing arrangements with our foreign subsidiaries while a significant portion of our foreign earnings continue to be permanently reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries it is anticipated this reinvestment will not impede cash needs at the parent company level in our determination of which foreign earnings are permanently reinvested we consider numerous factors including the financial requirements of the us parent company the financial requirements of the foreign subsidiaries and the tax consequences of remitting the foreign earnings back to the us there are no other material impediments to our ability to access sources of liquidity and our resulting ability to meet short and longterm liquidity needs other than in the event we are not in compliance with the covenants under our 2014 credit facility and notes or the potential tax costs of remitting foreign earnings back to the us 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at the end of fiscal 2014 

  



  

 at the end of fiscal 2014 we had unrecognized tax benefits included in other noncurrent liabilities of 436 million  including interest and penalties at this time we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with tax authorities regarding this liability and therefore such amounts are not included in the contractual obligations table above 

effect of new accounting pronouncements 

the impact of recent accounting pronouncements is disclosed in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

reconciliation of gaap to nongaap financial measures 

our nongaap measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap measures the nongaap financial measures included in the following tables as well as detailed explanations to the adjustments to comparable gaap measures are set forth below 

nongaap gross margin 

we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap gross margin as a way of understanding how product mix pricing decisions and manufacturing costs influence our business nongaap gross margin excludes restructuring costs amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation and amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup from gaap gross margin we believe that these exclusions offer investors additional information that may be useful to view trends in our gross margin performance 

nongaap operating expenses 

we believe this measure is important to investors evaluating our nongaap spending in relation to revenue nongaap operating expenses exclude restructuring costs amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation acquisitiondivestiture costs associated with external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition activities such as legal due diligence and integration costs from gaap operating expenses and litigation expenses we believe that these exclusions offer investors supplemental information to facilitate comparison of our operating expenses to our prior results 

nongaap operating income 

we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap operating income trends which are driven by revenue gross margin and spending nongaap operating income excludes restructuring costs amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisitiondivestiture costs associated with external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition activities such as legal due diligence integration costs and acquisition bonus payments and litigation expenses we believe that these exclusions offer an alternative means for our investors to evaluate current operating performance compared to results of other periods 

nongaap nonoperating income net 

we believe this measure helps investors evaluate our nonoperating income trends nongaap nonoperating income net excludes acquisition and divestiture gainslosses associated with unusual acquisition related items such as adjustments to the fair value of earnout liabilities intangible asset impairment charges and gains or losses related to the acquisition or sale of certain businesses and investments and a gain on an equity sale these gainslosses are specific to particular acquisitions and divestitures and vary significantly in amount and timing nongaap nonoperating income net also excludes the writeoff of debt issuance costs as well as a foreign exchange loss associated with hedges for one of our acquisitions we believe that these exclusions provide investors with a supplemental view of our ongoing financial results 

nongaap income tax provision 

nongaap items tax effected adjusts the provision for income taxes to reflect the effect of certain nongaap items on nongaap net income we believe this information is useful to investors because it provides for consistent treatment of the excluded items in our nongaap presentation 

nongaap net income 

this measure provides a supplemental view of net income trends which are driven by nongaap income before taxes and our nongaap tax rate nongaap net income excludes restructuring costs amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisition and divestiture costs a gain on an equity sale a write off of debt issuance costs a foreign exchange loss from hedges associated with one of our acquisitions litigation and nongaap tax adjustments from gaap net income we believe our investors benefit from understanding these exclusions and from an alternative view of our net income performance as compared to our past net income performance 

nongaap diluted net income per share 

we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap operating performance as reflected in a per share calculation as a way of measuring nongaap operating performance by ownership in the company nongaap diluted net income per share excludes restructuring costs amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisition and divestiture costs a gain on an equity sale a write off of debt issuance costs a foreign exchange loss from hedges associated with one of our acquisitions litigation and nongaap tax adjustments from gaap diluted net income per share we believe that these exclusions offer investors a useful view of our diluted net income per share as compared to our past diluted net income per share 

nongaap operating leverage 

we believe this information is beneficial to investors as a measure of how much incremental revenue contributed to our operating income nongaap operating leverage is the increase in nongaap operating income as a percentage of the increase in revenue we believe that this information offers investors supplemental information to evaluate our current performance and to compare to our past nongaap operating leverage 

nongaap segment operating income 

nongaap segment operating income excludes stockbased compensation from gaap segment operating income we believe this information is useful to investors because some may exclude stockbased compensation as an alternative view when assessing trends in the operating income of our segments 

these nongaap measures can be used to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance as well as our performance relative to competitors we believe some of our investors track our core operating performance as a means of evaluating our performance in the ordinary ongoing and customary course of our operations core operating performance excludes items that are noncash not expected to recur or not reflective of ongoing financial results management also believes that looking at our core operating performance provides a supplemental way to provide consistency in period to period comparisons accordingly management excludes from nongaap those items relating to restructuring amortization of purchased intangible assets stock based compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisition and divestiture costs a gain on an equity sale a write off of debt issuance costs a foreign exchange loss from hedges associated with one of our acquisitions litigation and nongaap tax adjustments for detailed explanations of the adjustments made to comparable gaap measures see items a   m below 







 48 

assets over may be substantially different from the time period that an internal growth company incurs and recognizes such expenses we believe that by excluding the amortization of purchased intangible assets which primarily represents technology andor customer relationships already developed it provides an alternative way for investors to compare our operations preacquisition to those postacquisitions and to those of our competitors that have pursued internal growth strategies however we note that companies that grow internally will incur costs to develop intangible assets that will be expensed in the period incurred which may make a direct comparison more difficult 

 

 49 

this item from our nongaap income tax provision because it facilitates a comparison of the nongaap tax rate in the current period to the nongaap tax rates in prior periods 

 

nongaap operating income 

nongaap operating income increased by 59 million  for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 and increased by 765 million  for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 nongaap operating income as a percentage of total revenue was 200  207 and 195 for fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

the increase in operating income for 2014 was primarily due to a revenue increase in engineering and construction and mobile solutions partially offset by revenue decrease in field solutions and the impact of acquisitions in engineering and construction the decrease of operating income percentage for 2014 was primarily due to a revenue decrease in field solutions and the impact of acquisitions in engineering and construction the decrease was partially offset by gross margin improvements due to higher margin software maintenance and subscription revenue the increase in operating income and operating income percentage for 2013 was primarily driven by higher revenue and product mix due to higher margin software service and subscription revenue in engineering and construction and mobile solutions

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors 

market interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds treasury bills interest and noninterest bearing bank deposits as well as bank time deposits the main objective of these instruments is safety of principal and liquidity while maximizing return without significantly increasing risk 

due to the shortterm nature of our cash equivalents we do not anticipate any material effect on our portfolio due to fluctuations in interest rates 

we are exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing interest rates under our credit facilities our 2014 credit facility is comprised of a revolving credit agreement and a letter of credit subfacility with maturity dates of november 24 2019 and also two unsecured uncommitted revolving credit agreements that are callable by the bank at any time we may borrow funds under these facilities in us dollars or in certain other currencies and borrowings will bear interest as described under note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 at the end of fiscal 2014 we had outstanding a revolving loan of 2770 million under the 2014 credit facility and a revolving credit line of 570 million under the uncommitted facilities a hypothetical 10 increase in our borrowing rates at the end of fiscal 2014 could result in approximately 01 million annual increase in interest expense on the existing principal balances of the revolving loan 

the hypothetical changes and assumptions made above will be different from what actually occurs in the future furthermore the computations do not anticipate actions that may be taken by our management should the hypothetical market changes actually occur over time as a result actual earnings effects in the future will differ from those quantified above 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we operate in international markets which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and various foreign currencies the most significant of which is the euro 

historically the majority of our revenue contracts are denominated in us dollars with the most significant exception being europe where we invoice primarily in euros additionally a portion of our expenses primarily the cost to manufacture cost of personnel to deliver technical support on our products and professional services sales and sales support and research and development are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the euro swedish krona new zealand dollar british pound and canadian dollar 

revenue resulting from selling in local currencies and costs incurred in local currencies are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which can affect our operating income as exchange rates vary operating income may differ from expectations in fiscal 2014 revenue was negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange rates by 47 million the impact to operating income was immaterial 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash and certain trade and intercompany receivables and payables primarily denominated in australian canadian singapore and new zealand dollars japanese yen chinese yuan indian rupee brazilian real south african rand swedish krona swiss franc euro and british pound these contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rate movements as the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses on the forward contracts these instruments are marked to market through earnings every period and generally range from one to three months in original maturity we do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes we occasionally enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase price of some of our larger business acquisitions foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at the end of fiscal 2014 and 2013 are summarized as follows in thousands

seasonality of business 

 our individual segment revenue may be affected by seasonal buying patterns historically the second fiscal quarter has been the strongest quarter for the company driven by the construction buying season 

backlog 

in most of our markets the time between order placement and shipment is short orders are generally placed by customers on an asneeded basis in general customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty for these reasons we do not believe that backlog is a meaningful indicator of future revenue or material to understanding our business

risk factors 

tableend risks and uncertainties 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k and in any other documents to which we refer you in this form 10k before purchasing our securities the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 

our operating results in each quarter may be affected by special conditions such as seasonality late quarter purchases weather economic conditions timing of revenue recognition and other potential issues 

due in part to the buying patterns of our customers a significant portion of our quarterly revenue occurs from orders received and immediately shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of each quarter although our operating expense tends to remain fairly predictable engineering and construction purchases tend to occur in early spring and governmental agencies tend to utilize funds available at the end of the government’s fiscal year for additional purchases at the end of our third fiscal quarter in september of each year concentrations of orders sometimes also occur at the end of our other two fiscal quarters additionally a majority of our sales force earns commissions on a quarterly basis which may cause concentrations of orders at the end of any fiscal quarter it could harm our operating results if for any reason expected sales are deferred orders are not received or shipments are delayed 

a few days at the end of a quarter over the last few years we have derived an increasing percentage of our revenue from software revenue recognition for such sales can be complicated and if we are not able to satisfy all of the elements for recognition associated with software sales this could impact the amount of revenue we report in any quarterly period additionally due to the complexities associated with revenue recognition we may not be able to accurately forecast our nondeferred and deferred revenues which could cause us to miss our earnings or revenue projections and consequently negatively impact our stock price 

in addition our operations and performance depend on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of business spending in the recent past uncertainties in the financial and credit markets have caused our customers to postpone purchases and negative economic conditions may reduce future sales of or demand for our products and services in addition negative economic conditions may depress the tax revenues of federal state and local government entities which are significant purchasers of our products with the exception primarily of our mobile solutions and advanced devices segments our products are generally sold through a dealer channel and our dealers depend on the availability of credit to finance purchases of our products for their inventory additionally any disruption in our supply chain could impact our ability to meet our quarterly revenue 

customer collections are our primary source of cash while we believe we have a strong customer base and have experienced strong collections in the past negative economic conditions may result in increased collection times or greater writeoffs which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow any writeoff of goodwill or intangible assets could also negatively impact our financial results these and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and operating results 

investing in and integrating new acquisitions could be costly and may place a significant strain on our management systems and resources which could negatively impact our operating results 

we typically acquire a number of companies each year and intend to continue to acquire other companies acquisitions of companies entail numerous risks including 

 as a result of such acquisitions we have significant assets that include goodwill and other purchased intangibles the testing of this goodwill and intangibles for impairment under established accounting guidelines requires significant use of judgment and assumptions changes in business conditions could require adjustments to the valuation of these assets in addition losses incurred by a company in which we have an investment may have a direct impact on our financial statements or could result in our having to writedown the value of such investment any such problems in integration or adjustments to the value of the assets acquired could harm our growth strategy and could be costly and place a significant strain on our management systems and resources companies that we acquire may operate with different cost and margin structures which could further cause fluctuations in our operating results and adversely affect our operating margins 

we face competition in our markets which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition 

our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price quality and performance of our products the level of customer service the development of new technology and our ability to participate in emerging markets within each of our markets we encounter direct competition from other gnss software optical and laser suppliers and competition may intensify from various larger us and nonus competitors and new market entrants particularly from emerging markets such as china and india in addition as we sell an increasing amount of software and subscription services we face competition from a group 

of large well established companies with whom we have not previously competed this may require us to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes that we have not previously been exposed to including those related to cloud computing mobile devices and new computing platforms the competition in the future may in some cases result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the future against existing and additional competitors will depend largely on our ability to execute our strategy to provide systems and products with significantly differentiated features compared to currently available products we may not be able to implement this strategy successfully and our products may not be competitive with other technologies or products that may be developed by our competitors many of whom have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing sales and other resources than we do 

we may not be able to enter into or maintain important alliances and distribution relationships 

we believe that in certain business opportunities our success will depend on our ability to form and maintain alliances with industry participants such as caterpillar nikon and cnh global our failure to form and maintain such alliances or the preemption of such alliances by actions of competitors will adversely affect our ability to sell our products to customers we also utilize dealer networks including those affiliated with some of our strategic allies such as caterpillar and cnh global to market sell and service some of our products our relationships with substantial partners such as caterpillar and cnh are complex and multifaceted and may be subject to change based upon the business needs and objectives of the parties since these strategic relationships account for significant ongoing business in certain of our important markets changes in these relationships could adversely affect our sales and revenues disruption of dealer coverage within a specific geographic market could cause difficulties in marketing selling or servicing our products and have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition moreover dealers who carry products that compete with our products may focus their inventory purchases and sales efforts on goods provided by competitors due to industry demand or profitability such inventory adjustments and sourcing decisions can adversely impact our sales financial condition and results of operations 

changes in our product mix including increasing provision of software and bundled solutions tailored to the needs of specific vertical markets impose new demands on our distribution channels and may require significant changes in the skills and expertise required to successfully distribute our products and services or the creation of new distribution channels recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in the use of our technology and product offerings requires significant time and resources in order to develop and expand our distribution channels we must continue to expand and improve our processes and procedures that support our channel including our investment in systems and training and those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and difficult to manage the time and expense required for sales and marketing organizations of our channel partners to become familiar with our product offerings including our new product developments may make it more difficult to introduce those products to endusers and delay enduser adoption of our product offerings which could result in lower revenues 

we are increasingly selling products and solutions directly to large enterprise customers a direct sales model requires different skills and management processes and procedures from those we have generally used in our business in the past and may create conflicts with our channel partners if we are not successful in executing a direct sales model or in managing conflict with our channel partners our sales and revenue may suffer 

our information systems or those of our outside vendors may be subject to disruption delays or security incidents that could adversely impact our customers and operations 

we rely on our information systems and those of third parties for things such as processing customer orders delivery of products providing services and support to our customers billing and tracking our customers hosting and managing customer data and otherwise running our business any disruption in our information systems and those of the third parties upon whom we rely could have a significant impact on our business 

a security incident in our own systems or the systems of our third party providers may compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of our own internal data the availability of our products and websites designed to support our customers or our customer data computer hackers foreign governments or cyber terrorists may attempt to penetrate our network security and our website unauthorized access to our proprietary business information or customer data may be obtained through breakins sabotage breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks employee theft or misuse breach of the security of the networks of our third party providers or other misconduct because the techniques used by computer programmers who may attempt to penetrate and sabotage our network security or our website change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques it is also possible that unauthorized access to customer data may be obtained through inadequate use of security controls by customers 

while our products and services provide and support strong password controls ip restriction and other security mechanisms the use of such mechanisms are controlled in many cases by our customers we may also experience delays or interruptions caused 

by a number of factors including access to the internet the failure of our network or software systems or significant variability in visitor traffic on our product websites it is also possible that hardware or software failures or errors in our systems or in those of our third party providers could result in data loss or corruption or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our customers regard as significant these failures and interruptions could harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers 

our systems also remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunication failures computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks human error and similar events or disruptions some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities our systems are also subject to intentional acts of vandalism despite any precautions we may take the occurrence of a natural disaster a decision by any of our thirdparty hosting providers to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could cause system interruptions and delays and result in loss of critical data and lengthy interruptions in our services 

an increasing portion of our revenue comes from software as a service solutions and other hosted services in which we host store retrieve and manage the communication of data which is critical to our customers’ business systems disruption of our systems which support these services and solutions could cause disruptions in our customers’ systems and in the businesses that rely on these systems any such disruptions could harm our reputation create liabilities to our customers hurt demand for our services and solutions and negatively impact our revenues and profitability 

many of our products rely on gnss technology gps and other satellite systems which may become degraded or inoperable and result in lost revenue 

gnss technology gps satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible intentional disruption many of the gps satellites currently in orbit were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of 31 satellites in place nearly one third have already been in operation for more than 15 years repair of damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites a reduction in the number of operating satellites below the 24satellite standard established for gps may impair the utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities gps satellites and ground control segments are being modernized gps modernization software updates can cause problems we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of gps updates 

as the principal gnss currently in operation we are dependent on continued operation of gps gps is operated by the u s government which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps however if the policy were to change and gps were no longer supported by the u s government or if user fees were imposed it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

many of our products also use signals from systems that augment gps such as the wide area augmentation system and national differential gps system and satellites transmitting signal corrections data on mobile satellite services frequencies utilized by our omnistar corrections services some of these augmentation systems are operated by the federal government and rely on continued funding and maintenance of these systems in addition some of our products also use satellite signals from the russian glonass system any curtailment of the operating capability of these systems or limitations on access to or use of the signals or discontinuance of service could result in decreased user capability thereby impacting our markets 

the european community is developing an independent radio navigation satellite system known as galileo although we have a commercial license to market and sell receivers capable of receiving the galileo open service signals european authorities in the future may decide to offer other premium or encrypted service signals under different licenses or provide preferential access to european companies including our competitors even though a fully operational galileo system is several years away if we are unable to develop timely and competitive commercial products using the system or obtain a timely license to future galileo service signals it could result in lost revenue which could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

we may be unable to replace lost revenue due to customer cancellations or renewals at lower rates 

an increasing portion of our revenue is generated through software maintenance and subscription revenue decreases in maintenance or subscription attach or renewal rates or a decrease in the number of new licenses or hardware sold with subscription services could negatively impact our future revenue and financial results 

our customers have no obligation to renew their agreements for our software maintenance or subscription services after the expiration of their initial contract period which range from one to five years our customers attach and renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the overall global economy the health of their businesses and customer 

dissatisfaction with our services if customers do not renew their contracts for our products our maintenance and subscription revenue will decline and our financial results will suffer 

a portion of the growth of our maintenance revenue has typically been associated with growth of the number of licenses that we sell any reduction in the number of licenses that we sell even if our customers attach rates do not change will have a negative impact on our future maintenance revenue growth in addition a portion of the growth of our subscription revenue has typically been associated with the growth in the number of hardware sales that we sell in conjunction with the subscription services any reduction in the number of hardware sales will have a negative impact on our future subscription service growth since its introduction our software as service delivery model has also contributed to subscription revenue if any of our assumptions about expenses revenue or revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect or our attempts to improve efficiency are not successful our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated and our financial results will be negatively impacted 

changes to our licensing or subscription renewal programs or bundling of our products could negatively impact the timing of our recognition of revenue 

we continually reevaluate our licensing programs and subscription renewal programs including specific license models delivery methods and terms and conditions to market our current and future products and services we could implement different licensing models in certain circumstances for which we would recognize licensing fees over a longer period over the last few years we have increasingly offered additional products in a software as a service model software as a service revenues are recognized ratably over the subscription period any significant increase in the percentage of our business generated from such a subscription model could increase the amount of revenue to be recognized over time as opposed to upfront which could delay revenue recognition and have a negative impact on our operating results in addition changes to our licensing programs and subscription renewal programs including the timing of the release of enhancements upgrades maintenance releases the term of the contract discounts promotions and other factors could impact the timing of the recognition of revenue for our products related enhancements and services and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income in future periods 

a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates including 

 we are currently in various stages of multiple year examinations by federal state and foreign taxing authorities including a review of our 2010 and 2011 tax years by the us internal revenue service or irs our effective tax rate is based on the geographic mix of earnings statutory rates intercompany transfer pricing and enacted tax laws if the irs or the taxing authorities of any other jurisdiction were to successfully challenge a material tax position we could become subject to higher taxes and our earnings would be adversely affected 

we are dependent on the availability and unimpaired use of allocated bands within the radio frequency spectrum 

our gnss technology is dependent on the use of satellite signals and on terrestrial communication bands international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union itu a specialized technical agency of the united nations these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used in the united states the federal communications commission fcc and the national telecommunications and information administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations 

any itu or local reallocation of radio frequency bands including frequency band segmentation and sharing of spectrum or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of 

our products and have significant negative impacts on our customers both of which could reduce demand for our products for example the fcc has been considering proposals to repurpose spectrum adjacent to the gps bands for terrestrial broadband wireless operations throughout the united states if the fcc were to permit implementation of such proposals or similar proposals terrestrial broadband wireless operations could create harmful interference to gps receivers within range of such operations and impose costs to retrofit or replace affected receivers 

many of our products use other radio frequency bands such as the public land mobile radio bands together with the gnss signal to provide enhanced gnss capabilities such as realtime kinematics precision the continuing availability of these nongnss radio frequencies is essential to provide enhanced gnss products to our precision survey agriculture and construction machine controls markets in addition emissions from other services and equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or inband may impair the utility and reliability of our products any regulatory changes in spectrum allocation or in allowable operating conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our debt could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations 

on november 21 2012 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with a group of lenders the “2012 credit facility” this credit facility provides for unsecured credit facilities in the aggregate principal amount of 14 billion comprised of a fiveyear revolving loan facility of 7000 million and a fiveyear 7000 million term loan facility subject to the terms of the 2012 credit facility the revolving loan facility may be increased andor additional term loan commitments may be established in an aggregate principal amount up to 3000 million additionally we have two 75 million uncommitted revolving loan facilities which are callable by the bank at any time and have no covenants at the end of fiscal 2013  our total debt was comprised primarily of a term loan of 6650 million  and a revolving credit line of 220 million under the 2012 credit facility and a revolving credit line of 630 million under the uncommitted facilities debt incurred under this agreement could have important consequences such as 

 additionally if we were to default under our amended credit agreement and were unable to obtain a waiver for such a default interest on the obligations would accrue at an increased rate and the lenders could accelerate our obligations under the amended credit agreement that acceleration will be automatic in the case of bankruptcy and insolvency events of default additionally our subsidiaries that have guaranteed the amended credit agreement could be required to pay the full amount of our obligations under the amended credit agreement any such enforcement action on the part of the lenders against us or our subsidiaries would harm our financial condition 

we are subject to the impact of governmental and other similar certifications processes and regulations which could adversely affect our products and our business 

we market certain products that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold for example ce certification for radiated emissions is required for most gnss receiver and data communications products sold in the european community in the future us governmental authorities may propose gps receiver testing and certification for compliance with published gps signal interface or other specifications an inability to obtain any such certifications in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our operating results governmental authorities may also propose other forms of gps receiver performance standards which may limit design alternatives hamper product innovation or impose additional costs some of our products that use integrated radio communication technology require product type certification and some products require an enduser to obtain licensing from the fcc for frequencyband usage these are secondary licenses that are subject to certain restrictions an inability or delay in obtaining such certifications or changes to the rules by the fcc could adversely affect our ability to bring our products to market which could harm our customer relationships and therefore our operating results any failure to obtain the requisite certifications could also harm our operating results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and although we hedge against these risks our attempts to hedge could be unsuccessful and expose us to losses 

a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the us and as such we face exposure to movements in nonus currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse 

impact on our financial results and cash flows fluctuations in currencies impact our operating results which are reported in us dollars 

currently we routinely hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities our attempts to hedge against these risks could be unsuccessful and expose us to losses 

our inability to accurately predict orders and shipments may subject our results of operations to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter 

we have not been able in the past to consistently predict when our customers will place orders and request shipments so we cannot always accurately plan our manufacturing requirements as a result if orders and shipments differ from what we predict we may incur additional expense and build excess inventory which may require additional reserves and allowances accordingly we have limited visibility into future changes in demand and our results of operations may be subject to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter 

we are dependent on a specific manufacturer and assembler for many of our products and on other manufacturers and specific suppliers of critical parts for our products 

we are substantially dependent upon flextronics international limited as our preferred manufacturing partner for many of our gnss products under the agreement we provide to flextronics a twelvemonth product forecast and place purchase orders with flextronics at least thirty calendar days in advance of the scheduled delivery of products to our customers depending on production lead time although purchase orders placed with flextronics are cancelable the terms of the agreement would require us to purchase from flextronics all inventory not returnable or usable by other flextronics customers accordingly if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products we may be unable to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity from flextronics to meet customers’ delivery requirements or we may accumulate excess inventories if such inventories are not usable by other flextronics customers our current contract with flextronics continues in effect until either party gives the other ninety days written notice 

we rely on specific suppliers for a number of our critical components and on other contract manufacturers including benchmark electronics and jabil for the manufacture test and assembly of certain products and components we have experienced shortages of components in the past our current reliance on specific or a limited group of suppliers and contract manufacturers involves risks including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components reduced control over pricing and delivery schedules discontinuation of certain components and economic conditions which may adversely impact the viability of our suppliers and contract manufacturers this situation may be exacerbated during any period of economic recovery or a competitive environment any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture assemble and test such components internally could significantly delay our ability to ship our products which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our reputation and brand as well as our operating results 

we are subject to the secs new rules regarding the use and disclosure of conflict minerals which we expect will increase our operating and compliance costs and could potentially harm our reputation causing a decline in our stock price 

the sec adopted its final rule implementing section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act concerning conflict minerals during august 2012 the goal of the rule is to cut direct and indirect funding of groups engaged in armed conflict and human rights abuses we are committed to compliance with the secs conflict minerals rule and support its intended objective this new rule requires us to 1 determine whether conflict minerals tin tantalum tungsten gold or similar derivatives are used in our products and if so determine if the minerals originated from the democratic republic of congo drc or its immediately adjoining countries and 2 if so conduct due diligence regarding the source and chain of custody of these conflict minerals to determine whether the conflict minerals financed or benefitted armed groups the rule will require us to submit forms and reports to the sec by may 31 2014 and annually thereafter that disclose our determinations and due diligence measures 

trimble does not directly purchase any conflicts minerals tracing these materials back to their country of origin is a complex task that may require us to among other things survey suppliers in our supply chain to understand what programs they have in place for tracing the source of minerals supplied to us or used in products supplied to us and to ensure that reasonable due diligence has been performed presently we have not determined how many or if any of our supply chain partners use conflict minerals in addition to the increased administrative expense required to comply with the new requirements that apply to us we may face a limited pool of suppliers who can provide us “conflictfree” components parts and manufactured products and we may not be able to obtain conflictfree products or supplies in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices for our operations and may be 

required to disclose that our products are not “conflict free” this could adversely affect the company’s reputation and may harm its relationships with business partners and customers and our stock price could suffer as a result 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate which could negatively impact our operations and our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control results in any period could be affected by 

 in addition demand for our products in any quarter or year may vary due to the seasonal buying patterns of our customers in the agricultural and engineering and construction industries the price of our common stock could decline substantially in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors which are based primarily on historical models that are not necessarily accurate representations of the future 

we are dependent on new products and services and if we are unable to successfully introduce them into the market or to effectively compete with new disruptive product alternatives our customer base may decline or fail to grow as anticipated 

our future revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to bring new products and services to market on a timely basis we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products and services enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance of such products and services we may incur problems in the future in innovating and introducing new products and services our development stage products may not be successfully completed or if developed may not achieve significant customer acceptance if we were unable to successfully define develop and introduce competitive new products and services and enhance existing products our future results of operations would be adversely affected development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and we might not achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success if we are unable to introduce new products and services if other companies develop competing technology products and services or if we do not develop compelling new products and services our number of customers may not grow as anticipated or may decline which could harm our operating results in addition many of our products and services are increasingly focused on software and subscription services the software industry is characterized by rapidly changing customer preferences which require us to address multiple delivery platforms new mobile devices and cloud computing life cycles of software products can be short and this can exacerbate the risks associated with developing new products the introduction of thirdparty solutions embodying new disruptive technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could make our existing and future software solutions and other products obsolete or noncompetitive if we are not able to develop software and other solutions that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers or if we are unable to adapt to new technologies or new industry standards that impact our markets our ability to retain or increase market share and revenues could be materially adversely affected 

we are dependent on proprietary technology which could result in litigation that could divert significant valuable resources 

our future success and competitive position is dependent upon our proprietary technology and we rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright law to protect our intellectual property the patents owned or licensed by us may be invalidated circumvented infringed and challenged the rights granted under these patents may not provide competitive advantages to us any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us if at all 

despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain our software or develop software with the same functionality or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology duplicate our technology or design around the patents owned by us in addition effective copyright patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in certain countries the steps taken by us to protect our technology might not prevent the misappropriation of such technology 

the value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many current patent filings thirdparties may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights for example individuals and groups may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from us or our customers the number of these claims has increased in recent periods and may continue to increase in the future we recognize that as new patents are issued or are brought to our attention by the holders of such patents it may be necessary for us to withdraw products from the market take a license from such patent holders or redesign our products in addition the legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant expense of operations any such litigation could require us to incur substantial costs and divert significant valuable resources including the efforts of our technical and management personnel which harm our results of operations and financial condition 

our products may contain undetected errors product defects or software errors which could result in damage to our reputation lost revenue diverted development resources and increased service costs warranty claims and litigation 

we warrant that our products will be free of defect for various periods of time depending on the product in addition certain of our contracts include epidemic failure clauses if invoked these clauses may entitle the customer to return or obtain credits for products and inventory or to cancel outstanding purchase orders even if the products themselves are not defective 

we must develop our products quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing market and we have a history of frequently introducing new products products and services as sophisticated as ours could contain undetected errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new models or versions are released in general our products may not be free from errors or defects after commercial shipments have begun which could result in damage to our reputation lost revenue diverted development resources increased customer service and support costs warranty claims and litigation 

our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war terrorism or civil unrest 

acts of war acts of terrorism cyberattacks or other circumstances of civil unrest especially any directed at the gnss signals or systems could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may invoke a redeployment of the satellites used in gnss or interruptions of the system civil unrest or other political activities may impact regional economies through work stoppages and limitations on foreign business transactions to the extent that such interruptions result in delays or cancellations of orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our products are highly technical and could contain errors defects or security vulnerabilities in addition our information systems or those of our outside vendors may be subject to disruption delays or security incidents that could adversely impact our customers and operations 

our products including our software products are highly technical and complex and when deployed may contain errors defects or security vulnerabilities some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by customers in addition we rely on software that we license from third parties including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions errors viruses or bugs may also be present in software that we license from third parties and incorporate into our products or in third party software that our customers use in conjunction with our software in addition our customers’ proprietary software and network firewall protections may corrupt data from our products and create difficulties in implementing our solutions changes to third party software that our customers use in conjunction with our software could also render our applications inoperable any errors defects or security vulnerabilities in our products or any defects in or compatibility issues with any third party software or customers’ network environments discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition loss of customers theft of our trade secrets data or intellectual property and increased service and warranty cost any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products alone or in combination with third party software could expose them to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could harm our reputation and lead some customers to return products to reduce or delay future purchases or use competitive products 

some of our products rely on third party technologies including open source software so if integration or incompatibility issues arise with these technologies or these technologies become unavailable our product and services development may be delayed our reputation could be harmed and our business could be adversely affected 

we license software technologies and patents underlying some of our software from third parties the third party licenses we rely upon may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all and the software and technologies may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors resulting in development delays some software licenses are subject to annual renewals at the discretion of the licensors in many cases if we were to breach a provision of these license agreements the licensor could terminate the agreement immediately the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such third party software or technology could result in increased costs or delays in software releases or updates until such issues have been resolved this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and future prospects 

we also incorporate open source software into our products although we monitor our use of open source closely the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market or sell our products or to develop new products in such event we could be required to seek licenses from thirdparties in order to continue offering our products to disclose and offer royaltyfree licenses in connection with our own source code to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis any of which could adversely affect our business 

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect an investment in our common stock 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile during fiscal 2013 our stock price ranged from 2466 to 3501 we believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate perhaps substantially including 

 in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of “hightech” companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the market price of our common stock may decline 

our global operations expose us to risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally and our results of operations may be adversely affected by our efforts to comply with us laws which apply to international operations such as the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and us export control laws as well as the laws of other countries 

we operate on a global basis with offices or activities in europe africa asia south america australasia and north america we face several risks inherent in conducting business internationally including compliance with international and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations these laws and regulations include data privacy requirements labor relations laws tax laws anticompetition regulations import and trade restrictions export control laws us laws such as export control laws and the fcpa and similar laws in other countries which also prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers many of our products are subject to us export law restrictions that limit the destinations and types of customers to which our products may be sold or require an export license in connection with sales outside the united states given the high level of complexity of these laws there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently or intentionally breached for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise also we may be held liable for actions taken by our local dealers and partners violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees and prohibitions on the conduct of our business any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more 

countries and could materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our operating results 

in addition we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced significant governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices we may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence or through other methods that us law and regulations prohibit us from using our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties additional challenges for a us company operating in some regions are posed by external extremist parties in some circumstances as a means to promote political ends 

in addition to the foregoing engaging in international business inherently involves a number of other difficulties and risks including 

 these factors or any combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue or our overall financial performance

executive level overview 

trimbles focus is on integrating its broad technological and application capabilities to create systemlevel solutions that transform how work is done within the industries we serve enhancing productivity accuracy safety and regulatory compliance for our customers the majority of our markets are end user markets including engineering and construction firms surveyors farmers governmental organizations energy and utility companies and organizations who must manage fleets of mobile workers and assets we also provide components to original equipment manufacturers to incorporate into their products in the end user markets we provide standalone systems which may consist of software hardware or some combination of the two as well as integrated enterprise or workflow solutions which address the entire work process some examples of our solutions include products that automate and simplify the process of surveying land products that automate the control management and utilization of equipment such as tractors and bulldozers products for engineering or building design construction and operations management products that enable a company to manage its mobile workforce and assets and products that allow municipalities or utilities to manage their fixed assets and operations to achieve distribution marketing production and technology advantages in our targeted markets we manage our operations in the following four segments engineering and construction field solutions mobile solutions and advanced devices 

solutions targeted at the enduser make up a significant majority of our revenue to create compelling products we must attain an understanding of the endusers needs and workflow and of how our broad based technological capabilities can be deployed and integrated to enable that enduser to work faster more efficiently more accurately and more safely we use this knowledge to create highly innovative solutions that change the way work is done by the enduser with the exception of our mobile solutions and advanced devices segments our products are primarily sold through a dealer channel and it is crucial that we maintain a proficient global thirdparty distribution channel 

we continue to execute our strategy with a series of actions across new and existing markets 

reinforcing our position in new and existing markets 

we believe many of our markets continue to be underpenetrated and provide us with additional substantial potential for substituting our technology and solutions for traditional methods we continue to utilize the strength of the trimble brand in our markets to expand our revenue by bringing new products to both new and existing users

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements we consider the accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting policies these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists shipment has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer or is uncertain revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 

contracts andor customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement shipping documents and customer acceptance when applicable are used to verify delivery we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analyses as well as the customer’s payment history 

revenue for orders is generally not recognized until the product is shipped and title has transferred to the buyer we bear all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods up to that point our shipment terms for us orders and international orders fulfilled from our european distribution center typically provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the carrier named by the buyer at the named place or point if no precise point is indicated by the buyer delivery is deemed to occur when the carrier takes the goods into its charge from the place determined by us other shipment terms may provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the buyer shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 

revenue from sales to distributors and dealers is recognized upon shipment assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met distributors and dealers do not have a right of return 

revenue from purchased extended warranty and post contract support pcs agreements is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the warranty or support period revenue from our subscription services related to our hardware and applications is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription service period beginning on the date that service is made available to the customer assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been met 

we present revenue net of sales taxes and any similar assessments 

our software arrangements generally consist of a perpetual license fee and pcs we generally have established vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for our pcs contracts based on the renewal rate the remaining value of the software arrangement is allocated to the license fee using the residual method license revenue is primarily recognized when the software has been delivered and fair value has been established for all remaining undelivered elements in cases where vsoe of fair value for pcs is not established revenue is recognized ratably over the pcs period after all software deliverables have been made and the only the undelivered element is pcs 

some of our subscription product offerings include hardware subscription services and extended warranty under these hosted arrangements the customer typically does not have the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without incurring a significant penalty and it is not feasible for the customer to run the software either on its own hardware or on a thirdparty’s hardware 

our multiple deliverable product offerings include hardware with embedded firmware extended warranty software pcs services and subscription services which are considered separate units of accounting for certain of our products software and nonsoftware components function together to deliver the tangible product’s essential functionality 

in evaluating the revenue recognition for our hardware or subscription agreements which contain multiple deliverable arrangements we determined that in certain instances we were not able to establish vsoe for some or all deliverables in an arrangement as we infrequently sold each element on a standalone basis did not price products within a narrow range or had a limited sales history when vsoe cannot be established we attempt to establish the selling price of each element based on relevant thirdparty evidence tpe tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately generally our gotomarket strategy differs from that of competitors and offerings may contain a significant level of proprietary technology customization or differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained furthermore we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products’ selling prices are on a standalone basis therefore we typically are not able to establish the selling price of an element based on tpe 

when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe we use our best estimate of selling price besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis besp is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a standalone basis or for new or highly customized offerings we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including but not limited to pricing practices market conditions competitive landscape internal costs geographies and gross margin the determination of besp is made through consultation with and formal approval by our management taking into consideration our gotomarket strategy 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

our accounts receivable balance net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns reserve was 3379 million at the end of fiscal 2013 as compared with 3235 million at the end of fiscal 2012 the allowance for doubtful accounts was both 63 million at the end of fiscal 2013 and 2012 we evaluate ongoing collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors such as age of the accounts receivable balances credit quality historical experience and current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us a specific allowance for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad 

debts bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 

inventory valuation 

our inventories net balance was 2543 million  at the end of fiscal 2013  as compared with 2405 million at the end of fiscal 2012  our inventory allowances at the end of fiscal 2013  were 406 million as compared with 403 million at the end of fiscal 2012  our inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or market adjustments are also made to reduce the cost of inventory for estimated excess or obsolete balances factors influencing these adjustments include declines in demand technological changes product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred tax asset or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized 

relative to uncertain tax positions we only recognize the tax benefit if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement our practice is to recognize interest andor penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 

our valuation allowance is primarily attributable to foreign net operating losses and state research and development credit carryforwards management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize these deferred tax assets and accordingly a valuation allowance has been provided for such amounts valuation allowance adjustments associated with an acquisition after the measurement period are recorded through income tax expense 

business combinations 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree generally based on their fair values at the acquisition date the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill 

when determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to expected future cash flows which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins attrition rates future changes in technology and brand awareness loyalty and position and discount rates fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available 

goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination intangible assets acquired individually with a group of other assets or in a business combination are recorded at fair value identifiable intangible assets are comprised of distribution channels and distribution rights patents licenses technology acquired backlog trademarks and inprocess research and development the fair value of intangible assets acquired is generally determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straightline method reflecting the pattern of economic benefits associated with these assets and have estimated useful lives ranging from one to ten years with a weighted average useful life of 64 years goodwill is not subject to amortization but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment applying a fairvalue based test 

impairment of goodwill intangible assets and other longlived assets 

we evaluate goodwill at a minimum on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year based on the values on the first day of that quarter for the annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we chose not to perform the optional qualitative assessment for any of our reporting units instead goodwill was reviewed 

for impairment utilizing a quantitative twostep process in the first step of this test goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit’s carrying amount including goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a discounted cash flow approach if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in step two the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill the difference is recognized as an impairment loss when we perform a quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment the determination of fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions the discounted cash flows are based upon among other things assumptions about expected future operating performance using riskadjusted discount rates actual future results may differ from those estimates as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 for each reporting unit our estimated fair values exceeded the carrying value by substantial margins on a percentage basis this includes the results for certain earlier stage reporting units which due to the smaller magnitude of the carrying value and fair value of each respective reporting unit the margins by which the fair value exceeded the carrying value on an absolute dollar basis were relatively small 

depreciation and amortization of the intangible assets and other longlived assets is provided using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives reflecting the pattern of economic benefits associated with these assets changes in circumstances such as technological advances changes to our business model or changes in the capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives of intangible assets or other longlived assets differing from initial estimates in those cases where we determine that the useful life of an asset should be revised the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value will be depreciated over its revised remaining useful life these assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable based on their future cash flows the estimated future cash flows are based upon among other things assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows the assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value 

warranty costs 

the liability for product warranties was 178 million at the end of fiscal 2013  as compared with 171 million at the end of fiscal 2012  we accrue for warranty costs as part of cost of sales based on associated material product costs technical support labor costs and costs incurred by third parties performing work on our behalf our expected future cost is primarily estimated based upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment the products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to 55 years 

while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates revisions to the estimated warranty accrual and related costs may be required 

stockbased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to our employees and directors based on estimated fair values the grant date fair value for options is estimated using a binomial valuation model the fair value of rights to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plan is estimated using the blackscholes optionpricing model 

the determination of fair value of sharebased payment awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors riskfree interest rates and expected dividends in addition the binomial model incorporates actual optionpricing behavior and changes in volatility over the option’s contractual term 

we base the expected stock price volatility for stock purchase rights on implied volatilities of traded options on our stock and our expected stock price volatility for stock options is based on a combination of our historical stock price volatility for the period commensurate with the expected life of the stock option and the implied volatility of traded options the use of implied volatilities is based upon the availability of actively traded options on our stock with terms similar to our awards and also upon our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility however because the expected life of our stock options is greater than the terms of our traded options we use a combination of our historical stock price volatility commensurate with the expected life of our stock options and implied volatility of traded options 

we estimate the expected life of the awards based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and postvesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the options and purchase rights the riskfree interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the expected term of the awards 

we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future accordingly our expected dividend yield is zero 

stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income for fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures the stockbased compensation guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 

if factors change and we employ different assumptions to determine the fair value of our sharebased payment awards granted in future periods the compensation expense that we record under it may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period in addition valuation models including the blackscholes and binomial models may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stockbased compensation consequently there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stockbased compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise expiration early termination or forfeiture of those stockbased payments in the future certain stockbased payments such as employee stock options may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements alternatively values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements

results of operations 

overview 

the following table is a summary of revenue gross margin and operating income for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

  



basis of presentation 

we have a 5253 week fiscal year ending on the friday nearest to december 31 which for fiscal 2013 was january 3 2014 fiscal 2013 was a 53week year fiscal 2012 and 2011 were both 52week years 

revenue 

in fiscal 2013  total revenue increased by 2480 million  or 12  to 229 billion  from 204 billion  in fiscal 2012  of this increase product revenue increased 830 million  or 5  service revenue increased 1014 million  or 39  and subscription revenue increased 636 million  or 30  the product service and subscription revenue increase in fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  was driven primarily by growth across engineering and construction and mobile solutions which included organic growth as well as the impact of the tmw acquisition the product revenue growth was slightly offset by a decrease in fields solutions revenue primarily due to softness in gis markets we consider organic growth to include all revenue except for revenue associated with acquisitions made within the last four quarters 

on a segment basis the increase in fiscal 2013  was primarily due to stronger results from the engineering and construction and mobile solutions segments engineering and construction revenue increased 1326 million  or 12  mobile solutions increased 1170 million  or 34  and advanced devices increased 65 million  or 5  partially offset by a decrease in field solutions of 81 million  or 2  as compared to fiscal 2012  revenue growth within engineering and construction was driven primarily by organic growth due to global sales of building construction and to a lesser extent heavy civil and survey products in the us and europe mobile solutions revenue increased primarily due to organic growth in the transportation and logistics market as well as acquisitions not applicable in the prior periods including tmw which was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 advanced devices revenue increased primarily due to stronger sales of rfid product solutions field solutions revenue decreased slightly due to softness in gis markets due to economic uncertainties in the us which was partially offset by increased agricultural sales 

in fiscal 2012  total revenue increased by 3960 million  or 24  to 204 billion  from 164 billion  in fiscal 2011  of this increase product revenue increased 2211 million  or 16  service revenue increased 1038 million  or 65  and subscription revenue increased 712 million  or 51  the product and service revenue increase in fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  was driven by organic growth across all segments and acquisitions not applicable in the prior periods including tekla and peoplenet which were both acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 subscription revenue increased primarily due to organic growth in engineering and construction and mobile solutions as well as the peoplenet acquisition 

on a segment basis the increase in fiscal 2012  was primarily due to stronger results from the engineering and construction field solutions and mobile solutions segments engineering and construction revenue increased 1829 million or 20 field solutions increased 682 million or 16 mobile solutions increased 1296 million or 59 and advanced devices increased 153 million or 15 as compared to fiscal 2011 revenue growth within engineering and construction was driven by growth from all main product categories particularly sales of heavy and highway and construction solutions as well as the impact of acquisitions field solutions revenue increased primarily due to continued strength in the agriculture market driven by continued strength in commodity prices and farmer income mobile solutions revenue increased primarily due to peoplenets continued organic growth as well as the incremental impact of the peoplenet acquisition itself which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 to a lesser extent the fourth quarter 2012 tmw acquisition also had an impact on mobile solutions revenue growth advanced devices revenue increased primarily due to unusually stronger sales of timing devices related to cellular infrastructure buildouts 

during fiscal 2013  sales to customers in the united states represented 49 europe represented 23 asia pacific represented 14 and other regions represented 14 of our total revenue during fiscal 2012 sales to customers in the united states represented 47 europe represented 22 asia pacific represented 16 and other regions represented 15 of our total revenue during fiscal 2011 sales to customers in the united states represented 45 europe represented 24 asia pacific represented 15 and other regions represented 16 of our total revenue we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue 

no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenue in fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  it is possible however that in future periods the failure of one or more large customers to purchase products in quantities anticipated by us may adversely affect the results of operations 

gross margin 

our gross margin varies due to a number of factors including product mix pricing distribution channel production volumes new product startup costs and foreign currency translations 

in fiscal 2013  our gross margin increased by 1576 million  as compared to fiscal 2012  primarily due to the increase in total revenue gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 526  in fiscal 2013  and 513  in fiscal 2012  the increase in the gross margin percentage was due to improved product mix in engineering and construction and mobile solutions particularly software software maintenance and subscription revenue due to organic growth as well as the tmw acquisition which was partially offset by higher amortization of purchased intangibles 

in fiscal 2012  our gross margin increased by 2166 million as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to the increase in total revenue gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 513 in fiscal 2012 and 505 in fiscal 2011 the increase in the gross margin percentage was due to improved product mix in engineering and construction field solutions and mobile solutions particularly software software maintenance and subscription revenue which was partially offset by higher amortization of purchased intangibles 

 because of potential product mix changes within and among the industry markets market pressures on unit selling prices fluctuations in unit manufacturing costs including increases in component prices and other factors current level gross margin cannot be assured in the future 

operating income 

operating income increased by  392 million  for fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  operating income as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2013  was 110  as compared to 104  for fiscal 2012  the increase in operating income and operating income percentage was primarily driven by higher revenue and product mix due to higher margin software service and subscription revenue partially offset by higher amortization of purchased intangibles due to acquisitions 

operating income increased by 562 million for fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  operating income as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2012  was 104 as compared to 95 for fiscal 2011  the increase in operating income and operating income percentage was primarily driven by higher revenue and product mix partially offset by higher amortization of purchased intangibles due to acquisitions 

results by segment 

to achieve distribution marketing production and technology advantages in our targeted markets we manage our operations in the following four segments engineering and construction field solutions mobile solutions and advanced devices segment operating income equals net revenue less cost of sales and operating expense excluding general corporate expense amortization of purchased intangible assets amortization of inventory stepup acquisition costs and restructuring charges 

the following table is a breakdown of revenue and operating income by segment for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

  



a reconciliation of our consolidated segment operating income to consolidated income before income taxes follows 

  



unallocated corporate expense includes general corporate expense amortization of inventory stepup and restructuring cost 

engineering and construction 

engineering and construction revenue increased by 1326 million  or 12  while segment operating income increased by 441 million  or 21  for fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  the revenue growth was primarily driven by organic growth in the global sales of building construction and to a lesser extent heavy highway and survey products in markets that were relatively stable sales were strong in the us particularly for building construction products as the residential and commercial construction markets continued to strengthen to a lesser extent europe was also up heavy civil which continued to grow was challenged by the combined effects of the australian recession the lack of european investment and the absence of a solution to us highway funding survey instruments growth was stable segment operating income increased primarily due to higher revenue and product mix including higher margin software service and subscription revenue 

engineering and construction revenue increased by 1829 million or 20 while segment operating income increased by 582 million or 39 for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 the revenue growth was primarily driven by organic growth due to increased sales of heavy civil and building construction products and acquisitions not applicable in the prior periods including tekla which was acquired at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2011 the growth within engineering and construction revenue was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates segment operating income increased primarily due to higher revenue and improved product mix including higher margin software the foreign exchange impact was immaterial to operating income 

field solutions 

field solutions revenue decreased by 81 million  or 2  while segment operating income decreased by 90 million  or 5  for fiscal year 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  the revenue decrease was primarily due to a decline in gis markets which continued to be impacted by the pullback of government funding sources particularly in the us agriculture was moderately up over the prior year weather conditions in the first half of the year particularly in the us resulted in slower than anticipated agriculture sales however sales increased in the second half of the year with relatively strong growth in europe segment operating income decreased due to reduced operating leverage in gis 

field solutions revenue increased by 682 million or 16 while segment operating income increased by 220 million or 14 for fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 there was growth in all major regions in our agriculture markets due to market penetration as a result of demand for new information and flow control products and increased sales presence segment operating income increased primarily due to higher revenue and associated higher gross margin 

mobile solutions 

mobile solutions revenue increased by 1170 million  or 34  while segment operating income increased by 315 million  or 97  for fiscal year 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  the revenue increase was primarily due to organic growth in the transportation and logistics market as well as acquisitions not applicable in the prior periods including tmw which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2012 operating income increased due primarily to increased revenue and product mix including higher software maintenance and subscription revenue 

mobile solutions revenue increased by 1296 million or 59 while segment operating income increased by 280 million or 628 for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 the revenue increase was primarily due to peoplenets continued organic growth as well as acquisitionrelated growth from a partial period of peoplenet results in fiscal 2011 operating income increased due primarily to higher subscription revenue with contributions from peoplenet as well as field service management gross margin expansion and operating leverage 

advanced devices 

advanced devices revenue increased by 65 million  or 5  and segment operating income increased by 74 million  or 39  for fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  the increase in revenue and operating income was primarily driven by increased sales of high margin rfid solutions 

advanced devices revenue increased by 153 million or 15 and segment operating income increased by 53 million or 38 for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 the increase in revenue and operating income was primarily driven by unusually stronger sales of timing devices related to infrastructure buildouts for cellular networks 

research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 

the following table shows research and development “rd” sales and marketing and general and administrative “ga” expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions of those operating expenses below 

  



overall rd sales and marketing and ga expenses increased by approximately 985 million  in fiscal 2013  compared to fiscal 2012  substantially all of our rd costs have been expensed as incurred 

research and development expense increased by  430 million  in fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  overall research and development spending was at approximately 13  of revenue in both fiscal 2013  and 2012  the increase in rd expense in fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  was primarily due to the inclusion of expense of 316 million from acquisitions not applicable in fiscal 2012 a 97 million increase in compensation related expense and a 16 million increase due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates 

research and development expense increased by 595 million in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 overall research and development spending was approximately 13 of revenue in fiscal 2012 and 12 in fiscal 2011 the increase in rd expense in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to the inclusion of expense of 394 million from acquisitions not applicable in fiscal 2011 a 32 million increase in engineering costs associated with new product rollouts a 126 million increase in compensation related expense and a 87 million increase in other expense partially offset by a 44 million decrease due to favorable foreign currency exchange rates 

 we believe that the development and introduction of new products are critical to our future success and we expect to continue active development of new products 

sales and marketing expense increased by 344 million  in fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  spending overall was at approximately 15 of revenue in both fiscal 2013  and 2012  the increase in sales and marketing expense in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012  was primarily due to the inclusion of expense of 249 million from acquisitions not applicable in the prior period an 80 million increase in compensation related expense and a 11 million increase due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates 

sales and marketing expense increased by 469 million in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 spending overall was approximately 15 of revenue in fiscal 2012 compared to 16 in fiscal 2011 the increase in sales and marketing expense in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to the inclusion of expense of 345 million from acquisitions not applicable in the prior period a 128 million increase in compensation related expense and a 53 million increase in other expense including a biannual trade show partially offset by a 57 million decrease due to favorable foreign currency exchange rates 

 our future growth will depend in part on the timely development and continued viability of the markets in which we currently compete as well as our ability to continue to identify and develop new markets for our products 

general and administrative expense increased by  211 million  in fiscal 2013  compared to fiscal 2012  spending overall was at approximately 9 of revenue in fiscal 2013 compared to 10 in fiscal 2012  the increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  was primarily due to the inclusion of expense of 236 million from acquisitions not applicable in the prior year a 30 million increase in tax legal and consulting expense and a 14 million increase in other expense partially offset by a 69 million decrease in nonrecurring acquisition related costs 

general and administrative expense increased by 374 million in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 spending overall was at approximately 10 of revenue in both fiscal 2012 and 2011 the increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to the inclusion of expense of 175 million from acquisitions not applicable in the prior year a 68 million increase in nonrecurring acquisition related costs an 119 million increase in compensation related expense a 48 million increase in tax legal and consulting expense partially offset by a 21 million decrease due to favorable foreign currency exchange rates 

other operating expenses 

amortization of purchased and other intangible assets 

  



total amortization expense of purchased and other intangible assets was 1628 million  in fiscal 2013  of which 811 million  was recorded in cost of sales and 817 million  was recorded in operating expenses total amortization expense of purchased and other intangibles represented 71  of revenue in fiscal 2013  an increase of 371 million  from fiscal 2012  when it represented 62  of revenue the increase was primarily due to the tmw actronic and alk acquisitions and to a lesser extent other acquisitions made in fiscal 2013 as well as fiscal 2012 acquisition intangibles that included a full year impact of amortization expense in fiscal 2013 

total amortization expense of purchased and other intangible assets was 1257 million in fiscal 2012 of which 603 million was recorded in cost of sales and 654 million was recorded in operating expenses total amortization expense of purchased and other intangibles represented 62 of revenue in fiscal 2012 an increase of 398 million from fiscal 2011 when it represented 52 of revenue the increase was primarily due to the tekla peoplenet and sketchup acquisitions and to a lesser extent other acquisitions made in fiscal 2012 as well as fiscal 2011 acquisition intangibles that included a full year impact of amortization expense in fiscal 2012 

nonoperating income net 

the following table shows nonoperating income net for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

  



total nonoperating income net decreased by 157 million  during fiscal 2013  compared with fiscal 2012  the decrease was primarily due to an increase in interest expense due to higher average debt balances outstanding the impact of lower income from equity method investments namely joint ventures and gains on the sale of several investments included in other income net in the prior year partially offset by the impact of foreign currency transaction fluctuations 

total nonoperating income net increased by 58 million during fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 the increase was primarily due to the impact of higher income from equity method investments namely joint ventures and gains on the sale of several 

investments included in other income net partially offset by higher interest expense due to an increase in debt associated with acquisition purchases and the impact of foreign currency transaction fluctuations 

income tax provision 

our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 was 14 17 and 11 respectively the fiscal 2013 rate was less than the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the geographical mix of our pretax income and to a lesser extent the inclusion of the current year us federal rd credit the favorable benefit of the retroactive reinstatement of the 2012 rd credit and the benefit of the tax rate reduction in finland the fiscal 2012 rate was less than the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the geographical mix of our pretax income the fiscal 2011 rate was less than the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the geographical mix of our pretax income and the inclusion of the us federal rd credit 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than lease commitments incurred in the normal course of business see contractual obligations table below we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities guarantee contracts retained or contingent interests in transferred assets or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity we do not have any majorityowned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements additionally we do not have any interest in or relationship with any special purpose entities 

in the normal course of business to facilitate sales of its products we indemnify other parties including customers lessors and parties to other transactions with us with respect to certain matters we have agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties these agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents 

it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under these agreements have not been material and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on the consolidated balance sheets at the end of fiscal 2013 and 2012 

liquidity and capital resources 

  



cash and cash equivalents 

at the end of fiscal 2013  cash and cash equivalents totaled 1472 million  compared to 1578 million  at the end of fiscal 2012  we had debt of 7585 million  at the end of fiscal 2013  compared to 9112 million  at the end of fiscal 2012  

 our ability to continue to generate cash from operations will depend in large part on profitability the rate of collections of accounts receivable our inventory turns and our ability to manage other areas of working capital 

 we believe that our cash and cash equivalents together with borrowings under our 2012 credit facility as described below under the heading “debt” will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs debt service planned capital expenditures and stock purchases under the stock repurchase program for at least the next twelve months 

 we anticipate that planned capital expenditures primarily for continued upgrade of our erp systems as well as computer equipment software manufacturing tools and test equipment and leasehold improvements associated with business expansion will constitute a partial use of our cash resources decisions related to how much cash is used for investing are influenced by the expected amount of cash to be provided by operations 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 4146 million  for fiscal 2013  as compared to 3407 million  for fiscal 2012  the increase of 739 million  was due to an increase in net income before noncash depreciation and amortization primarily attributable to engineering and construction and mobile solutions segments’ increased operating income and to a lesser extent an increase in deferred revenue as well as a decrease in accounts receivable attributable to lower dso partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable due to the timing of payments 

cash provided by operating activities was 3407 million for fiscal 2012 as compared to 2416 million for fiscal 2011 the increase of 991 million was due to an increase in net income before noncash depreciation and amortization primarily attributable to engineering and construction field solutions and mobile solutions segments’ increased operating income and to a lesser extent a decrease in working capital requirements due to higher accounts payable due to the timing of purchases 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 3248 million  for fiscal 2013  as compared to 7643 million  for fiscal 2012  primarily due to cash used for business and intangible asset acquisitions fiscal 2013 acquisitions included alk trade services and other acquisitions fiscal 2012 acquisitions included tmw sketchup and other acquisitions 

cash used in investing activities was 7643 million for fiscal 2012 as compared to 7736 million for fiscal 2011 primarily due to cash used for business and intangible asset acquisitions fiscal 2012 acquisitions included tmw sketchup and other acquisitions fiscal 2011 acquisitions included tekla peoplenet and other acquisitions 

financing activities 

cash used by financing activities was 984 million  for fiscal 2013  as compared to cash provided of 4264 million  during fiscal 2012  the decrease of 5248 million  was primarily due to a decrease in debt proceeds net of repayments slightly offset by an increase in proceeds received from the issuance of common stock related to stock option exercises 

cash provided by financing activities was 4264 million for fiscal 2012 as compared to 4642 million during fiscal 2011 the decrease of 378 million was primarily due to a decrease in debt proceeds net of repayments primarily used for acquisitions slightly offset by an increase in proceeds received from the issuance of common stock related to stock option exercises 

accounts receivable and inventory metrics 

  

accounts receivable days sales outstanding were down at 55 days at the end of fiscal 2013  as compared to 57 days at the end of fiscal 2012  our accounts receivable days sales outstanding are calculated based on ending accounts receivable net divided by revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter times a quarterly average of 91 days due to fiscal 2013 being a 53week year our accounts receivable days sales outstanding for fiscal 2013 is calculated based on ending accounts receivable net divided by revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter times 98 days for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 our inventory turns were both 41 at the end of fiscal 2013 and 2012 our inventory turnover is based on the total cost of sales for the fiscal period over the average inventory for the corresponding fiscal period 

repatriation of foreign earnings and income taxes 

at the end of fiscal 2013 1161 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries if these funds are needed for our operations in the us we would not be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds due to intercompany financing arrangements with our foreign subsidiaries while a significant portion of our foreign earnings continue to be permanently reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries it is anticipated this reinvestment will not impede cash needs at the parent company level in our determination of which foreign earnings are permanently reinvested we consider numerous factors including the financial requirements of the us parent company the financial requirements of the foreign subsidiaries and the tax consequences of remitting the foreign earnings back to the us there are no other material impediments to our ability to access 

sources of liquidity and our resulting ability to meet short and longterm liquidity needs other than in the event we are not in compliance with the covenants under our 2012 credit facility or the potential tax costs of remitting foreign earnings back to the us 

debt 

on november 21 2012 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with a group of lenders the “2012 credit facility” this credit facility provides for unsecured credit facilities in the aggregate principal amount of 14 billion comprised of a fiveyear revolving loan facility of 7000 million and a fiveyear 7000 million term loan facility subject to the terms of the 2012 credit facility the revolving loan facility and the term loan facility may be increased by 3000 million in the aggregate we also have two 75 million uncommitted revolving loan facilities the “uncommitted facilities” which are callable by the bank at any time and have no covenants the interest rate is 09 to 100 plus either libor or the bank’s cost of funds or as otherwise agreed upon by the bank and us 

at the end of fiscal 2013 our total debt was comprised primarily of a term loan of 6650 million  and a revolving credit line of 220 million under the 2012 credit facility and a revolving credit line of 630 million under the uncommitted facilities of the total outstanding balance 6300 million  of the term loan and the 220 million  revolving credit line are classified as longterm in the consolidated balance sheet for additional discussion of our debt see note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

the funds available under the 2012 credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes the financing of certain acquisitions and the payment of transaction fees and expenses related to such acquisitions under the 2012 credit facility we may borrow repay and reborrow funds under the revolving loan facility until its maturity on november 21 2017 at which time the revolving facility will terminate and all outstanding loans together with all accrued and unpaid interest must be repaid amounts not borrowed under the revolving facility will be subject to a commitment fee to be paid in arrears on the last day of each fiscal quarter ranging from 015 to 035 per annum depending on our leverage ratio as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter the term loan will be repaid in quarterly installments with the last quarterly payment to be made on september 29 2017 with the remaining outstanding balance being due and payable at maturity on november 21 2017 on an annualized basis the amortization of the term loan is as follows 5 5 10 10 and 70 for years one through five respectively the term loan may be prepaid in whole or in part subject to certain minimum thresholds without penalty or premium amounts repaid or prepaid with respect to the term loan facility may not be reborrowed 

we may borrow funds under the 2012 credit facility in us dollars euros or in certain other agreed currencies and borrowings will bear interest at our option at either i a floating per annum base rate based on the administrative agents prime rate or other agreedupon rate depending on the currency borrowed plus a margin of between 000 and 100 depending on our leverage ratio as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter or ii a reserveadjusted fixed per annum rate based on libor euribor or other agreedupon rate depending on the currency borrowed plus a margin of between 100 and 200 depending on our leverage ratio as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter interest will be paid on the last day of each fiscal quarter with respect to borrowings bearing interest based on a floating rate or on the last day of an interest period but at least every three months with respect to borrowings bearing interest at a fixed rate our obligations under the 2012 credit facility are guaranteed by several of our domestic subsidiaries 

the 2012 credit facility contains various customary representations and warranties by us which include customary use of materiality material adverse effect and knowledge qualifiers the 2012 credit facility also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including among other requirements negative covenants that restrict our ability to dispose of assets create liens incur indebtedness repurchase stock pay dividends make acquisitions and make investments further the 2012 credit facility contains financial covenants that require the maintenance of minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios specifically we must maintain as of the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of a ebitda as defined in the 2012 credit facility to b interest expenses for the most recently ended period of four fiscal quarters of not less than 3 to 1 we must also maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of x total indebtedness to y ebitda as defined in the 2012 credit facility for the most recently ended period of four fiscal quarters of not greater than 3 to 1 provided that on the completion of a material acquisition we may increase the ratio by 025 for the fiscal quarter during which such acquisition occurred and each of the three subsequent fiscal quarters 

we were in compliance with these covenants at the end of fiscal 2013 

the 2012 credit facility contains events of default that include among others nonpayment of principal interest or fees breach of covenants inaccuracy of representations and warranties cross defaults to certain other indebtedness bankruptcy and insolvency events material judgments and events constituting a change of control upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an 

event of default interest on the obligations will accrue at an increased rate and the lenders may accelerate the companys obligations under the 2012 credit facility except that acceleration will be automatic in the case of bankruptcy and insolvency events of default 

the weighted average interest rate on the current portion of the debt outstanding under the 2012 credit facility and uncommitted facilities was 131 and 196 at the end of fiscal 2013 and 2012 respectively the interest rate on the noncurrent debt outstanding under the 2012 credit facility was 167 and 196 at the end of fiscal 2013 and 2012 respectively 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at the end of fiscal 2013 

  



  

 at the end of fiscal 2013 we had unrecognized tax benefits included in other noncurrent liabilities of 360 million  including interest and penalties at this time we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with tax authorities regarding this liability and therefore such amounts are not included in the contractual obligations table above 

effect of new accounting pronouncements 

the impact of recent accounting pronouncements is disclosed in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

reconciliation of gaap to nongaap financial measures 

our nongaap measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap measures the nongaap financial measures included in the following tables as well as detailed explanations to the adjustments to comparable gaap measures are set forth below 

nongaap gross margin 

we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap gross margin as a way of understanding how product mix pricing decisions and manufacturing costs influence our business nongaap gross margin excludes restructuring costs amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation and amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup from gaap gross margin we believe that these exclusions offer investors additional information that may be useful to view trends in our gross margin performance 

nongaap operating expenses 

we believe this measure is important to investors evaluating our nongaap spending in relation to revenue nongaap operating expenses exclude restructuring costs amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation litigation and acquisitiondivestiture costs associated with external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition activities 

such as legal due diligence integration costs and acquisition bonus payments from gaap operating expenses we believe that these exclusions offer investors supplemental information to facilitate comparison of our operating expenses to our prior results 

nongaap operating income 

we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap operating income trends which are driven by revenue gross margin and spending nongaap operating income excludes restructuring costs amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup litigation and acquisitiondivestiture costs associated with external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition activities such as legal due diligence integration costs and acquisition bonus payments we believe that these exclusions offer an alternative means for our investors to evaluate current operating performance compared to results of other periods 

nongaap nonoperating income net 

we believe this measure helps investors evaluate our nonoperating income trends nongaap nonoperating income net excludes acquisition and divestiture gainslosses associated with unusual acquisition related items such as adjustments to the fair value of earnout liabilities and gains or losses related to the acquisition or sale of certain businesses and investments and a note impairment cost on a potential equity investment these gainslosses are specific to particular acquisitions and divestitures and vary significantly in amount and timing nongaap nonoperating income net also excludes the writeoff of debt issuance costs associated with a terminated or modified credit facility as well as foreign exchange gainslosses specifically associated with hedges for two of our acquisitions we believe that these exclusions provide investors with a supplemental view of our ongoing financial results 

nongaap income tax provision 

nongaap items tax effected adjusts the provision for income taxes to reflect the effect of certain nongaap items on nongaap net income we believe this information is useful to investors because it provides for consistent treatment of the excluded items in our nongaap presentation 

nongaap net income 

this measure provides a supplemental view of net income trends which are driven by nongaap income before taxes and our nongaap tax rate nongaap net income excludes restructuring costs amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisition and divestiture costs a write off of debt issuance costs associated with a terminated or modified credit facility foreign exchange gains losses from hedges associated with two of our acquisitions litigation and nongaap tax adjustments from gaap net income we believe our investors benefit from understanding these exclusions and from an alternative view of our net income performance as compared to our past net income performance 

nongaap diluted net income per share 

we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap operating performance as reflected in a per share calculation as a way of measuring nongaap operating performance by ownership in the company nongaap diluted net income per share excludes restructuring costs amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisition and divestiture costs a write off of debt issuance costs associated with a terminated or modified credit facility foreign exchange gains losses from hedges associated with two of our acquisitions litigation and nongaap tax adjustments from gaap diluted net income per share we believe that these exclusions offer investors a useful view of our diluted net income per share as compared to our past diluted net income per share 

nongaap operating leverage 

we believe this information is beneficial to investors as a measure of how much incremental revenue contributed to our operating income nongaap operating leverage is the increase in nongaap operating income as a percentage of the increase in revenue we believe that this information offers investors supplemental information to evaluate our current performance and to compare to our past nongaap operating leverage 

nongaap segment operating income 

nongaap segment operating income excludes stockbased compensation from gaap segment operating income we believe this information is useful to investors because some may exclude stockbased compensation as an alternative view when assessing trends in the operating income of our segments 

these nongaap measures can be used to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance as well as our performance relative to competitors we believe some of our investors track our “core operating performance” as a means of evaluating our performance in the ordinary ongoing and customary course of our operations core operating performance excludes items that are noncash not expected to recur or not reflective of ongoing financial results management also believes that looking at our core operating performance provides a supplemental way to provide consistency in period to period comparisons accordingly management excludes from nongaap those items relating to restructuring amortization of purchased intangible assets stock based compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisition and divestiture costs foreign exchange gains losses from hedges associated with two of our acquisitions litigation and nongaap tax adjustments for detailed explanations of the adjustments made to comparable gaap measures see items a   k  below 







 49 

assets over may be substantially different from the time period that an internal growth company incurs and recognizes such expenses we believe that by excluding the amortization of purchased intangible assets which primarily represents technology andor customer relationships already developed it provides an alternative way for investors to compare our operations preacquisition to those postacquisitions and to those of our competitors that have pursued internal growth strategies however we note that companies that grow internally will incur costs to develop intangible assets that will be expensed in the period incurred which may make a direct comparison more difficult 

 

 50 

we discuss our operating results by segment with and without stockbased compensation expense as we believe it is useful to investors stockbased compensation not allocated to the reportable segments was approximately 138 million 134 million and 105 million for fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

nongaap operating income 

nongaap operating income increased by 765 million  for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 and increased by 1051 million for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 nongaap operating income as a percentage of total revenue was 207  195 and 178 for fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

the increase in operating income and operating income percentage for 2013 was primarily driven by higher revenue and product mix due to higher margin software service and subscription revenue in engineering and construction and mobile solutions the increase in operating income and operating income percentage for 2012 was primarily driven by higher revenue in engineering and construction field solutions and mobile solutions as well as product mix in engineering and construction

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors 

market interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds treasury bills interest and noninterest bearing bank deposits as well as bank time deposits the main objective of these instruments is safety of principal and liquidity while maximizing return without significantly increasing risk 

 due to the shortterm nature of our cash equivalents we do not anticipate any material effect on our portfolio due to fluctuations in interest rates 

we are exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing interest rates under our credit facilities our 2012 credit facility is comprised of an unsecured term loan and a revolving credit agreement with maturity dates of november 21 2017 and also two unsecured uncommitted revolving credit agreements that are callable by the bank at any time we may borrow funds under these facilities in us dollars or in certain other currencies and borrowings will bear interest as described under note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 at the end of fiscal 2013 our total debt was comprised primarily of a term loan of 6650 million  and a revolving credit line of 220 million under the 2012 credit facility and a revolving credit line of 630 million under the uncommitted facilities a hypothetical 10 increase in our borrowing rates at the end of fiscal 2013 could result in approximately 12 million annual increase in interest expense on the existing principal balances 

 the hypothetical changes and assumptions made above will be different from what actually occurs in the future furthermore the computations do not anticipate actions that may be taken by our management should the hypothetical market changes actually occur over time as a result actual earnings effects in the future will differ from those quantified above 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we operate in international markets which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and various foreign currencies the most significant of which is the euro 

the majority of our revenue contracts are denominated in us dollars with the most significant exception being europe where we invoice primarily in euros additionally a portion of our expenses primarily the cost to manufacture cost of personnel to deliver technical support on our products and professional services sales and sales support and research and development are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the euro canadian dollar swedish krona new zealand dollar british pound and chinese yuan 

revenue resulting from selling in local currencies and costs incurred in local currencies are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which can affect our operating income as exchange rates vary operating income may differ from expectations in fiscal 2013 revenue was positively impacted by foreign currency exchange rates by 113 million the impact to operating income was immaterial 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash and certain trade and intercompany receivables and payables primarily denominated in australian canadian singapore and new zealand dollars japanese yen chinese yuan indian rupee brazilian real south african rand swedish krona swiss franc euro and british pound these contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rate movements as the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses on the forward contracts these instruments are marked to market through earnings every period and generally range from one to three months in original maturity we do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes we occasionally enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase price of some of our larger business acquisitions foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at the end of fiscal 2013 and 2012 are summarized as follows in thousands

business strategy 

our business strategy is developed around an analysis of several key elements 

 

 

 

business segments and markets 

we are organized into four reporting segments encompassing our various applications and product lines engineering and construction field solutions mobile solutions and advanced devices our segments are distinguished by the markets they serve each segment consists of businesses which are responsible for product development marketing sales strategy and financial performance 

engineering and construction 

the engineering and construction segment primarily serves customers working in architecture engineering construction surveying natural resources and government 

in the planning design construction and operationmaintenance of civil infrastructure such as roads railways airports power plants and transmission lines our solutions are used across the entire project lifecycle to improve productivity reduce waste and rework and enable more informed decision making through enhanced situational awareness data flow and project collaboration at the same time our solutions can improve worker safety and reduce environmental impact our suite of integrated products and technologies in this area includes software for optimized route selection and design systems to automatically guide and control construction equipment such as bulldozers graders and paving equipment systems to monitor track and manage assets equipment and workers and software to facilitate the sharing and communication of data in real time together these solutions are designed 

to transform how work is done within the civil engineering industry 

an example is the connected site which integrates data and information across the entire construction process this includes data from site positioning and machine control systems construction asset management equipment and services and various software applications utilizing wireless and internetbased site communications infrastructure trimble connected site solutions include the ability to track and control equipment perform remote machine diagnostics and reduce rework by leveraging the connected site technology contractors gain greater insight into their operations helping them to improve productivity and asset utilization while at the same time lowering costs and improving worker safety 

to bolster the software solutions we provide to the connected site we formed a joint venture with caterpillar in october of 2008 called virtualsite solutions or vss vss develops software for fleet management and connected worksite solutions its initial products are subscriptionbased software solutions that include asset management and machine diagnostics capabilities vss solutions as part of the connected site portfolio are being sold through an independent dealer channel under the name of sitech we expect to have all initially targeted trade areas covered by the end of 2013 a separate joint venture with caterpillar caterpillartrimble control technologies ctct was formed in 2002 to develop the next generation of advanced electronic guidance and control products for earthmoving machines the joint venture develops machine control products that use site design information combined with accurate positioning technology to automatically control dozer blades and other machine tools the joint venture supplies both trimble and caterpillar who each market distribute service and support the products using both companies independent distribution channels caterpillar offers products as a factoryinstalled option while trimble continues to address the aftermarket with products for earthmoving machines from caterpillar and other equipment manufacturers

risk factors 

tableend risks and uncertainties 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k and in any other documents to which we refer you in this form 10k before purchasing our securities the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 

our operating results in each quarter may be affected by special conditions such as seasonality late quarter purchases weather economic conditions and other potential issues 

due in part to the buying patterns of our customers a significant portion of our quarterly revenue occurs from orders received and immediately shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of each quarter although our operating expense tends to remain fairly predictable engineering and construction purchases tend to occur in early spring and governmental agencies tend to utilize funds available at the end of the government’s fiscal year for additional purchases at the end of our third fiscal quarter in september of each year concentrations of orders sometimes also occur at the end of our other two fiscal quarters additionally a majority of our sales force earns commissions on a quarterly basis which may cause concentrations of orders at the end of any fiscal quarter it could harm our operating results if for any reason expected sales are deferred orders are not received or shipments are delayed a few days at the end of a quarter over the last few years we have derived an increasing percentage of our revenue from software revenue recognition for such sales can be complicated and if we are not able to satisfy all of the elements for recognition associated with software sales this could impact the amount of revenue we report in any quarterly period 

in addition our operations and performance depend on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of business spending in the recent past uncertainties in the financial and credit markets have caused our customers to postpone purchases and negative economic conditions may reduce future sales of or demand for our products and services in addition negative economic conditions may depress the tax revenues of federal state and local government entities which are significant purchasers of our products with the exception primarily of our mobile solutions and advanced devices segments our products are generally sold through a dealer channel and our dealers depend on the availability of credit to finance purchases of our products for their inventory additionally any disruption in our supply chain could impact our ability to meet our quarterly revenue 

customer collections are our primary source of cash while we believe we have a strong customer base and have experienced strong collections in the past negative economic conditions may result in increased collection times or greater writeoffs which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow any writeoff of goodwill or intangible assets could also negatively impact our financial results these and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and operating results 

investing in and integrating new acquisitions could be costly and may place a significant strain on our management systems and resources which could negatively impact our operating results 

we have recently acquired a number of companies and intend to continue to acquire other companies acquisitions of companies entail numerous risks including 

 as a result of such acquisitions we have significant assets that include goodwill and other purchased intangibles the testing of this goodwill and intangibles for impairment under established accounting guidelines requires significant use of judgment and assumptions changes in business conditions could require adjustments to the valuation of these assets in addition losses incurred by a company in which we have an investment may have a direct impact on our financial statements or could result in our having to writedown the value of such investment any such problems in integration or adjustments to the value of the assets acquired could harm our growth strategy and could be costly and place a significant strain on our management systems and resources 

companies that we acquire may operate with different cost and margin structures which could further cause fluctuations in our operating results and adversely affect our operating margins 

changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income in future periods 

a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates including 

 we are currently in various stages of multiple year examinations by federal state and foreign taxing authorities including a review of our 2010 and 2011 tax years by the us internal revenue service or irs our effective tax rate is based on the geographic mix of earnings statutory rates intercompany transfer pricing and enacted tax rules if the irs or the taxing authorities of any other jurisdiction were to successfully challenge a material tax position we could become subject to higher taxes and our earnings would be adversely affected 

we are dependent on the availability of allocated bands within the radio frequency spectrum 

our gnss technology is dependent on the use of satellite signals and on terrestrial communication bands international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union itu a specialized technical agency of the united nations these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used in the united states the federal communications commission fcc and the national telecommunications and information administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations 

any itu or local reallocation of radio frequency bands including frequency band segmentation and sharing of spectrum or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our customers for example the fcc has been considering proposals to repurpose spectrum adjacent to the gps bands for terrestrial broadband wireless operations throughout the united states if the fcc were to permit implementation of such proposals or similar proposals terrestrial broadband wireless operations could create harmful interference to gps receivers within range of such operations and impose costs to retrofit or replace affected receivers 

many of our products use other radio frequency bands such as the public land mobile radio bands together with the gnss signal to provide enhanced gnss capabilities such as realtime kinematics precision the continuing availability of these nongnss radio frequencies is essential to provide enhanced gnss products to our precision survey agriculture and construction machine controls markets in addition emissions from other services and equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or inband may impair the utility and reliability of our products any regulatory changes in spectrum allocation or in allowable operating conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we face competition in our markets which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition 

our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price quality and performance of our products the level of customer service the development of new technology and our ability to participate in emerging markets within each of our markets we encounter direct competition from other gnss software optical and laser suppliers and competition may intensify from various larger us and nonus competitors and new market entrants particularly from emerging markets such as china and india in addition as we sell an increasing amount of software and subscription services we face competition from a group of large well established companies with whom we have not previously competed this may require us to rapidly adapt to 

technological and customer preference changes that we have not previously been exposed to including those related to cloud computing mobile devices and new computing platforms the competition in the future may in some cases result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the future against existing and additional competitors will depend largely on our ability to execute our strategy to provide systems and products with significantly differentiated features compared to currently available products we may not be able to implement this strategy successfully and our products may not be competitive with other technologies or products that may be developed by our competitors many of whom have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing sales and other resources than we do 

our debt could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations 

on november 21 2012 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with a group of lenders the “2012 credit facility” this credit facility provides for unsecured credit facilities in the aggregate principal amount of 14 billion comprised of a fiveyear revolving loan facility of 7000 million and a fiveyear 7000 million term loan facility subject to the terms of the 2012 credit facility the revolving loan facility may be increased andor additional term loan commitments may be established in an aggregate principal amount up to 3000 million additionally we have a 75 million uncommitted revolving loan facility which is callable by the bank at any time and has no covenants at the end of fiscal 2012 our total debt was comprised primarily of a term loan of 7000 million  and a revolving credit line of 2080 million  under the 2012 credit facility debt incurred under this agreement could have important consequences such as 

 additionally if we were to default under our amended credit agreement and were unable to obtain a waiver for such a default interest on the obligations would accrue at an increased rate and the lenders could accelerate our obligations under the amended credit agreement that acceleration will be automatic in the case of bankruptcy and insolvency events of default additionally our subsidiaries that have guaranteed the amended credit agreement could be required to pay the full amount of our obligations under the amended credit agreement any such enforcement action on the part of the lenders against us or our subsidiaries would harm our financial condition 

we are subject to the impact of governmental and other similar certifications processes and regulations which could adversely affect our products and our business 

we market certain products that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold for example ce certification for radiated emissions is required for most gnss receiver and data communications products sold in the european community in the future us governmental authorities may propose gps receiver testing and certification for compliance with published gps signal interface or other specifications an inability to obtain any such certifications in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our operating results governmental authorities may also propose other forms of gps receiver performance standards which may limit design alternatives hamper product innovation or impose additional costs some of our products that use integrated radio communication technology require product type certification and some products require an end user to obtain licensing from the fcc for frequencyband usage these are secondary licenses that are subject to certain restrictions an inability or delay in obtaining such certifications or changes to the rules by the fcc could adversely affect our ability to bring our products to market which could harm our customer relationships and therefore our operating results any failure to obtain the requisite certifications could also harm our operating results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and although we hedge against these risks our attempts to hedge could be unsuccessful and expose us to losses 

a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the us and as such we face exposure to movements in nonus currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows fluctuation in currency impacts our operating results 

currently we routinely hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain 

nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities our attempts to hedge against these risks could be unsuccessful and expose us to losses 

we may not be able to enter into or maintain important alliances 

we believe that in certain business opportunities our success will depend on our ability to form and maintain alliances with industry participants such as caterpillar nikon and cnh global our failure to form and maintain such alliances or the preemption of such alliances by actions of competitors will adversely affect our ability to penetrate emerging markets we also utilize dealer networks including those affiliated with some of our strategic allies such as caterpillar and cnh global to market sell and service some of our products disruption of dealer coverage within a specific geographic market could cause difficulties in marketing selling or servicing our products and have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition moreover dealers who carry products that compete with our products may focus their inventory purchases and sales efforts on goods provided by competitors due to industry demand or profitability such inventory adjustments and sourcing decisions can adversely impact our sales financial condition and results of operations if we experience problems from current or future alliances or our dealer network it could harm our operating results and we may not be able to realize value from any such strategic alliances 

our inability to accurately predict orders and shipments may subject our results of operations to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter 

we have not been able in the past to consistently predict when our customers will place orders and request shipments so that we cannot always accurately plan our manufacturing requirements as a result if orders and shipments differ from what we predict we may incur additional expense and build excess inventory which may require additional reserves and allowances accordingly we have limited visibility into future changes in demand and our results of operations may be subject to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter 

we may be unable to replace lost revenue due to customer cancellations or renewals at lower rates 

an increasing portion of our revenue is generated through software maintenance and subscription revenue decreases in maintenance or subscription attach or renewal rates or a decrease in the number of new licenses or hardware sold with subscription services could negatively impact our future revenue and financial results 

our customers have no obligation to renew their agreements for our software maintenance or subscription services after the expiration of their initial contract period which range from one to five years our customers attach and renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the overall global economy the health of their businesses and customer dissatisfaction with our services if customers do not renew their contracts for our products our maintenance and subscription revenue will decline and our financial results will suffer 

a portion of the growth of our maintenance revenue has typically been associated with growth of the number of licenses that we sell any reduction in the number of licenses that we sell even if our customers attach rates do not change will have a negative impact on our future maintenance revenue growth in addition a portion of the growth of our subscription revenue has typically been associated with the growth in the number of hardware sales that we sell in conjunction with the subscription services any reduction in the number of hardware sales will have a negative impact on our future subscription service growth this in turn would impact our business and harm our financial results 

changes to our licensing or subscription renewal programs or bundling of our products could negatively impact the timing of our recognition of revenue 

we continually reevaluate our licensing programs and subscription renewal programs including specific license models delivery methods and terms and conditions to market our current and future products and services we could implement different licensing models in certain circumstances for which we would recognize licensing fees over a longer period including offering additional products in a software as a service model changes to our licensing programs and subscription renewal programs including the timing of the release of enhancements upgrades maintenance releases the term of the contract discounts promotions and other factors could impact the timing of the recognition of revenue for our products related enhancements and services and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

further we may be required to defer the recognition of revenue that we receive from the sale of certain bundled products if we have not established vendor specific objective evidence or vsoe for the undelivered elements in the arrangement in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or gaap a delay in the recognition of revenue from sales of these bundled products may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results and may adversely affect our operating margins 

we are dependent on a specific manufacturer and assembler for many of our products and on other manufacturers and specific suppliers of critical parts for our products 

we are substantially dependent upon flextronics international limited as our preferred manufacturing partner for many of our gnss products under the agreement we provide to flextronics a twelvemonth product forecast and place purchase orders with flextronics at least thirty calendar days in advance of the scheduled delivery of products to our customers depending on production lead time although purchase orders placed with flextronics are cancelable the terms of the agreement would require us to purchase from flextronics all inventory not returnable or usable by other flextronics customers accordingly if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products we may be unable to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity from flextronics to meet customers’ delivery requirements or we may accumulate excess inventories if such inventories are not usable by other flextronics customers our current contract with flextronics continues in effect until either party gives the other ninety days written notice  

we rely on specific suppliers for a number of our critical components and on other contract manufacturers including benchmark electronics and jabil for the manufacture test and assembly of certain products and components we have experienced shortages of components in the past our current reliance on specific or a limited group of suppliers and contract manufacturers involves risks including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components reduced control over pricing and delivery schedules discontinuation of certain components and economic conditions which may adversely impact the viability of our suppliers and contract manufacturers this situation may be exacerbated during any period of economic recovery or a competitive environment any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture assemble and test such components internally could significantly delay our ability to ship our products which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our reputation and brand as well as our operating results 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate which could negatively impact our operations and our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control results in any period could be affected by 

 in addition demand for our products in any quarter or year may vary due to the seasonal buying patterns of our customers in the agricultural and engineering and construction industries the price of our common stock could decline substantially in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors which are based primarily on historical models that are not necessarily accurate representations of the future 

we are dependent on new products and services and if we are unable to successfully introduce them into the market our customer base may decline or fail to grow as anticipated 

our future revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to bring new products and services to market on a timely basis we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products and services enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance of such products and services we may incur problems in the future in innovating and introducing new products and services our development stage products may not be successfully completed or if developed may not achieve significant customer acceptance if we were unable to successfully define develop and introduce competitive new products and services and enhance existing products our future results of operations would be adversely affected development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and we might not achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success if we are unable to introduce new products and services if other companies develop similar technology products and services or if we do not develop compelling new products and services our number of customers may 

not grow as anticipated or may decline which could harm our operating results in addition many of our products and services are increasingly focused on software and subscription services the software industry is characterized by rapidly changing customer preferences which require us to address multiple delivery platforms new mobile devices and cloud computing life cycles of software products can be short and this can exacerbate the risks associated with developing new products 

we are dependent on proprietary technology which could result in litigation that could divert significant valuable resources 

our future success and competitive position is dependent upon our proprietary technology and we rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright law to protect our intellectual property the patents owned or licensed by us may be invalidated circumvented and challenged the rights granted under these patents may not provide competitive advantages to us any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us if at all 

despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain our software or develop software with the same functionality or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology duplicate our technology or design around the patents owned by us in addition effective copyright patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in certain countries the steps taken by us to protect our technology might not prevent the misappropriation of such technology 

the value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many current patent filings we recognize that as new patents are issued or are brought to our attention by the holders of such patents it may be necessary for us to withdraw products from the market take a license from such patent holders or redesign our products in addition the legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant expense of operations any such litigation could require us to incur substantial costs and divert significant valuable resources including the efforts of our technical and management personnel which harm our results of operations and financial condition 

our products may contain undetected errors product defects or software errors which could result in damage to our reputation lost revenue diverted development resources and increased service costs warranty claims and litigation 

we warrant that our products will be free of defect for various periods of time depending on the product in addition certain of our contracts include epidemic failure clauses if invoked these clauses may entitle the customer to return or obtain credits for products and inventory or to cancel outstanding purchase orders even if the products themselves are not defective 

we must develop our products quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing market and we have a history of frequently introducing new products products and services as sophisticated as ours could contain undetected errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new models or versions are released in general our products may not be free from errors or defects after commercial shipments have begun which could result in damage to our reputation lost revenue diverted development resources increased customer service and support costs warranty claims and litigation 

many of our products rely on gnss technology gps and other satellite systems which may become inoperable and result in lost revenue 

gnss technology gps satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage many of the gps satellites currently in orbit were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of 31 satellites in place over a third have already been in operation for more than 15 years on average to repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites a reduction in the number of operating satellites below the 24satellite standard established for gps may impair the utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities gps satellites and ground control segments are being modernized gps modernization software updates can cause problems we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of gps updates 

as the principal gnss currently in operation we are dependent on continued operation of gps gps is operated by the u s government which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps however if the policy were to change and gps were no longer supported by the u s government or if user fees were imposed it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

many of our products also use signals from systems that augment gps such as the wide area augmentation system and national differential gps system and satellites transmitting signal corrections data on mobile satellite services frequencies utilized by our omnistar corrections services some of these augmentation systems are operated by the federal government and rely on continued funding and maintenance of these systems in addition some of our products also use satellite signals from the russian glonass 

system any curtailment of the operating capability of these systems or discontinuance of service could result in decreased user capability thereby impacting our markets 

the european community is developing an independent radio navigation satellite system known as galileo although we have a commercial license to market and sell receivers capable of receiving the galileo open service signal european authorities in the future may decide to offer other premium or encrypted service signals under different licenses even though an operational galileo system is several years away if we are unable to develop a timely commercial product or obtain a timely license to future galileo service signals it could result in lost revenue which could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war terrorism or civil unrest 

acts of war acts of terrorism cyberattacks or other circumstances of civil unrest especially any directed at the gnss signals or systems could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may invoke a redeployment of the satellites used in gnss or interruptions of the system civil unrest or other political activities may impact regional economies through work stoppages and limitations on foreign business transactions to the extent that such interruptions result in delays or cancellations of orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our products are highly technical and some of our software relies on third party technologies including open source software so if integration or incompatibility issues arise with these technologies these technologies become unavailable or our products contain errors defects or security vulnerabilities our product and services development may be delayed our reputation could be harmed and our business could be adversely affected 

our products including our software products are highly technical and complex and when deployed may contain errors defects or security vulnerabilities some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by customers in addition we rely on software that we license from third parties including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions errors viruses or bugs may also be present in software that we license from third parties and incorporate into our products or in third party software that our customers use in conjunction with our software in addition our customers’ proprietary software and network firewall protections may corrupt data from our products and create difficulties in implementing our solutions changes to third party software that our customers use in conjunction with our software could also render our applications inoperable any errors defects or security vulnerabilities in our products or any defects in or compatibility issues with any third party software or customers’ network environments discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition loss of customers theft of our trade secrets data or intellectual property and increased service and warranty cost any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products alone or in combination with third party software could expose them to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could harm our reputation and lead some customers to return products to reduce or delay future purchases or use competitive products 

the third party software licenses we rely upon may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all and the software may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors resulting in development delays some of these software licenses are subject to annual renewals at the discretion of the licensors in many cases if we were to breach a provision of these license agreements the licensor could terminate the agreement immediately we license technologies and patents underlying some of our software from third parties and the loss of these licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such third party software could result in increased costs or delays in software releases or updates until such issues have been resolved this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and future prospects 

we also incorporate open source software into our products although we monitor our use of open source closely the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market or sell our products or to develop new products in such event we could be required to seek licenses from thirdparties in order to continue offering our products to disclose and offer royaltyfree licenses in connection with our own source code to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis any of which could adversely affect our business 

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect an investment in our common stock 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile during fiscal 2012 our stock price ranged from 3981 to 5983 we believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate perhaps substantially including 

 in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of “hightech” companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the market price of our common stock may decline 

our information systems or those of our outside vendors may be subject to disruption delays or security incidents that could adversely impact our customers and operations 

we rely on our information systems and those of third parties for things such as processing customer orders delivery of products providing services and support to our customers billing and tracking our customers hosting and managing customer data and otherwise running our business any disruption in our information systems and those of the third parties upon whom we rely could have a significant impact on our business 

a security incident in our own systems or the systems of our third party providers may compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of our own internal data the availability of our products and websites designed to support our customers or our customer data unauthorized access to our proprietary business information or customer data may be obtained through breakins breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party employee theft or misuse breach of the security of the networks of our third party providers or other misconduct it is also possible that unauthorized access to customer data may be obtained through inadequate use of security controls by customers while our products and services provide and support strong password controls ip restriction and other security mechanisms the use of such mechanisms are controlled in many cases by our customers 

we may also experience delays or interruptions caused by a number of factors including access to the internet the failure of our network or software systems or significant variability in visitor traffic on our product websites it is also possible that hardware or software failures or errors in our systems or in those of our third party providers could result in data loss or corruption or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our customers regard as significant these failures and interruptions could harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers 

although our systems have been designed around industrystandard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks cyberattacks computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks human error hardware or software defects or malfunctions including defects or malfunctions of components of our systems that are supplied by thirdparty service providers and similar events or disruptions some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities our systems are also subject to breakins sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism despite any precautions we may take the occurrence of a natural disaster a decision by any of our thirdparty hosting providers to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could cause system interruptions and delays and result in loss of critical data and lengthy interruptions in our services 

our global operations expose us to risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally and our results of operations may be adversely affected by our efforts to comply with us laws which apply to international operations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and us export control laws as well as the laws of other countries 

we operate on a global basis with offices or activities in europe africa asia south america australasia and north america we face several risks inherent in conducting business internationally including compliance with international and us laws and 

regulations that apply to our international operations these laws and regulations include data privacy requirements labor relations laws tax laws anticompetition regulations import and trade restrictions export control laws us laws such as export control laws and the fcpa and similar laws in other countries which also prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers many of our products are subject to us export law restrictions that limit the destinations and types of customers to which our products may be sold or require an export license in connection with sales outside the united states given the high level of complexity of these laws there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently breached for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise also we may be held liable for actions taken by our local partners violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees and prohibitions on the conduct of our business any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our operating results 

in addition we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced significant governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices we may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence or through other methods that us law and regulations prohibit us from using our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties 

in addition to the foregoing engaging in international business inherently involves a number of other difficulties and risks including 

 these factors or any combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue or our overall financial performance

executive level overview 

trimbles focus is on integrating its broad technological and application capabilities to create systemlevel solutions that transform how work is done within the industries we serve enhancing productivity accuracy safety and regulatory compliance for our customers the majority of our markets are enduser markets including engineering and construction firms surveyors farmers governmental organizations energy and utility companies and organizations who must manage fleets of mobile workers and assets we also provide components to original equipment manufacturers to incorporate into their products in the end user markets we provide standalone systems which may consist of software hardware or some combination of the two as well as integrated enterprise or workflow solutions which address the entire work process some examples of our solutions include products that automate and simplify the process of surveying land products that automate the control management and utilization of equipment such as tractors and bulldozers products for engineering or building design construction and operations management products that enable a company to manage its mobile workforce and assets and products that allow municipalities or utilities to manage their fixed assets and operations to achieve distribution marketing production and technology advantages in our targeted markets we manage our operations in the following four segments engineering and construction field solutions mobile solutions and advanced devices 

solutions targeted at the enduser make up a significant majority of our revenue to create compelling products we must attain an understanding of the end users needs and work flow and of how our broad based technological capabilities can be deployed and integrated to enable that end user to work faster more efficiently more accurately and more safely we use this knowledge to create highly innovative solutions that change the way work is done by the enduser with the exception of our mobile solutions and advanced devices segments our products are primarily sold through a dealer channel and it is crucial that we maintain a proficient global thirdparty distribution channel 

we continue to execute our strategy with a series of actions across new and existing markets 

reinforcing our position in new and existing markets 

we believe many of our markets continue to be underpenetrated and provide us with additional substantial potential for substituting our technology for traditional methods we continue to utilize the strength of the trimble brand in our markets to expand our revenue by bringing new products to both new and existing users 

in our engineering and construction segment during the year we acquired sketchup one of the most popular 3d modeling tools in the world which allows modelers worldwide across a wide range of industries to express design concepts easily accurately and efficiently subsequently we were able to extend our bimtofield capabilities for building contractors by launching the first integration of sketchup file import capabilities into the trimble field link layout software trimble field link now allows contractors to take their 3d sketchup pro models from the office into the field for quick site verification and viability testing of the proposed prototype we demonstrated our leadership in technology innovation by introducing the trimble r10 gnss system which is our next generation stateoftheart gnss surveying solution it is the smallest and lightest receiver in its class yet combines powerful features and groundbreaking technologies 

in our field solutions segment the agriculture division introduced four new innovations designed to assist growers with planting and spreading operationsvehicle sync seed monitoring capability application management of up to two variable rate products and spinner speed control these innovations enable enhanced grower efficiency by increasing the quality of seed placement and providing realtime wireless communication between vehicles in the field furthermore we launched the connected farm application for smartphone platforms which gives farmers an easytouse tool to capture field data for later viewing and analysis online while also providing agronomists with access to additional data they can use to better assess the needs of their customers 

in our mobile solutions segment our acquisition of trucking industry enterprise software tmw systems will further expand our transportation and logistics reach tmws software capability spans the entire surface transportation lifecycle delivering visibility control and decision support for the intricate relationships and complex processes involved in the movement of freight tmws enterprise software currently integrates with trimbles tl solutions on many fleets and when combined will jointly serve more than 3000 fleets around the world

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements we consider the accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting policies these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

revenue recognition 

we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists shipment has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer or is uncertain revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 

contracts andor customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement shipping documents and customer acceptance when applicable are used to verify delivery we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analyses as well as the customer’s payment history 

revenue for orders is generally not recognized until the product is shipped and title has transferred to the buyer we bear all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods up to that point our shipment terms for us orders and international orders fulfilled from our european distribution center typically provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the carrier named by the buyer at the named place or point if no precise point is indicated by the buyer delivery is deemed to occur when the carrier takes the goods into its charge from the place determined by us other shipment terms may provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the buyer shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 

revenue from sales to distributors and resellers is recognized upon shipment assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met distributors and resellers do not have a right of return 

revenue from purchased extended warranty and post contract support pcs agreements is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the warranty or support period 

we present revenue net of sales taxes and any similar assessments 

our software arrangements generally consist of a perpetual license fee and pcs we generally have established vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for our pcs contracts based on the renewal rate the remaining value of the software arrangement is allocated to the license fee using the residual method license revenue is primarily recognized when the software has been delivered and fair value has been established for all remaining undelivered elements 

some of our subscription product offerings include hardware subscription services and extended warranty under these hosted arrangements the customer typically does not have the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without incurring a significant penalty and it is not feasible for the customer to run the software either on its own hardware or on a thirdparty’s hardware upfront fees related to our hosted solutions typically consist of amounts for the invehicle enabling hardware device and peripherals 

our multiple deliverable product offerings include hardware with embedded firmware extended warranty software pcs services and subscription services which are considered separate units of accounting for certain of our products software and nonsoftware components function together to deliver the tangible product’s essential functionality 

in evaluating the revenue recognition for our hardware or subscription agreements which contain multiple deliverable arrangements we determined that in certain instances we were not able to establish vsoe for some or all deliverables in an arrangement as we infrequently sold each element on a standalone basis did not price products within a narrow range or had a limited sales history when vsoe cannot be established we attempt to establish the selling price of each element based on relevant thirdparty evidence tpe tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately generally our gotomarket strategy differs from that of competitors and offerings may contain a significant level of proprietary technology customization or differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained furthermore we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products’ selling prices are on a standalone basis therefore we typically are not able to establish the selling price of an element based on tpe 

when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe we use our best estimate of selling price besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis besp is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a standalone basis or for new or highly customized offerings we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including but not limited to pricing practices market conditions competitive landscape internal costs geographies and gross margin the determination of besp is made through consultation with and formal approval by our management taking into consideration our gotomarket strategy 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

our accounts receivable balance net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns reserve was 3235 million at the end of fiscal 2012 as compared with 2752 million at the end of fiscal 2011 the allowance for doubtful accounts was 63 million and 67 million at the end of fiscal 2012 and 2011 respectively we evaluate ongoing collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors such as age of the accounts receivable balances credit quality historical experience and current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us a specific allowance for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 

inventory valuation 

our inventories net balance was 2405 million  at the end of fiscal 2012 as compared with 2321 million at the end of fiscal 2011 our inventory allowances at the end of fiscal 2012 were 403 million as compared with 376 million at the end of fiscal 2011 our inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or market adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value if required are made for estimated excess or obsolescence balances factors influencing these adjustments include decline in demand technological changes product life cycle 

and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues if actual factors are less favorable than those projected by us additional inventory writedowns may be required 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred tax asset or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized 

relative to uncertain tax positions we only recognize the tax benefit if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement our practice is to recognize interest andor penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 

our valuation allowance is primarily attributable to net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize these deferred tax assets and accordingly a valuation allowance has been provided for such amounts valuation allowance adjustments associated with an acquisition after the measurement period are recorded through income tax expense 

goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination intangible assets acquired individually with a group of other assets or in a business combination are recorded at fair value identifiable intangible assets are comprised of distribution channels and distribution rights patents licenses technology acquired backlog trademarks and inprocess research and development the fair value of intangible assets acquired is generally determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straightline method reflecting the pattern of economic benefits associated with these assets and have estimated useful lives ranging from one to ten years with a weighted average useful life of 65 years goodwill is not subject to amortization but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment applying a fairvalue based test 

impairment of goodwill intangible assets and other longlived assets 

we evaluate goodwill at a minimum on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year based on the values on the first day of that quarter goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing a twostep process however the provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangibles allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test for our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we performed a quantitative test for all of our reporting units in the first step of this test goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit’s carrying amount including goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a discounted cash flow approach if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in step two the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill the difference is recognized as an impairment loss when we perform a quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment the determination of fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions the discounted cash flows are based upon among other things assumptions about expected future operating performance using riskadjusted discount rates actual future results may differ from those estimates as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 for each reporting unit our estimated fair values exceeded the carrying value by substantial margins on a percentage basis however for certain earlier stage reporting units due to the smaller magnitude of the carrying value and fair value of each respective reporting units the margins by which the fair value exceeded the carrying value on an absolute dollar basis were relatively small 

depreciation and amortization of the intangible assets and other longlived assets is provided using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives reflecting the pattern of economic benefits associated with these assets changes in circumstances such as technological advances changes to our business model or changes in the capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives of intangible assets or other longlived assets differing from initial estimates in those cases where we determine that the useful life of an asset should be revised the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value will be depreciated over its revised remaining useful life these assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable based on their future cash flows the estimated future cash flows are based upon among other things assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash 

flows the assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value 

warranty costs 

the liability for product warranties was 171 million at the end of fiscal 2012 as compared with 184 million at the end of fiscal 2011 we accrue for warranty costs as part of cost of sales based on associated material product costs technical support labor costs and costs incurred by third parties performing work on our behalf our expected future cost is primarily estimated based upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment the products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to 55 years 

while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates revisions to the estimated warranty accrual and related costs may be required 

stockbased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to our employees and directors based on estimated fair values the grant date fair value for options is estimated using a binomial valuation model the fair value of rights to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plan is estimated using the blackscholes optionpricing model 

the determination of fair value of sharebased payment awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors riskfree interest rates and expected dividends in addition the binomial model incorporates actual optionpricing behavior and changes in volatility over the option’s contractual term 

we base the expected stock price volatility for stock purchase rights on implied volatilities of traded options on our stock and our expected stock price volatility for stock options is based on a combination of our historical stock price volatility for the period commensurate with the expected life of the stock option and the implied volatility of traded options the use of implied volatilities is based upon the availability of actively traded options on our stock with terms similar to our awards and also upon our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility however because the expected life of our stock options is greater than the terms of our traded options we use a combination of our historical stock price volatility commensurate with the expected life of our stock options and implied volatility of traded options 

we estimate the expected life of the awards based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and postvesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the options and purchase rights the riskfree interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the expected term of the awards 

we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future accordingly our expected dividend yield is zero 

stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income for fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures the stockbased compensation guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 

if factors change and we employ different assumptions to determine the fair value of our sharebased payment awards granted in future periods the compensation expense that we record under it may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period in addition valuation models including the blackscholes and binomial models may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stockbased compensation consequently there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stockbased compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise expiration early termination or forfeiture of those stockbased payments in the future certain stockbased payments such as employee stock options may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements alternatively values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements

results of operations 

overview 

the following table is a summary of revenue gross margin and operating income for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

  



basis of presentation 

we have a 5253 week fiscal year ending on the friday nearest to december 31 which for fiscal 2012 was december 28 2012 fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 were all 52week years 

revenue 

beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 we have presented revenue separately for products services and subscriptions prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 

in fiscal 2012 total revenue increased by 3960 million  or 24  to 204 billion  from 164 billion  in fiscal 2011 of this increase product revenue increased 2211 million  or 16  service revenue increased 1038 million  or 65  and subscription revenue increased 712 million  or 51  the product and service revenue increase in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was driven by organic growth and acquisitions not applicable in the prior periods including tekla and peoplenet which were both acquired in the third quarter of 2011 subscription revenue increased primarily due to organic growth and peoplenet 

on a segment basis the increase in fiscal 2012 was primarily due to stronger results from the engineering and construction field solutions and mobile solutions segments engineering and construction revenue increased 1829 million  or 20  field solutions increased 682 million  or 16  mobile solutions increased 1296 million  or 59  and advanced devices increased 153 million  or 15  as compared to fiscal 2011 revenue growth within engineering and construction was driven by growth from all main product categories particularly sales of heavy and highway and vertical construction solutions as well as the impact of acquisitions field solutions revenue increased primarily due to continued strength in the agriculture market driven by continued strength in commodity prices and farmer income and to a lesser extent a full year of revenue from tekla mobile solutions revenue increased primarily due to peoplenets continued organic growth as well as the incremental impact of the peoplenet acquisition itself which closed in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 to a lesser extent the fourth quarter 2012 tmw acquisition also had an impact on mobile solutions revenue growth advanced devices revenue increased primarily due to unusually stronger sales of timing devices related to cellular infrastructure buildouts and to a lesser extent stronger sales of embedded devices 

in fiscal 2011 total revenue increased by 3501 million  or 27  to 164 billion from 129 billion in fiscal 2010 of this increase product revenue increased 2555 million  or 23  service revenue increased 499 million  or 46  and subscription revenue increased 448 million  or 47  the product and service revenue increase in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was driven by organic growth and acquisitions not applicable in the prior periods including tekla and peoplenet which were both acquired in the third quarter of 2011 subscription revenue increased primarily due to organic growth and peoplenet 

on a segment basis the increase in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to stronger results from the engineering and construction and field solutions segments engineering and construction revenue increased 1874 million or 26 field solutions increased 956 million or 30 mobile solutions increased 643 million or 41 and advanced devices increased 28 million or 3 as compared to fiscal 2010 revenue growth within engineering and construction was driven by strong organic growth due to expanded distribution improved end user markets and acquisitions including tekla sales were strong in the us and europe for heavy and highway and survey products additionally field solutions revenue increased primarily due to the increased demand 

for agricultural products as relatively high commodity prices led to good farmer income and spending mobile solutions revenue increased primarily due to the peoplenet acquisition and growth within the existing business partially offset by the loss of a large customer in the second quarter of 2010 

 during fiscal 2012 sales to customers in the united states represented 47 europe represented 22 asia pacific represented 16 and other regions represented 15 of our total revenue during fiscal 2011 sales to customers in the united states represented 45 europe represented 24 asia pacific represented 15 and other regions represented 16 of our total revenue during the 2010 fiscal year sales to customers in the united states represented 46 europe represented 22 asia pacific represented 18 and other regions represented 14 of our total revenue we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue 

 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenue in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 it is possible however that in future periods the failure of one or more large customers to purchase products in quantities anticipated by us may adversely affect the results of operations 

gross margin 

our gross margin varies due to a number of factors including product mix pricing distribution channel production volumes new product startup costs and foreign currency translations 

in fiscal 2012 our gross margin increased by 2166 million  as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to the increase in total revenue gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 513  in fiscal 2012 and 505 in fiscal 2011 the increase in the gross margin percentage was due to improved product mix in engineering and construction field solutions and mobile solutions particularly software software maintenance and subscription revenue which was partially offset by higher amortization of purchased intangibles 

in fiscal 2011 our gross margin increased by 1841 million as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to the increase in total revenue gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 505 in fiscal 2011 and 499 in fiscal 2010 the increase in gross margin percentage was primarily due to an increase in sales of higher margin products primarily software and subscription revenue which were partially offset by higher amortization of purchased intangibles 

 because of potential product mix changes within and among the industry markets market pressures on unit selling prices fluctuations in unit manufacturing costs including increases in component prices and other factors current level gross margin cannot be assured in the future 

operating income 

operating income increased by  562 million  for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 operating income as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2012 was 104  as compared to 95  for fiscal 2011 the increase in operating income and operating income percentage was primarily driven by higher revenue and associated gross margin partially offset by higher amortization of purchased intangibles due to acquisitions 

operating income increased by 288 million for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 operating income as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2011 was 95 as compared to 99 for fiscal 2010 the increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher revenue and associated gross margin the decrease in operating income percentage was primarily due to higher amortization of purchased intangibles due to acquisitions 

results by segment 

to achieve distribution marketing production and technology advantages in our targeted markets we manage our operations in the following four segments engineering and construction field solutions mobile solutions and advanced devices operating income equals net revenue less cost of sales and operating expense excluding general corporate expense amortization of purchased intangible assets amortization of inventory stepup acquisition costs and restructuring charges 

the following table is a breakdown of revenue and operating income by segment for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

  



a reconciliation of our consolidated segment operating income to consolidated income before income taxes follows 

  



unallocated corporate expense includes general corporate expense amortization of inventory stepup and restructuring cost 

engineering and construction 

engineering and construction revenue increased by 1829 million  or 20  while segment operating income increased by 582 million  or 390  for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 the revenue growth was primarily driven by organic growth due to increased sales of heavy and highway and vertical construction products and acquisitions not applicable in the prior periods including tekla which was acquired at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2011 the growth within engineering and construction was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates segment operating income increased primarily due to higher revenue improved gross margin due to greater software sales and increased operating leverage the foreign exchange impact was immaterial to operating income 

engineering and construction revenue increased by 1874 million or 26 while segment operating income increased by 381 million or 343 for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 the revenue growth was primarily driven by strong organic growth due to expanded distribution and improved end user markets and acquisitions including tekla sales were strong in the us and europe for heavy and highway and survey products although residential and commercial construction was flat in the us and most parts of europe and china sales slowed products sales associated with infrastructure build out were strong operating income increased primarily due to higher revenue higher gross margin and increased operating leverage 

field solutions 

field solutions revenue increased by 682 million  or 16  while segment operating income increased by 220 million  or 137  for fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 there was growth in all major regions in our agriculture markets due to market penetration as a result of demand for new information and flow control products and increased sales presence and to a lesser extent tekla segment operating income increased primarily due to higher revenue and associated higher gross margin 

field solutions revenue increased by 956 million or 30 while segment operating income increased by 438 million or 376 for fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 the revenue growth was primarily due to higher sales across the world for our agricultural products as relatively high commodity prices increased farmer income and spending sales for agricultural products were robust across the americas europe and asia pacific regions additionally gis contributed to strong field solutions revenue due to the new product introductions and the tekla acquisition operating income increased primarily due to higher revenue higher gross margin and increased operating leverage 

mobile solutions 

mobile solutions revenue increased by 1296 million  or 59  while segment operating income increased by 280 million  or 6276  for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 the revenue increase was primarily due to peoplenets continued organic growth as well as acquisitionrelated growth from a partial period of peoplenet results in fiscal 2011 operating income increased due to primarily higher subscription revenue with contributions from peoplenet as well as field service management gross margin expansion and operating leverage 

mobile solutions revenue increased by 643 million or 41 while segment operating income increased by 26 million or 1382 for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 the revenue increase was primarily due to acquisitions including peoplenet and growth within the existing business partially offset by a loss of a large customer in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 operating income increased primarily due to the peoplenet acquisition and organic growth 

advanced devices 

advanced devices revenue increased by 153 million  or 15  and segment operating income increased by 53 million  or 380  for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 the increase in revenue and operating income was primarily driven by unusually stronger sales of timing devices related to infrastructure buildouts for cellular networks and to a lesser extent stronger sales of embedded devices 

advanced devices revenue increased by 28 million or 3 and segment operating income decreased by 44 million or 242 for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 the increase in revenue was driven by new product introductions within applanix and acquisition revenue partially offset by a reduction in demand for gpsbased timing and synchronization devices the decrease in operating income was primarily driven by product mix and acquisitions 

research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 

the following table shows research and development “rd” sales and marketing and general and administrative “ga” expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions of those operating expenses below 

  



overall rd sales and marketing and ga expenses increased by approximately 1438 million  in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 

research and development expense increased by  595 million  in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 substantially all of our rd costs have been expensed as incurred overall research and development spending was approximately 13  of revenue in fiscal 2012 and 12  in fiscal 2011 the increase in rd expense in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to the inclusion of expense of 394 million from acquisitions not applicable in fiscal 2011 a 32 million increase in engineering costs associated with new product rollouts a 126 million increase in compensation related expense and a 87 million increase in other expense partially offset by a 44 million decrease due to favorable foreign currency exchange rates 

research and development expense increased by 469 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 overall research and development spending was approximately 12 of revenue in fiscal 2011 and 11 in fiscal 2010 the increase in rd expense in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to the inclusion of expense of 278 million from acquisitions not applicable in fiscal 2010 a 80 million increase in engineering costs associated with new product rollouts a 49 million increase in compensation related expense a 36 million increase due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and a 26 million increase in other expenses 

 we believe that the development and introduction of new products are critical to our future success and we expect to continue active development of new products 

sales and marketing expense increased by 469 million  in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 spending overall was approximately 15 of revenue in fiscal 2012 compared to 16 in fiscal 2011 the increase in sales and marketing expense in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to the inclusion of expense of 345 million from acquisitions not applicable in the prior period a 128 million increase in compensation related expense and a 53 million increase in other expense including a biannual trade show partially offset by a 57 million decrease due to favorable foreign currency exchange rates 

sales and marketing expense increased by 517 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 spending overall was approximately 16 of revenue in fiscal 2011 compared to 17 in fiscal 2010 the increase in sales and marketing expense in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to the inclusion of expense of 359 million from acquisitions not applicable in fiscal 2010 a 120 million increase in compensation related expense a 45 million increase due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates partially offset by a 07 million decrease in other expenses 

 our future growth will depend in part on the timely development and continued viability of the markets in which we currently compete as well as our ability to continue to identify and develop new markets for our products 

general and administrative expense increased by  374 million  in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 spending overall was at approximately 10 of revenue in both fiscal 2012 and 2011 the increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due the inclusion of expense of 175 million from acquisitions not applicable in the prior year a 68 million increase in nonrecurring acquisition related costs an 119 million increase in compensation related expense a 48 million increase in tax legal and consulting expense partially offset by a 21 million decrease due to favorable foreign currency exchange rates and a 02 million decrease in other expense 

general and administrative expense increased by 400 million in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 spending overall was at approximately 10 of revenue in fiscal 2011 compared to 9 in fiscal 2010 the increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to the inclusion of expense of 193 million from acquisitions not applicable in fiscal 2010 an 84 million increase in nonrecurring acquisition related costs a 40 million increase in tax legal and consulting expense a 19 million increase in compensation related expense a 15 million increase due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates a 13 million increase in travel expense and a 35 million increase in other expenses 

other operating expenses 

amortization of purchased and other intangible assets 

  



total amortization expense of purchased and other intangible assets was 1257 million  in fiscal 2012 of which 603 million  was recorded in cost of sales and 654 million  was recorded in operating expenses total amortization expense of purchased and other intangibles represented 62  of revenue in fiscal 2012 an increase of 398 million  from fiscal 2011 when it represented 52  of revenue the increase was primarily due to the tekla peoplenet and sketchup acquisitions and to a lesser extent other 

acquisitions made in fiscal 2012 as well as fiscal 2011 acquisition intangibles that included a full year impact of amortization expense in fiscal 2012 

total amortization expense of purchased and other intangible assets was 852 million in fiscal 2011 of which 365 million was recorded in cost of sales and 487 million was recorded in operating expenses total amortization expense of purchased and other intangibles represented 52 of revenue in fiscal 2011 an increase of 275 million from fiscal 2010 when it represented 45 of revenue the increase was primarily due to the tekla and peoplenet acquisitions and to a lesser extent other acquisitions made in fiscal 2011 as well as fiscal 2010 acquisition intangibles that included a full year impact of amortization expense in fiscal 2011 

nonoperating income net 

the following table shows nonoperating income net for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

  



total nonoperating income net increased by 58 million  during fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 the increase was primarily due to the impact of higher income from equity method investments namely joint ventures and a gain on the sale of an investment included in other income net partially offset by higher interest expense due to an increase in debt associated with acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency transaction fluctuations 

total nonoperating income net decreased by 24 million during fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 the decrease was primarily due to an increase in interest expense due to an increase in debt associated with acquisitions and a reduction in deferred compensation plan asset gains and losses included in other income net offset by the impact of foreign currency transaction gain primarily related to foreign exchange hedges associated with two of our larger acquisitions and the impact of higher income from equity method investments 

income tax provision 

our effective income tax rate for fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 was 17 11 and 27 respectively the 2012 rate was less than the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the geographical mix of our pretax income the 2011 rate was less than the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the geographical mix of our pretax income and the inclusion of the us federal rd credit the 2010 rate was less than the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the geographical mix of our pretax income and valuation allowance release offset by the net impact of the us internal revenue service irs 2005 through 2007 audit settlement in 2010 

the federal research and development credit expired on december 31 2011 on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was signed into law under this act the federal research and development credit was retroactively extended for amounts paid or incurred after december 31 2011 and before january 1 2014 the effects of these changes in the tax law will result in a tax benefit which will be recognized in the first quarter of 2013 which is the quarter in which the law was enacted 

litigation matters 

 from time to time we are involved in litigation arising out of the ordinary course of our business there are no known claims or pending litigation that are expected to have a material effect on our overall financial position results of operations or liquidity 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than lease commitments incurred in the normal course of business see contractual obligations table below we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities guarantee contracts retained or contingent interests in transferred assets or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity we do not have any majorityowned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements additionally we do not have any interest in or relationship with any special purpose entities 

in the normal course of business to facilitate sales of its products we indemnify other parties including customers lessors and parties to other transactions with us with respect to certain matters we have agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties these agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents 

it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under these agreements were not material and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on the consolidated balance sheets at the end of fiscal 2012 and 2011 

liquidity and capital resources 

  



cash and cash equivalents 

at the end of fiscal 2012 cash and cash equivalents totaled 1578 million  compared to 1546 million  at the end of fiscal 2011 we had debt of 9112 million  at the end of fiscal 2012 compared to 5644 million  at the end of fiscal 2011 

 our ability to continue to generate cash from operations will depend in large part on profitability the rate of collections of accounts receivable our inventory turns and our ability to manage other areas of working capital 

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents together with borrowings under our 2012 credit facility as described below under the heading “debt” will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs debt service planned capital expenditures and stock purchases under the stock repurchase program for at least the next twelve months 

 we anticipate that planned capital expenditures primarily for the building of a facility in westminster colorado which began in 2012 and an upgrade of our oracle erp system as well as computer equipment software manufacturing tools and test equipment and leasehold improvements associated with business expansion will constitute a partial use of our cash resources decisions related to how much cash is used for investing are influenced by the expected amount of cash to be provided by operations 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 3407 million  for fiscal 2012 as compared to 2416 million  for fiscal 2011 the increase of 991 million  was due to an increase in net income before noncash depreciation and amortization primarily attributable to engineering and construction field solutions and mobile solutions segments’ increased revenue and to a lesser extent a decrease in working capital requirements due to higher accounts payable due to the timing of purchases 

cash provided by operating activities was 2416 million for fiscal 2011 as compared to 1240 million for fiscal 2010 the increase of 1176 million was due to an increase in net income before noncash depreciation and amortization primarily attributable to engineering and construction and field solutions segments’ increased revenue offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to higher revenue from engineering and construction and field solutions segments additionally fiscal 2010 included the payment of income taxes payable associated with the irs tax settlement which is not applicable in fiscal 2011 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 7643 million  for fiscal 2012 as compared to 7736 million  for fiscal 2011 primarily due to cash used for business and intangible asset acquisitions fiscal 2012 acquisitions included tmw sketchup and other acquisitions fiscal 2011 acquisitions included tekla peoplenet and other acquisitions 

cash used in investing activities was 7736 million for fiscal 2011 as compared to 1564 million for fiscal 2010 the increase of 6172 million was primarily due to higher cash used for business and intangible asset acquisitions in fiscal 2011 with the largest cash requirement due to the tekla acquisition 

financing activities 

cash provided by financing activities was 4264 million  for fiscal 2012 as compared to 4642 million  during fiscal 2011 the decrease of 378 million  was primarily due to a decrease in debt proceeds net of repayments primarily used for acquisitions slightly offset by an increase in proceeds received from the issuance of common stock related to stock option exercises 

cash provided by financing activities was 4642 million for fiscal 2011 as compared to cash used of 202 million during fiscal 2010 the increase of 4843 million was primarily due to an increase in debt proceeds net of repayments primarily used for acquisitions partially offset by the repurchase of common stock during fiscal 2010 which was not applicable in 2011 

accounts receivable and inventory metrics 

  



accounts receivable days sales outstanding were down at 57 days at the end of fiscal 2012 as compared to 58 days at the end of fiscal 2011 our accounts receivable days sales outstanding are calculated based on ending accounts receivable net divided by revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter times a quarterly average of 91 days our inventory turns were 41 at the end of fiscal 2012 as compared to 38 at the end of fiscal 2011 our inventory turnover is based on the total cost of sales for the fiscal period over the average inventory for the corresponding fiscal period 

repatriation of foreign earnings and income taxes 

a significant portion of our foreign earnings continue to be permanently reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries and it is anticipated this reinvestment will not impede cash needs at the parent company level in our determination of which foreign earnings are permanently reinvested we consider numerous factors including the financial requirements of the us parent company the financial requirements of the foreign subsidiaries and the tax consequences of remitting the foreign earnings back to the us there are no other material impediments to our ability to access sources of liquidity and our resulting ability to meet short and longterm liquidity needs other than in the event we are not in compliance with the covenants under our 2012 credit facility or the tax costs of remitting foreign earnings back to the us 

debt 

on november 21 2012 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with a group of lenders the “2012 credit facility” this credit facility provides for unsecured credit facilities in the aggregate principal amount of 14 billion comprised of a fiveyear revolving loan facility of 7000 million and a fiveyear 7000 million term loan facility subject to the terms of the 2012 credit facility the revolving loan facility may be increased andor additional term loan commitments may be established in an aggregate principal amount up to 3000 million additionally the company has a 75 million uncommitted revolving loan facility the 2011 uncommitted facility which is callable by the bank at any time and has no covenants the interest rate on the 2011 uncommitted facility is 100 plus either libor or the banks cost of funds or as otherwise agreed upon by the bank and us 

at the end of fiscal 2012 our total debt was comprised primarily of a term loan of 7000 million  and a revolving credit line of 2080 million  under the 2012 credit facility of the total outstanding balance 6650 million  of the term loan and the 2080 million  revolving credit line are classified as longterm in the consolidated balance sheet for additional discussion of our debt see note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

the funds available under the 2012 credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes the financing of certain acquisitions and the payment of transaction fees and expenses related to such acquisitions under the 2012 credit facility we may borrow repay and reborrow funds under the revolving loan facility until its maturity on november 21 2017 at which time the revolving facility will terminate and all outstanding loans together with all accrued and unpaid interest must be repaid amounts not 

borrowed under the revolving facility will be subject to a commitment fee to be paid in arrears on the last day of each fiscal quarter ranging from 015 to 035 per annum depending on our leverage ratio as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter the term loan will be repaid in quarterly installments with the last quarterly payment to be made at september 29 2017 with the remaining outstanding balance being due and payable on november 21 2017 on an annualized basis the amortization of the term loan is as follows 5 5 10 10 and 70 for years one through five respectively the term loan may be prepaid in whole or in part subject to certain minimum thresholds without penalty or premium amounts repaid or prepaid with respect to the term loan facility may not be reborrowed 

we may borrow funds under the 2012 credit facility in us dollars euros or in certain other agreed currencies and borrowings will bear interest at our option at either i a floating per annum base rate based on the administrative agents prime rate or other agreedupon rate depending on the currency borrowed plus a margin of between 000 and 100 depending on the companys leverage ratio as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter or ii a reserveadjusted fixed per annum rate based on libor euribor or other agreedupon rate depending on the currency borrowed plus a margin of between 100 and 200 depending on our leverage ratio as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter interest will be paid on the last day of each fiscal quarter with respect to borrowings bearing interest based on a floating rate or on the last day of an interest period but at least every three months with respect to borrowings bearing interest at a fixed rate our obligations under the 2012 credit facility are guaranteed by several of our domestic subsidiaries 

the 2012 credit facility contains various customary representations and warranties by us which include customary use of materiality material adverse effect and knowledge qualifiers the 2012 credit facility also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including among other requirements negative covenants that restrict our ability to dispose of assets create liens incur indebtedness repurchase stock pay dividends make acquisitions and make investments further the 2012 credit facility contains financial covenants that require the maintenance of minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios specifically we must maintain as of the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of a ebitda as defined in the 2012 credit facility to b interest expenses for the most recently ended period of four fiscal quarters of not less than 35 to 1 we must also maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of x total indebtedness to y ebitda as defined in the 2012 credit facility for the most recently ended period of four fiscal quarters of not greater than the applicable ratio set forth in the table below provided that on the completion of a material acquisition we may increase the applicable ratio in the table below by 025 for the fiscal quarter during which such acquisition occurred and each of the three subsequent fiscal quarters 

  



we were in compliance with these covenants at the end of fiscal 2012 

the 2012 credit facility contains events of default that include among others nonpayment of principal interest or fees breach of covenants inaccuracy of representations and warranties cross defaults to certain other indebtedness bankruptcy and insolvency events material judgments and events constituting a change of control upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default interest on the obligations will accrue at an increased rate and the lenders may accelerate our obligations under the 2012 credit facility however that acceleration will be automatic in the case of bankruptcy and insolvency events of default 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at the end of fiscal 2012 

  



  

 at the end of fiscal 2012 we had unrecognized tax benefits included in other noncurrent liabilities of 223 million  including interest and penalties at this time we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with tax authorities regarding this liability and therefore such amounts are not included in the contractual obligations table above 

effect of new accounting pronouncements 

the impact of recent accounting pronouncements is disclosed in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

reconciliation of gaap to nongaap financial measures 

our nongaap measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap measures the nongaap financial measures included in the following table are set forth below 

nongaap gross margin 

we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap gross margin as a way of understanding how product mix pricing decisions and manufacturing costs influence our business nongaap gross margin excludes restructuring costs amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation and amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup from gaap gross margin we believe that these exclusions offer investors additional information that may be useful to view trends in our gross margin performance 

nongaap operating expenses 

we believe this measure is important to investors evaluating our nongaap spending in relation to revenue nongaap operating expenses exclude restructuring costs amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation and acquisition costs associated with external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition activities such as legal due diligence integration costs and acquisition bonus payments from gaap operating expenses we believe that these exclusions offer investors supplemental information to facilitate comparison of our operating expenses to our prior results 

nongaap operating income 

we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap operating income trends which are driven by revenue gross margin and spending nongaap operating income excludes restructuring costs amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup and acquisition costs associated with external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition activities such as legal due diligence integration costs and acquisition bonus payments we believe that these exclusions offer an alternative means for our investors to evaluate current operating performance compared to results of other periods 

nongaap nonoperating income net 

we believe this measure helps investors evaluate our nonoperating income trends nongaap nonoperating income net excludes acquisition and divestiture gains associated with unusual acquisition related items such as an adjustment to a gain on bargain purchase resulting from the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired exceeding the consideration transferred adjustments to the fair value of earnout liabilities and gains related to sale of certain businesses and investments these gains are specific to particular acquisitions and divestitures and vary significantly in amount and timing nongaap nonoperating income net also excludes the writeoff of debt issuance costs associated with a terminated or modified credit facility as well as foreign exchange gains losses specifically associated with hedges for two of our acquisitions we believe that these exclusions provide investors with a supplemental view of our ongoing financial results 

nongaap income tax provision 

investors benefit from the exclusion of an irs settlement because it facilitates comparisons to our past income tax provisions nongaap income tax provisions exclude an irs settlement and a valuation allowance release from gaap income tax provision and includes nongaap items tax effected nongaap items tax effected adjusts the provision for income taxes to reflect the effect of certain nongaap items on nongaap net income we believe this information is useful to investors because it provides for consistent treatment of the excluded items in our nongaap presentation 

nongaap net income 

this measure provides a supplemental view of net income trends which are driven by nongaap income before taxes and our nongaap tax rate nongaap net income excludes restructuring costs amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisition and divestiture costs a writeoff of debt issuance costs associated with a terminated or modified credit facility foreign exchange gains losses from hedges associated with two acquisitions and nongaap tax adjustments from gaap net income we believe our investors benefit from understanding these exclusions and from an alternative view of our net income performance as compared to our past net income performance 

nongaap diluted net income per share 

we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap operating performance as reflected in a per share calculation as a way of measuring nongaap operating performance by ownership in the company nongaap diluted net income per share excludes restructuring costs amortization of purchased intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisition and divestiture costs a writeoff of debt issuance costs associated with a terminated or modified credit facility foreign exchange gains losses from hedges associated with two acquisitions and nongaap tax adjustments from gaap diluted net income per share we believe that these exclusions offer investors a useful view of our diluted net income per share as compared to our past diluted net income per share 

nongaap operating leverage 

we believe this information is beneficial to investors as a measure of how much incremental revenue is contributed to our operating income nongaap operating leverage is the increase in nongaap operating income as a percentage of the increase in revenue we believe that this information offers investors supplemental information to evaluate our current performance and to compare to our past nongaap operating leverage 

nongaap segment operating income 

nongaap segment operating income excludes stockbased compensation from gaap segment operating income we believe this information is useful to investors because some may exclude stockbased compensation as an alternative view when assessing trends in the operating income of our segments 

these nongaap measures can be used to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance as well as our performance relative to competitors we believe some of our investors track our “core operating performance” as a means of evaluating our performance in the ordinary ongoing and customary course of our operations core operating performance excludes items that are noncash not expected to recur or not reflective of ongoing financial results management also believes that looking at our core operating performance provides a supplemental way to provide consistency in period to period comparisons accordingly management excludes from nongaap those items relating to restructuring amortization of purchased intangible assets stock based compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisition and divestiture costs a writeoff of debt issuance costs associated with a terminated or modified credit facility foreign exchange gains losses from hedges associated with two acquisitions and nongaap tax adjustments for detailed explanations of the adjustments made to comparable gaap measures see items a—l below

to investors stockbased compensation not allocated to the reportable segments was approximately 134 million 105 million and 79 million for fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

nongaap operating income 

nongaap operating income increased by 1051 million  for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 and increased by 745 million for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 nongaap operating income as a percentage of total revenue was 195  178 and 168 for fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

the increase in operating income for 2012 was primarily driven by higher revenue in engineering and construction field solutions and mobile solutions the increase in the operating income percentage for 2012 was primarily driven by higher operating leverage in engineering and construction and mobile solutions the increase in the operating income and operating income percentage for 2011 was primarily driven by higher revenue and associated operating leverage in engineering and construction and field solutions

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors 

market interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds treasury bills interest and noninterest bearing bank deposits as well as bank time deposits the main objective of these instruments is safety of principal and liquidity while maximizing return without significantly increasing risk 

 due to the shortterm nature of our cash equivalents we do not anticipate any material effect on our portfolio due to fluctuations in interest rates 

we are exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing interest rates under our credit facilities our 2012 credit facility is comprised of an unsecured term loan and a revolving credit agreement with maturity dates of november 21 2017 and also an unsecured uncommitted revolving credit agreement that is callable by the bank at any time we may borrow funds under these facilities in us dollars or in certain other currencies and borrowings will bear interest as described under note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 at the end of fiscal 2012 our total debt was comprised primarily of a term loan of 7000 million  and a revolving credit line of 2080 million  under the 2012 credit facility a hypothetical 10 increase in our borrowing rates at the end of fiscal 2012 could result in approximately 18 million annual increase in interest expense on the existing principal balances 

 the hypothetical changes and assumptions made above will be different from what actually occurs in the future furthermore the computations do not anticipate actions that may be taken by our management should the hypothetical market changes actually occur over time as a result actual earnings effects in the future will differ from those quantified above 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we operate in international markets which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and various foreign currencies the most significant of which is the euro 

historically the majority of our revenue contracts are denominated in us dollars with the most significant exception being europe where we invoice primarily in euros additionally a portion of our operating expenses primarily the cost to manufacture cost of personnel to deliver technical support on our products and professional services sales and sales support and research and development are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the euro swedish krona new zealand dollar and canadian dollar revenue resulting from selling in local currencies and costs incurred in local currencies are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which can affect our operating income as exchange rates vary operating income may differ from expectations in fiscal 2012 revenue was negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange rates by 302 million the impact to operating income was immaterial 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash and certain trade and intercompany receivables and payables primarily denominated in australian canadian singapore and new zealand dollars japanese yen indian rupee south african rand swedish krona swiss franc euro and british pound these contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rate movements as the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses on the forward contracts these instruments are marked to market through earnings every period and generally range from one to three months in original maturity we do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes we occasionally enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase price of some of our larger business acquisitions foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at the end of fiscal 2012 and 2011 are summarized as follows in thousands

technology overview 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from applying global navigation satellite system or gnss technology to terrestrial applications the gnss includes the network of 24 orbiting us global positioning system or gps radio navigation satellites and associated ground control that is funded and maintained by the us government and is available worldwide free of direct user fees and the russian glonass radio navigation satellite system both the european community and china are in the process of establishing operational radio navigation satellite systems gnss positioning is based on a technique that precisely measures distances from four or more satellites the satellites continuously transmit precisely timed radio signals using extremely accurate atomic clocks a gnss receiver measures distances from the satellites in view by determining the travel time of a signal from the satellite to the receiver and then uses those distances to compute its position under normal circumstances a standalone gnss receiver is able to calculate its position at any point on earth in the earth’s atmosphere or in lower earth orbit to approximately 10 meters 24 hours a day much better accuracies are possible through a technique called “differential gnss” in addition to providing position gnss provides extremely accurate time measurement 

  

gnss accuracy is dependent upon the locations of the receiver and the number of gnss satellites that are above the horizon at any given time reception of gnss signals requires lineofsight visibility between the satellites and the receiver which can be blocked by buildings hills and dense foliage the receiver must have a line of sight to at least four satellites to determine its latitude longitude and time the accuracy of gnss may also be limited by distortion of gnss signals from ionospheric and other atmospheric conditions 

our gnss products are based on proprietary receiver technology over time the advances in positioning wireless communications and information technologies have enabled us to add more capability to our products and thereby deliver more value to our users gps is being modernized and glonass modernization is planned for example the developments in wireless technology and deployments of next generation wireless networks have enabled less expensive wireless communications these developments provide the efficient transfer of position data to locations away from the positioning field device allowing the data to be accessed by more users thereby increasing productivity this allows us to integrate visualization and design software into some of our systems as well as offer positioning services all of which make our customers more efficient at what they do 

our laser and optical products either measure distances and angles to provide a position in three dimensional space or are used as highly accurate laser references from which a position can be established the key elements of these products are typically a laser which is generally a commercially available laser diode and a complex mechanical assembly these elements are augmented by software algorithms to provide measurements and applicationspecific solutions 

our software products deliver solutions to our customers to optimize their business processes and workflows to improve productivity our software products range from field service and location oriented solutions on handheld and other small footprint devices to scaleable serverbased solutions that integrate field data with enterprise back office applications and to domainspecific tools that assist the design and build process these software solutions are built on configurable and enterprisegrade scalable platforms that can be tailored to the workflows that our customers follow to implement their customized business processes they also integrate various field devices and data collection points to provide a connected view of various field assets and activities we complement our core offerings with other elective software that are delivered as either licensed software or in a hosted environment using software as a service or saas model our mobile resource management suite of products is a subscriptionbased saas offering our software products whether they run on a device on a backend server behind the firewall or in our hosting center allow our customers to derive the best results out of our gnss laser optical and handheld products

 item 1a risk factors 

risks and uncertainties 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k and in any other documents to which we refer you in this form 10k before purchasing our securities the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 

our operating results in each quarter may be affected by special conditions such as seasonality late quarter purchases weather economic conditions and other potential issues 

due in part to the buying patterns of our customers a significant portion of our quarterly revenue occurs from orders received and immediately shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of each quarter although our operating expense tends to remain fairly predictable engineering and construction purchases tend to occur in early spring and governmental agencies tend to utilize funds available at the end of the government’s fiscal year for additional purchases at the end of our third fiscal quarter in september of each year concentrations of orders sometimes also occur at the end of our other two fiscal quarters additionally a majority of our sales force earns commissions on a quarterly basis which may cause concentrations of orders at the end of any fiscal quarter it could harm our operating results if for any reason expected sales are deferred orders are not received or shipments are delayed a few days at the end of a quarter 

in addition our operations and performance depend on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of business spending in the recent past uncertainties in the financial and credit markets have caused our customers to postpone purchases and negative economic conditions may reduce future sales of or demand for our products and services in addition negative economic conditions may depress the tax revenues of federal state and local government entities which are significant purchasers of our products with the exception primarily of our mobile solutions and advanced devices segments our products are generally sold through a dealer channel and our dealers depend on the availability of credit to finance purchases of our products for their inventory additionally any disruption in our supply chain could impact our ability to meet our quarterly revenue 

customer collections are our primary source of cash while we believe we have a strong customer base and have experienced strong collections in the past negative economic conditions may result in increased collection times or greater writeoffs which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow any writeoff of goodwill could also negatively impact our financial results these and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and operating results 

investing in and integrating new acquisitions could be costly and may place a significant strain on our management systems and resources which could negatively impact our operating results 

we have recently acquired a number of companies and intend to continue to acquire other companies acquisitions of companies entail numerous risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 as a result of such acquisitions we have significant assets that include goodwill and other purchased intangibles the testing of this goodwill and intangibles for impairment under established accounting guidelines requires significant use of judgment and assumptions changes in business conditions could require adjustments to the valuation of these assets in addition losses incurred by a company in which we have an investment may have a direct impact on our financial statements or could result in our having to writedown the value of such investment any such problems in integration or adjustments to the value of the assets acquired could harm our growth strategy and could be costly and place a significant strain on our management systems and resources 

changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income in future periods 

a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we are currently in various stages of multiple year examinations by federal state and foreign taxing authorities including a review of our 2010 tax year by the us internal revenue service or irs our effective tax rate is based on the geographic mix of earnings statutory rates intercompany transfer pricing and enacted tax rules if the irs or the taxing authorities of any other jurisdiction were to successfully challenge a material tax position we could become subject to higher taxes and our earnings would be adversely affected 

we are dependent on the availability of allocated bands within the radio frequency spectrum 

our gnss technology is dependent on the use of satellite signals and on terrestrial communication bands international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union itu a specialized technical agency of the united nations these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used in the united states the federal communications commission fcc and the national telecommunications and information administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations 

  

any itu or local reallocation of radio frequency bands including frequency band segmentation and sharing of spectrum or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our customers for example the fcc has been considering a proposal by a private party lightsquared to repurpose spectrum adjacent to the gps bands for terrestrial broadband wireless operations throughout the united states if the fcc were to permit implementation of lightsquared’s proposal or similar proposals terrestrial broadband wireless operations could create harmful interference to gps receivers within range of such operations and impose costs to retrofit or replace affected receivers 

many of our products use other radio frequency bands such as the public land mobile radio bands together with the gnss signal to provide enhanced gnss capabilities such as realtime kinematics precision the continuing availability of these nongnss radio frequencies is essential to provide enhanced gnss products to our precision survey agriculture and construction machine controls markets in addition emissions from other services and equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or inband may impair the utility and reliability of our products any regulatory changes in spectrum allocation or in allowable operating conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have certain products such as gnss rtk systems and surveying and mapping systems that use integrated radio communication technology requiring access to available radio frequencies allocated to local government some bands are experiencing congestion in the us the fcc announced that it will require migration of radio technology from wideband to narrowband operations in these bands the rules require by 2013 either migration of users to narrowband channels or utilization by users of technology that achieves equivalent efficiency to narrowband channels congestion in the channels could cause fcc coordinators to restrict or refuse licenses an inability to obtain access to these radio frequencies by end users could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we face competition in our markets which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition 

our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price quality and performance of our products the level of customer service the development of new technology and our ability to participate in emerging markets within each of our markets we encounter direct competition from other gnss software optical and laser suppliers and competition may intensify from various larger us and nonus competitors and new market entrants particularly from emerging markets such as china and india the competition in the future may in some cases result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the future against existing and additional competitors will depend largely on our ability to execute our strategy to provide systems and products with significantly differentiated features compared to currently available products we may not be able to implement this strategy successfully and our products may not be competitive with other technologies or products that may be developed by our competitors many of whom have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing sales and other resources than we do 

we are subject to the impact of governmental and other similar certifications and failure to obtain the requisite certifications could harm our operating results 

we market certain products that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold for example ce certification for radiated emissions is required for most gnss receiver and data communications products sold in the european community in the future us governmental authorities may propose gps receiver testing and certification for compliance with published gps signal interface specifications an inability to obtain any such certifications in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our operating 

  

results governmental authorities may also propose other forms of gps receiver standards which may limit design alternatives hamper product innovation or impose additional costs some of our products that use integrated radio communication technology require product type certification and some products require an end user to obtain licensing from the fcc for frequencyband usage these are secondary licenses that are subject to certain restrictions an inability or delay in obtaining such certifications or changes to the rules by the fcc could adversely affect our ability to bring our products to market which could harm our customer relationships and therefore our operating results any failure to obtain the requisite certifications could also harm our operating results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and although we hedge against these risks our attempts to hedge could be unsuccessful and expose us to losses 

a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the us and as such we face exposure to movements in nonus currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows fluctuation in currency impacts our operating results 

currently we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities our attempts to hedge against these risks could be unsuccessful and expose us to losses 

our debt could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations 

on may 6 2011 we entered into a new credit agreement or our 2011 credit facility with a group of lenders this credit facility provides for unsecured credit facilities in the aggregate principal amount of 11 billion comprised of a fiveyear revolving loan facility of 7000 million and a fiveyear 4000 million term loan facility additionally on july 14 2011 we entered into a 50 million uncommitted revolving loan facility or 2011 uncommitted facility which is callable by the bank at any time and has no covenants at the end of fiscal 2011 our total debt was comprised primarily of a term loan of 3850 million and a revolving credit line of 1333 million under the 2011 credit facility and a revolving credit line of 440 million under the 2011 uncommitted facility debt incurred under this agreement could have important consequences such as 

 

  

  

  

 additionally if we were to default under our amended credit agreement and were unable to obtain a waiver for such a default interest on the obligations would accrue at an increased rate and the lenders could accelerate our obligations under the amended credit agreement that acceleration will be automatic in the case of bankruptcy and insolvency events of default additionally our subsidiaries that have guaranteed the amended credit agreement could be required to pay the full amount of our obligations under the amended credit agreement any such action on the part of the lenders against us would harm our financial condition 

  

we may not be able to enter into or maintain important alliances 

we believe that in certain business opportunities our success will depend on our ability to form and maintain alliances with industry participants such as caterpillar nikon and cnh global our failure to form and maintain such alliances or the preemption of such alliances by actions of competitors or us will adversely affect our ability to penetrate emerging markets we also utilize dealer networks including those affiliated with some of our strategic allies such as caterpillar and cnh global to market sell and service some of our products disruption of dealer coverage within a specific geographic market could cause difficulties in marketing selling or servicing our products and have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition moreover dealers who carry products that compete with our products may focus their inventory purchases and sales efforts on goods provided by competitors due to industry demand or profitability such inventory adjustments and sourcing decisions can adversely impact our sales financial condition and results of operations if we experience problems from current or future alliances or our dealer network it could harm our operating results and we may not be able to realize value from any such strategic alliances 

our inability to accurately predict orders and shipments may subject our results of operations to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter 

we have not been able in the past to consistently predict when our customers will place orders and request shipments so that we cannot always accurately plan our manufacturing requirements as a result if orders and shipments differ from what we predict we may incur additional expense and build excess inventory which may require additional reserves and allowances accordingly we have limited visibility into future changes in demand and our results of operations may be subject to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter 

we are dependent on a specific manufacturer and assembler for many of our products and on other manufacturers and specific suppliers of critical parts for our products 

we are substantially dependent upon flextronics international limited as our preferred manufacturing partner for many of our gnss products under the agreement we provide to flextronics a twelvemonth product forecast and place purchase orders with flextronics at least thirty calendar days in advance of the scheduled delivery of products to our customers depending on production lead time although purchase orders placed with flextronics are cancelable the terms of the agreement would require us to purchase from flextronics all inventory not returnable or usable by other flextronics customers accordingly if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products we may be unable to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity from flextronics to meet customers’ delivery requirements or we may accumulate excess inventories if such inventories are not usable by other flextronics customers our current contract with flextronics continues in effect until either party gives the other ninety days written notice  

we rely on specific suppliers for a number of our critical components and on other contract manufacturers for the manufacture test and assembly of certain products and components we have experienced shortages of components in the past our current reliance on specific or a limited group of suppliers and contract manufacturers involves risks including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components reduced control over pricing and delivery schedules discontinuation of certain components and economic conditions which may adversely impact the viability of our suppliers and contract manufacturers this situation may be exacerbated during any period of economic recovery or a competitive environment any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture assemble and test such components internally could significantly delay our ability to ship our products which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our reputation and brand as well as our operating results 

  

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate which could negatively impact our operations and our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control results in any period could be affected by 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition demand for our products in any quarter or year may vary due to the seasonal buying patterns of our customers in the agricultural and engineering and construction industries the price of our common stock could decline substantially in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors which are based primarily on historical models that are not necessarily accurate representations of the future 

we are dependent on new products and if we are unable to successfully introduce them into the market our customer base may decline or fail to grow as anticipated 

our future revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to bring new products to market on a timely basis we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance of such products we may incur problems in the future in innovating and introducing new products our development stage products may not be successfully completed or if developed may not achieve significant customer acceptance if we were unable to successfully define develop and introduce competitive new products and enhance existing products our future results of operations would be adversely affected development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and we might not achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success if we are unable to introduce new products if other companies develop similar technology products or if we do not develop compelling new products our number of customers may not grow as anticipated or may decline which could harm our operating results 

we are dependent on proprietary technology which could result in litigation that could divert significant valuable resources 

our future success and competitive position is dependent upon our proprietary technology and we rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright law to protect our intellectual property the patents owned or licensed by us may be invalidated circumvented and challenged the rights granted under these patents may not provide competitive advantages to us any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us if at all 

despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain our software or develop software with the same functionality or to obtain and use information 

  

that we regard as proprietary others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology duplicate our technology or design around the patents owned by us in addition effective copyright patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in certain countries the steps taken by us to protect our technology might not prevent the misappropriation of such technology 

the value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many current patent filings we recognize that as new patents are issued or are brought to our attention by the holders of such patents it may be necessary for us to withdraw products from the market take a license from such patent holders or redesign our products we do not believe any of our products currently infringe patents or other proprietary rights of third parties but we cannot be certain they do not do so in addition the legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant expense of operations any such litigation could require us to incur substantial costs and divert significant valuable resources including the efforts of our technical and management personnel which harm our results of operations and financial condition 

our products may contain undetected errors product defects or software errors which could result in damage to our reputation lost revenue diverted development resources and increased service costs warranty claims and litigation 

we warrant that our products will be free of defect for various periods of time depending on the product in addition certain of our contracts include epidemic failure clauses if invoked these clauses may entitle the customer to return or obtain credits for products and inventory or to cancel outstanding purchase orders even if the products themselves are not defective 

we must develop our products quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing market and we have a history of frequently introducing new products products and services as sophisticated as ours could contain undetected errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new models or versions are released in general our products may not be free from errors or defects after commercial shipments have begun which could result in damage to our reputation lost revenue diverted development resources increased customer service and support costs warranty claims and litigation 

many of our products rely on gnss technology the gps and other satellite systems which may become inoperable and result in lost revenue 

gnss technology gps satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage many of the gps satellites currently in orbit were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of 31 satellites in place over a third have already been in operation for more than 14 years to repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites a reduction in the number of operating satellites below the 24satellite standard established for gps may impair the utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities gps satellites and ground control segments are being modernized gps modernization software updates can cause problems we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of gps updates 

as the principal gnss currently in operation we are dependent on continued operation of gps gps is operated by the u s government which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps however if the policy were to change and gps were no longer supported by the u s government or if user fees were imposed it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

many of our products also use signals from systems that augment gps such as the wide area augmentation system and national differential gps system and satellites transmitting signal corrections data on mobile 

  

satellite services frequencies utilized by our omnistar corrections services some of these augmentation systems are operated by the federal government and rely on continued funding and maintenance of these systems in addition some of our products also use satellite signals from the russian glonass system any curtailment of the operating capability of these systems or discontinuance of service could result in decreased user capability thereby impacting our markets 

the european community is developing an independent radio navigation satellite system known as galileo although we have a commercial license to market and sell receivers capable of receiving the galileo open service signal european authorities in the future may decide to offer other premium or encrypted service signals under different licenses even though an operational galileo system is several years away if we are unable to develop a timely commercial product or obtain a timely license to future galileo service signals it could result in lost revenue which could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war terrorism or civil unrest 

acts of war acts of terrorism or other circumstances of civil unrest especially any directed at the gnss signals could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may invoke a redeployment of the satellites used in gnss or interruptions of the system civil unrest or other political activities may impact regional economies through work stoppages and limitations on foreign business transactions to the extent that such interruptions result in delays or cancellations of orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our products are highly technical and some of our software relies on third party technologies including open source software so if integration or incompatibility issues arise with these technologies these technologies become unavailable or our products contain errors defects or security vulnerabilities our product and services development may be delayed our reputation could be harmed and our business could be adversely affected 

our products including our software products are highly technical and complex and when deployed may contain errors defects or security vulnerabilities some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by customers in addition we rely on software that we license from third parties including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions errors viruses or bugs may also be present in software that we license from third parties and incorporate into our products or in third party software that our customers use in conjunction with our software in addition our customers’ proprietary software and network firewall protections may corrupt data from our products and create difficulties in implementing our solutions changes to third party software that our customers use in conjunction with our software could also render our applications inoperable any errors defects or security vulnerabilities in our products or any defects in or compatibility issues with any third party software or customers’ network environments discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition loss of customers and increased service and warranty cost any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products alone or in combination with third party software could expose them to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could harm our reputation and lead some customers to return products to reduce or delay future purchases or use competitive products 

the third party software licenses we rely upon may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all and the software may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors resulting in development delays some of these software licenses are subject to annual renewals at the discretion of the licensors in many cases if we were to breach a provision of these license agreements the 

  

licensor could terminate the agreement immediately we license technologies and patents underlying some of our software from third parties and the loss of these licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such third party software could result in increased costs or delays in software releases or updates until such issues have been resolved this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and future prospects 

we also incorporate open source software into our products although we monitor our use of open source closely the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market or sell our products or to develop new products in such event we could be required to seek licenses from thirdparties in order to continue offering our products to disclose and offer royaltyfree licenses in connection with our own source code to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis any of which could adversely affect our business 

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect an investment in our common stock 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile during fiscal 2011 our stock price ranged from 3188 to 5230 we believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate perhaps substantially including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of “hightech” companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the market price of our common stock may decline 

our information systems or those of our outside vendors may be subject to disruption delays or security incidents that could adversely impact our customers and operations 

we rely on our information systems and those of third parties for things such as processing customer orders delivery of products providing services and support to our customers billing and tracking our customers hosting and managing customer data and otherwise running our business any disruption in our information systems and those of the third parties upon whom we rely could have a significant impact on our business 

a security incident in our own systems or the systems of our third party providers may compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of our own internal data the availability of our products and websites designed to support our customers or our customer data unauthorized access to our proprietary business information or customer data may be obtained through breakins breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party employee theft or misuse breach of the security of the networks of our third party providers 

  

or other misconduct it is also possible that unauthorized access to customer data may be obtained through inadequate use of security controls by customers while our products and services provide and support strong password controls ip restriction and other security mechanisms the use of such mechanisms are controlled in many cases by our customers 

we may also experience delays or interruptions caused by a number of factors including access to the internet the failure of our network or software systems or significant variability in visitor traffic on our product websites it is also possible that hardware or software failures or errors in our systems or in those of our third party providers could result in data loss or corruption or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our customers regard as significant these failures and interruptions could harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers 

although our systems have been designed around industrystandard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes floods fires power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks cyberattacks computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks human error hardware or software defects or malfunctions including defects or malfunctions of components of our systems that are supplied by thirdparty service providers and similar events or disruptions some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities our systems are also subject to breakins sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism despite any precautions we may take the occurrence of a natural disaster a decision by any of our thirdparty hosting providers to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could cause system interruptions and delays and result in loss of critical data and lengthy interruptions in our services 

our global operations expose us to risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally and our results of operations may be adversely affected by our efforts to comply with us laws which apply to international operations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and us export control laws as well as the laws of other countries 

we operate on a global basis with offices or activities in europe africa asia south america australasia and north america we face several risks inherent in conducting business internationally including compliance with international and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations these laws and regulations include data privacy requirements labor relations laws tax laws anticompetition regulations import and trade restrictions export control laws us laws such as the fcpa and export control laws and similar laws in other countries which also prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers many of our products are subject to us export law restrictions that limit the destinations and types of customers to which our products may be sold or require an export license in connection with sales outside the united states given the high level of complexity of these laws there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently breached for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise also we may be held liable for actions taken by our local partners violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees and prohibitions on the conduct of our business any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our operating results 

in addition we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices we may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence or through other methods that us law and regulations prohibit us from using 

  

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties 

in addition to the foregoing engaging in international business inherently involves a number of other difficulties and risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 these factors or any combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue or our overall financial performance

 stock repurchase program 

in january 2008 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to 250 million of our common stock we repurchased approximately 2576000 shares of common stock in open market purchases at an average price of 2867 per share for a total of 738 million in 2010 no shares of common stock were repurchased in 2009 and 2011 the purchase price was reflected as a decrease to common stock based on the average stated value per share with the remainder to retained earnings common stock repurchases under the program were recorded based upon the trade date for accounting purposes all common shares repurchased under this program have been retired in october 2011 our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to 1000 million of our common stock this authorization superseded the 2008 stock repurchase program thus there are no remaining authorized funds under the 2008 stock repurchase program the timing and actual number of future shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price regulatory requirements capital availability and other market conditions the program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without public notice

solutions targeted at the enduser make up a significant majority of our revenue to create compelling products we must attain an understanding of the end users’ needs and work flow and how locationbased technology can enable that end user to work faster more efficiently and more accurately we use this knowledge to create highly innovative products that change the way work is done by the enduser with the exception of our mobile solutions and advanced devices segments our products are generally sold through a dealer channel and it is crucial that we maintain a proficient global thirdparty distribution channel 

we continued to execute our strategy with a series of actions that can be summarized in three categories 

reinforcing our position in existing markets 

we believe these markets continue to be underpenetrated and provide us with additional substantial potential for substituting our technology for traditional methods we are continuing to develop new products and to strengthen our distribution channels in order to expand our market in our engineering and construction segment we demonstrated our leadership in technology innovation by introducing a breakthrough high accuracy global navigation satellite system gnss correction technology with the trimble rtx technology rtx combines realtime data with innovative positioning and compression algorithms to deliver better than 4 centimeter 15 inch repeatable accuracy with as little as one minute convergence in selected areas enabling work to start immediately we introduced our next generation tsc3 handheld controller which provides surveyors with a range of new features and functions from multiple devices into a single handheld a digital camera integrated communications as well as a gnss navigator compass and accelerometer we also released the next generation of trimble ranger 3 rugged handheld computer which meets or exceeds rigorous military standards for temperature extremes drops vibration humidity and altitude we continued to expand our network of sitech technology dealers with the expansion of this dealer network almost complete these dealers represent trimble and caterpillar machine control systems for the contractor’s entire fleet of heavy equipment regardless of machine brand 

in our field solutions segment the agriculture division introduced additional capabilities for the fieldiq crop input control system that allows operators to control the application rate of seed liquid or granular materials 

  

saving costs by preventing seed and fertilizer overlap we also introduced the cfx750 display our newest touch screen display which offers affordable guidance steering and precision agriculture functionality and is compatible with the fieldiq system in the water management sector we introduced ezsurface for farm surface and subsurface drainage applications that will allow farmers and drainage contractors to analyze fields surveyed by viewing 3d models as well as ezsync which will allow farmers and drainage contractors to wirelessly deliver completed drainage designs to the fmx displays via trimble’s connected farm solutions 

in our mobile solutions segment we introduced a new cloudbased field service solution to manage fleet productivity through the trimble geomanager workmanagement—a software solution that provides ondemand visibility into vehicle and mobile worker utilization our acquisition of peoplenet strengthens our strategy for addressing the complex regulatory and operational demands of enterprise companies in the transportation and logistics market peoplenet is a leading provider of integrated onboard computing and mobile communications systems for effective fleet management that help manage regulatory compliance fuel costs driver safety and customer visibility 

in our advanced devices segment to support a growing number of applications demanding highperformance under diverse operating conditions we expanded the functionality of our line of thingmagic embedded rfid readers—mercury6e m6e mercury5e m5e and mercury5ecompact m5ec by releasing a firmware upgrade that optimizes several rfid tag readwrite operations resulting in an overall performance improvement our acquisition of beartooth also expands trimble’s ability to offer unique map content and new outdoorcentric products while simultaneously enhancing current popular applications 

extending our position in new and existing markets through new product categories 

we are utilizing the strength of the trimble brand in our markets to expand our revenue by bringing new products to new and existing users in our engineering and construction segment through our acquisition of sinning vermessungsbedarf gmbh of bavaria germany we introduced the trimble gedo ce trolley system which is a system and software that allows railway track recording and documentation to be completed easily and economically furthermore our acquisition of the assets of omnistar allows us to provide spacebased global navigation satellite system gnss correction services that can improve the accuracy of a gnss receiver for precise positioning applications this acquisition is expected to significantly expand trimble’s worldwide ability to provide landbased correction services for agriculture construction mapping and geographic information system gis and survey applications 

in our field solutions segment through our acquisition of the corridor analyst business from photo science of lexington we introduced the trimble corridor analyst routing software for power transmission lines this software helps select the most appropriate corridors for high voltage power transmission lines furthermore our acquisition of yamei electronics technology co ltd will allow us to expand our solutions for the automotive and related markets in china asia pacific and india yamei manufactures automotive electronics products used for antitheft gps monitoring and tracking rfidbased smart key and start and onboard diagnostics systems 

bringing existing technology to new markets 

 we continue to reinforce our position in existing markets and position ourselves in newer markets that will serve as important sources of future growth in our engineering and construction segment our acquisition of mesta’s software suite allows us to expand our construction applications to the nordic markets we further expanded our network of sitech technology dealers during the quarter by adding new dealerships to serve geographic markets such as italy canada israel taiwan china argentina bolivia chile and uruguay in addition our acquisition of ashtech sas headquartered in carquefou france with offices in beijing china singapore usa and moscow will also help expand trimble’s spectra precision portfolio of survey solutions and allow us to better address emerging markets worldwide 

  

in addition our acquisition of tekla corporation headquartered in espoo finland with offices and operations in 15 countries worldwide will also enhance trimble’s current construction software portfolio by expanding our bim capabilities and enable a compelling set of productivity solutions for contractors around the world 

our efforts also continue to be focused in africa china india the middleeast russia and south america 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements we consider the accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting policies these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

revenue recognition 

we elected to early adopt new revenue accounting guidance related to arrangements with multiple deliverables at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2010 on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or materially modified after fiscal 2009 

we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists shipment has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer or is uncertain revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 

contracts andor customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement shipping documents and customer acceptance when applicable are used to verify delivery we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analyses as well as the customer’s payment history 

revenue for orders is generally not recognized until the product is shipped and title has transferred to the buyer we bear all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods up to that point our shipment terms for us orders and international orders fulfilled from our european distribution center typically provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the carrier named by the buyer at the named place or point if no precise point is indicated by the buyer delivery is deemed to occur when the carrier takes the goods into its charge from the place determined by us other shipment terms may provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the buyer shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 

revenue from sales to distributors and resellers is recognized upon shipment assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met distributors and resellers do not have a right of return 

revenue from purchased extended warranty and post contract support pcs agreements is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the warranty or support period 

we present revenue net of sales taxes and any similar assessments 

our software arrangements generally consist of a perpetual license fee and pcs we generally have established vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for our pcs contracts based on the renewal rate the 

  

remaining value of the software arrangement is allocated to the license fee using the residual method license revenue is primarily recognized when the software has been delivered and fair value has been established for all remaining undelivered elements 

some of our subscription product offerings include hardware subscription services and extended warranty under our hosted arrangements the customer typically does not have the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without incurring a significant penalty and it is not feasible for the customer to run the software either on its own hardware or on a thirdparty’s hardware upfront fees related to our hosted solutions typically consist of amounts for the invehicle enabling hardware device and peripherals 

our multiple deliverable product offerings include hardware with embedded firmware extended warranty and pcs services which are considered separate units of accounting for certain of our products software and nonsoftware components function together to deliver the tangible product’s essential functionality 

in evaluating the revenue recognition for agreements which contain multiple deliverable arrangements under the new accounting guidance we determined that in certain instances we were not able to establish vsoe for some or all deliverables in an arrangement as we infrequently sold each element on a standalone basis did not price products within a narrow range or had a limited sales history when vsoe cannot be established we attempt to establish the selling price of each element based on relevant thirdparty evidence tpe tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately generally our gotomarket strategy differs from that of competitors and offerings may contain a significant level of proprietary technology customization or differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained furthermore we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products’ selling prices are on a standalone basis therefore we typically are not able to establish the selling price of an element based on tpe 

when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe we use our best estimate of selling price besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis besp is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a standalone basis or for new or highly customized offerings we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including but not limited to pricing practices market conditions competitive landscape internal costs geographies and gross margin the determination of besp is made through consultation with and formal approval by our management taking into consideration our gotomarket strategy 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

our accounts receivable balance net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns reserve was 2752 million at the end of fiscal 2011 as compared with 2228 million at the end of fiscal 2010 the allowance for doubtful accounts was 67 million and 34 million at the end of fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively we evaluate ongoing collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors such as age of the accounts receivable balances credit quality historical experience and current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us a specific allowance for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 

inventory valuation 

our inventories net balance were 2321 million at the end of fiscal 2011 as compared with 1929 million at the end of fiscal 2010 our inventory allowances at the end of fiscal 2011 were 376 million as compared with 318 million at the end of fiscal 2010 our inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which 

  

approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or market adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value if required are made for estimated excess or obsolescence balances factors influencing these adjustments include decline in demand technological changes product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues if actual factors are less favorable than those projected by us additional inventory writedowns may be required 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred tax asset or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized 

relative to uncertain tax positions we only recognize the tax benefit if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement our practice is to recognize interest andor penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 

our valuation allowance is primarily attributable to acquired net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize these deferred tax assets and accordingly a valuation allowance has been provided for such amounts valuation allowance adjustments associated with an acquisition after the measurement period are recorded through income tax expense 

goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination intangible assets acquired individually with a group of other assets or in a business combination are recorded at fair value identifiable intangible assets are comprised of distribution channels and distribution rights patents licenses technology acquired backlog trademarks and inprocess research and development identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straightline method reflecting the pattern of economic benefits associated with these assets and have estimated useful lives ranging from one to ten years with a weighted average useful life of 65 years goodwill is not subject to amortization but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment applying a fairvalue based test 

impairment of goodwill intangible assets and other longlived assets 

we evaluate goodwill at a minimum on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing a twostep process first impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit’s carrying amount including goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a discounted cash flow approach if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in step two the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill the difference is recognized as an impairment loss at the end of fiscal 2011 for each reporting unit our estimated fair values exceeded the carry values by substantial margins 

depreciation and amortization of the intangible assets and other longlived assets is provided using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives reflecting the pattern of economic benefits associated with these 

  

assets changes in circumstances such as technological advances changes to our business model or changes in the capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives of intangible assets or other longlived assets differing from initial estimates in those cases where we determine that the useful life of an asset should be revised the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value we will depreciate over its revised remaining useful life these assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable based on their future cash flows the estimated future cash flows are based upon among other things assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows the assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value 

warranty costs 

the liability for product warranties was 184 million at the end of fiscal 2011 as compared with 129 million at the end of fiscal 2010 we accrue for warranty costs as part of cost of sales based on associated material product costs technical support labor costs and costs incurred by third parties performing work on our behalf our expected future cost is primarily estimated based upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment the products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to three years and in some instances up to 55 years 

while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates revisions to the estimated warranty accrual and related costs may be required 

stockbased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to our employees and directors based on estimated fair values the grate date fair value for options is estimated using a binomial valuation model the fair value of rights to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plan is estimated using the blackscholes optionpricing model 

the determination of fair value of sharebased payment awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors riskfree interest rates and expected dividends in addition the binomial model incorporates actual optionpricing behavior and changes in volatility over the option’s contractual term 

we base the expected stock price volatility for stock purchase rights on implied volatilities of traded options on our stock and our expected stock price volatility for stock options is based on a combination of our historical stock price volatility for the period commensurate with the expected life of the stock option and the implied volatility of traded options the use of implied volatilities was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our stock with terms similar to our awards and also upon our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility however because the expected life of our stock options is greater than the terms of our traded options we used a combination of our historical stock price volatility commensurate with the expected life of our stock options and implied volatility of traded options 

we estimated the expected life of the awards based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and postvesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the options and purchase rights the riskfree interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the expected term of the awards 

  

we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future accordingly our expected dividend yield is zero 

because stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income for fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures the stockbased compensation guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 

if factors change and we employ different assumptions to determine the fair value of our sharebased payment awards granted in future periods the compensation expense that we record under it may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period in addition valuation models including the blackscholes and binomial models may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stockbased compensation consequently there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stockbased compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise expiration early termination or forfeiture of those stockbased payments in the future certain stockbased payments such as employee stock options may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements alternatively values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements

results of operations 

overview 

the following table is a summary of revenue gross margin and operating income for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

 

 basis of presentation 

we have a 5253 week fiscal year ending on the friday nearest to december 31 which for fiscal 2011 was december 30 2011 fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 were all 52week years 

revenue 

in fiscal 2011 total revenue increased by 3501 million or 27 to 164 billion from 129 billion in fiscal 2010 the increase in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to stronger performances in the engineering and construction and field solutions segments engineering and construction revenue increased 1874 million or 26 field solutions increased 956 million or 30 mobile solutions increased 643 million or 41 and advanced devices increased 28 million or 3 as compared to fiscal 2010 revenue growth within engineering and construction was driven by strong organic growth due to expanded distribution and improved 

  

end user markets and acquisitions including tekla sales were strong in the us and europe for heavy and highway and survey products additionally field solutions revenue increased primarily due to the increase in demand for agricultural products as relatively high commodity prices led to good farmer income and spending mobile solutions revenue increased primarily due to the peoplenet acquisition and growth within the existing business partially offset by the loss of a large customer in the second quarter of 2010 

in fiscal 2010 total revenue increased by 1677 million or 15 to 129 billion from 113 billion in fiscal 2009 the increase in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to stronger performances in the engineering and construction and field solutions segments engineering and construction revenue increased 1405 million or 24 field solutions increased 264 million or 9 advanced devices increased 14 million or 1 slightly offset by a decrease in mobile solutions of 06 million or less than 1 as compared to fiscal 2009 in fiscal 2010 the revenue growth in engineering and construction reflected a return to growth across the us and rest of the world markets and a strong agricultural environment 

 during fiscal 2011 sales to customers in the united states represented 45 europe represented 24 asia pacific represented 15 and other regions represented 16 of our total revenue during the 2010 fiscal year sales to customers in the united states represented 46 europe represented 22 asia pacific represented 18 and other regions represented 14 of our total revenue during fiscal 2009 sales to customers in the united states represented 50 europe represented 23 asia pacific represented 17 and other regions represented 10 of our total revenue we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue 

 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenue in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 it is possible however that in future periods the failure of one or more large customers to purchase products in quantities anticipated by us may adversely affect the results of operations 

gross margin 

our gross margin varies due to a number of factors including product mix pricing distribution channel used effects of production volumes new product startup costs and foreign currency translations 

in fiscal 2011 our gross margin increased by 1841 million as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to higher revenue gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 505 in fiscal 2011 and 499 in fiscal 2010 the increase in gross margin percentage was primarily due to an increase in sales of higher margin products primarily software and subscription revenue which were partially offset by higher amortization of purchased intangibles 

in fiscal 2010 our gross margin increased by 956 million as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to higher revenue gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 499 in fiscal 2010 and 488 in fiscal 2009 the increase in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to improved product mix in engineering and construction and field solutions partially offset by the loss of a large high margin customer in mobile solutions 

 because of potential product mix changes within and among the industry markets market pressures on unit selling prices fluctuations in unit manufacturing costs including increases in component prices and other factors current level gross margin cannot be assured 

operating income 

operating income increased by 288 million for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 operating income as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2011 was 95 as compared to 99 for fiscal 2010 the increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher revenue and associated gross margin the decrease in operating income percentage was primarily due to higher amortization of purchased intangibles due to acquisitions 

  

operating income increased by 418 million for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 operating income as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2010 was 99 as compared to 76 for fiscal 2009 the increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher revenue and associated gross margin the increase in operating income percentage was primarily due to improved operating expense leverage primarily in engineering and construction and due to higher revenue 

results by segment 

to achieve distribution marketing production and technology advantages in our targeted markets we manage our operations in the following four segments engineering and construction field solutions mobile solutions and advanced devices operating income equals net revenue less cost of sales and operating expense excluding general corporate expense amortization of purchased intangible assets amortization of inventory stepup acquisition costs and restructuring charges 

the following table is a breakdown of revenue and operating income by segment for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

 

   

a reconciliation of our consolidated segment operating income to consolidated income before income taxes follows 

 

 unallocated corporate expense includes general corporate expense amortization of inventory stepup and restructuring cost 

engineering and construction 

engineering and construction revenue increased by 1874 million or 26 while segment operating income increased by 381 million or 343 for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 the revenue growth was primarily driven by strong organic growth due to expanded distribution and improved end user markets and acquisitions including tekla sales were strong in the us and europe for heavy and highway and survey products although residential and commercial construction was flat in the us and most parts of europe and china sales slowed products sales associated with infrastructure build out were strong operating income increased primarily due to higher revenue higher gross margin and increased operating leverage 

engineering and construction revenue increased by 1405 million or 24 while segment operating income increased by 527 million or 904 for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 the revenue increase reflected a return to growth across the us and rest of the world markets for survey construction and geospatial product lines although residential and commercial construction in the united states and europe did not significantly contribute to the growth in fiscal 2010 construction product sales associated with the building of highway infrastructure were robust operating income increased primarily due to higher revenue and increased operating leverage 

field solutions 

field solutions revenue increased by 956 million or 30 while segment operating income increased by 438 million or 376 for fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 the revenue growth was primarily due to higher sales across the world for our agricultural products as relatively high commodity prices increased farmer income and spending sales for agricultural products were robust across the americas europe and asia pacific regions additionally gis contributed to strong field solutions revenue due to the new product introductions and the tekla acquisition from which we gained an infrastructure and energy business that falls under field solutions also contributed operating income increased primarily due to higher revenue higher gross margin and increased operating leverage 

field solutions revenue increased by 264 million or 9 while segment operating income increased by 119 million or 114 for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 the increase in revenue was driven primarily by increased farmer demand for agricultural products generally corn and soybean commodity prices were higher in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 resulting in a robust farm economy and increased spending by farmers for our agriculture productivity products operating income increased primarily due to higher revenue in our agricultural business 

  

mobile solutions 

mobile solutions revenue increased by 643 million or 41 while segment operating income increased by 26 million or 1382 for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 the revenue increase was primarily due to acquisitions including peoplenet and growth within the existing business partially offset by a loss of a large customer in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 operating income increased primarily due to the peoplenet acquisition and organic growth 

mobile solutions revenue decreased by 06 million or less than 1 while segment operating income decreased by 125 million or 869 for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 revenue was slightly down primarily due to the loss of a large customer in the second quarter of 2010 partially offset by revenue from acquisitions operating income declined primarily due to the loss of a large high margin customer and higher operating expense associated with acquisitions not applicable with the prior year 

advanced devices 

advanced devices revenue increased by 28 million or 3 and segment operating income decreased by 44 million or 242 for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 the increase in revenue was driven by new product introductions within applanix and acquisition revenue partially offset by a reduction in demand for gpsbased timing and synchronization devices the decrease in operating income was primarily driven by product mix and acquisitions 

advanced devices revenue increased by 14 million or 1 and segment operating income increased by 11 million or 64 for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 the increase in revenue reflected a return to growth in both our component and gnss position and orientation systems operating income increased primarily due to the increase in revenue as well as gross margin percentage increases due to product mix 

research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 

the following table shows research and development “rd” sales and marketing and general and administrative “ga” expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions of those operating expenses below 

 

 overall rd sales and marketing and ga expenses increased by approximately 1386 million in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

research and development expense increased by 469 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 substantially all of our rd costs have been expensed as incurred overall research and development spending was approximately 12 of revenue in fiscal 2011 and 11 in fiscal 2010 the increase in rd expense in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to the inclusion of expense of 278 million from acquisitions not applicable in fiscal 2010 a 80 million increase in engineering costs associated with new product rollouts a 49 million increase in compensation related expense a 36 million increase due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and a 26 million increase in other expenses 

  

research and development expense increased by 135 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 overall research and development spending was approximately 11 of revenue in fiscal 2010 and 12 in fiscal 2009 the increase in rd expense in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the inclusion of expense of 45 million from acquisitions not applicable in fiscal 2009 a 39 million increase in engineering costs associated with new product rollouts a 20 million increase in compensation related expense a 15 million increase due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and a 16 million increase in other expenses 

 we believe that the development and introduction of new products are critical to our future success and we expect to continue active development of new products 

sales and marketing expense increased by 517 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 spending overall was approximately 16 of revenue in fiscal 2011 compared to 17 in fiscal 2010 the increase in sales and marketing expense in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to the inclusion of expense of 359 million from acquisitions not applicable in fiscal 2010 a 120 million increase in compensation related expense a 45 million increase due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates partially offset by a 07 million decrease in other expenses 

sales and marketing expense increased by 253 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 spending overall remained relatively constant at approximately 17 of revenue in both fiscal 2010 and 2009 the increase in sales and marketing expense in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the inclusion of expense of 126 million from acquisitions not applicable in fiscal 2009 a 91 million increase in compensation related expense a 29 million increase in travel expense a 09 million increase due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates 

 our future growth will depend in part on the timely development and continued viability of the markets in which we currently compete as well as our ability to continue to identify and develop new markets for our products 

general and administrative expense increased by 400 million in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 spending overall was at approximately 10 of revenue in fiscal 2011 compared to 9 in fiscal 2010 the increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to the inclusion of expense of 193 million from acquisitions not applicable in fiscal 2010 an 84 million increase in nonrecurring acquisition related costs a 40 million increase in tax legal and consulting expense a 19 million increase in compensation related expense a 15 million increase due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates a 13 million increase in travel expense and a 35 million increase in other expenses 

general and administrative expense increased by 175 million in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 spending overall remained relatively constant at approximately 9 of revenue in both fiscal 2010 and 2009 the increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the inclusion of expense of 102 million from acquisitions not applicable in fiscal 2009 a 106 million increase in compensation related expense a 05 million increase due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates a 04 million increase in travel expense which was partially offset by a 16 million decrease in bad debt expense and a 26 million decrease in other expenses

total amortization expense of purchased and other intangible assets was 852 million in fiscal 2011 of which 365 million was recorded in cost of sales and 487 million was recorded in operating expenses total amortization expense of purchased and other intangibles represented 52 of revenue in fiscal 2011 an increase of 275 million from fiscal 2010 when it represented 45 of revenue the increase was primarily due to the tekla and peoplenet acquisitions and to a lesser extent other acquisitions made in fiscal 2011 as well as fiscal 2010 acquisition intangibles that included a full year impact of amortization expense in fiscal 2011 

total amortization expense of purchased and other intangible assets was 576 million in fiscal 2010 of which 249 million was recorded in cost of sales and 327 million was recorded in operating expenses total amortization expense of purchased and other intangibles represented 45 of revenue in fiscal 2010 an increase of 50 million from fiscal 2009 when it represented 47 of revenue the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of certain technology and patent intangibles as a result of acquisitions made in fiscal 2010 as well as fiscal 2009 acquisition intangibles that included a full year impact of amortization expense in fiscal 2010 

nonoperating income net 

the following table shows nonoperating income net for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

 

 total nonoperating income net decreased by 24 million during fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 the decrease was primarily due to an increase in interest expense due to an increase in debt associated with acquisitions and a reduction in deferred compensation plan asset gains and losses included in other income net offset by the impact of foreign currency transaction gain loss primarily related to foreign exchange hedges associated with two of our larger acquisitions and the impact of higher income from equity method investments 

total nonoperating income net increased by 117 million during fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 the increase was due to higher income from joint ventures and changes in our deferred compensation gains losses included in other income net partially offset by a change in foreign exchange gains losses 

income tax provision 

our effective income tax rate for fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 was 11 27 and 27 respectively the 2011 and 2009 rates were less than the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the geographical mix of our pretax income and to a lesser extent research and development tax credits and a settlement with the us tax authorities the 2010 rate was less than the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the geographical mix of our pretax income and valuation allowance release offset by the net impact of the us internal revenue service irs 2005 through 2007 audit settlement in 2010 

litigation matters 

 from time to time we are involved in litigation arising out of the ordinary course of our business there are no known claims or pending litigation that are expected to have a material effect on our overall financial position results of operations or liquidity 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than lease commitments incurred in the normal course of business see contractual obligations table below we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities guarantee contracts retained or contingent interests in transferred assets or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity we do not have any majorityowned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements additionally we do not have any interest in or relationship with any special purpose entities 

in the normal course of business to facilitate sales of its products we indemnify other parties including customers lessors and parties to other transactions with us with respect to certain matters we have agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties these agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents 

it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under these agreements were not material and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on the consolidated balance sheets at the end of fiscal 2011 and 2010 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 cash and cash equivalents 

at the end of fiscal 2011 cash and cash equivalents totaled 1546 million compared to 2208 million at the end of fiscal 2010 we had debt of 5644 million at the end of fiscal 2011 compared to 1532 million at the end of fiscal 2010 

 our ability to continue to generate cash from operations will depend in large part on profitability the rate of collections of accounts receivable our inventory turns and our ability to manage other areas of working capital 

 we believe that our cash and cash equivalents together with our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs debt service planned capital expenditures and stock purchases under the stock repurchase program for at least the next twelve months 

  

 we anticipate that planned capital expenditures primarily for the building of a facility in westminster colorado expected to begin in 2012 as well as computer equipment software manufacturing tools and test equipment and leasehold improvements associated with business expansion will constitute a partial use of our cash resources decisions related to how much cash is used for investing are influenced by the expected amount of cash to be provided by operations 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 2416 million for fiscal 2011 as compared to 1240 million for fiscal 2010 the increase of 1176 million was due to an increase in net income before noncash depreciation and amortization primarily attributable to engineering and construction and field solutions segments’ increased revenue offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to higher revenue from engineering and construction and field solutions segments additionally fiscal 2010 included the payment of income taxes payable associated with the irs tax settlement which is not applicable in fiscal 2011 

cash provided by operating activities was 1240 million for fiscal 2010 as compared to 1946 million for fiscal 2009 the decrease of 706 million was driven by an increase in inventory spending a 497 million payment associated with an irs settlement partially offset by an increase in net income before noncash depreciation and amortization accounts payable and accrued compensation and benefits the increase in inventories during fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to our engineering and construction segment and was due to an increase in revenue 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 7736 million for fiscal 2011 as compared to 1564 million for fiscal 2010 the increase of 6172 million was primarily due to higher cash used for business and intangible asset acquisitions in fiscal 2011 with the largest cash requirement due to the tekla acquisition 

cash used in investing activities was 1564 million for fiscal 2010 as compared to 839 million for fiscal 2009 the increase of 724 million was primarily due to higher cash used for business and intangible asset acquisitions in fiscal 2010 

financing activities 

cash provided by financing activities was 4642 million for fiscal 2011 as compared to cash used of 202 million during fiscal 2010 the increase of 4843 million was primarily due to proceeds from longterm debt and revolving credit lines for business acquisitions an increase in proceeds received from the issuance of common stock related to stock option exercises the repurchase of common stock during fiscal 2010 offset by payments on longterm debt and debt issuance costs during fiscal 2011 

cash used by financing activities was 202 million for fiscal 2010 as compared to cash provided of 161 million during fiscal 2009 the decrease of 363 million was primarily due to the stock repurchases in the first nine months of fiscal 2010 partially offset by common stock issued upon the exercise of stock options 

accounts receivable and inventory metrics 

 

 accounts receivable days sales outstanding were down at 58 days at the end of fiscal 2011 as compared to 63 days at the end of fiscal 2010 our accounts receivable days sales outstanding are calculated based on ending 

  

accounts receivable net divided by revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter times a quarterly average of 91 days our inventory turns were both 38 at the end of fiscal 2011 and 2010 our inventory turnover is based on the total cost of sales for the fiscal period over the average inventory for the corresponding fiscal period 

repatriation of foreign earnings and income taxes 

a significant portion of our foreign earnings continue to be permanently reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries and it is anticipated this reinvestment will not impede cash needs at the parent company level in our determination of which foreign earnings are permanently reinvested we consider numerous factors including the financial requirements of the us parent company the financial requirements of the foreign subsidiaries and the tax consequences of remitting the foreign earnings back to the us there are no other material impediments to our ability to access sources of liquidity and our resulting ability to meet short and longterm liquidity needs other than in the event we are not in compliance with the covenants under our 2011 credit facility or the tax costs of remitting foreign earnings back to the us 

debt 

on may 6 2011 we entered into a new credit agreement or 2011 credit facility with a group of lenders this credit facility provides for unsecured credit facilities in the aggregate principal amount of 11 billion comprised of a fiveyear revolving loan facility of 7000 million and a fiveyear 4000 million term loan facility subject to the terms of the 2011 credit facility the revolving loan facility and the term loan facility may be increased by up to 3000 million in the aggregate but we may no longer draw down on the term loan facility additionally on july 14 2011 we entered into a 50 million uncommitted revolving loan facility which we call our 2011 uncommitted facility this facility is callable by the bank at any time and has no covenants the interest rate on the 2011 uncommitted facility is 100 plus either libor or the bank’s cost of funds or as otherwise agreed upon by the bank and us 

at the end of fiscal 2011 our total debt was comprised primarily of a term loan of 3850 million and a revolving credit line of 1333 million under the 2011 credit facility and a revolving credit line of 440 million under the 2011 uncommitted facility of the total outstanding balance 3650 million of the term loan and 1333 million of the revolving credit line are classified as longterm in the consolidated balance sheet at the end of fiscal 2011 we had promissory notes and other notes payable totaling approximately 21 million consisted primarily of notes payable of 17 million to noncontrolling interest holders of one of our consolidated subsidiaries the notes bear interest at 6 and have undefined payment terms but are callable with a six month notification for additional discussion of our debt see note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

the funds available under the 2011 credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes the financing of acquisitions and the payment of transaction fees and expenses related to such acquisitions under the 2011 credit facility we may borrow repay and reborrow funds under the revolving loan facility until its maturity on may 6 2016 at which time the revolving facility will terminate and all outstanding loans together with all accrued and unpaid interest must be repaid amounts not borrowed under the revolving facility will be subject to a commitment fee to be paid in arrears on the last day of each fiscal quarter ranging from 020 to 040 per annum depending on our leverage ratio as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter the term loan will be repaid in quarterly installments with the last quarterly payment to be made at april 1 2016 on an annualized basis the amortization of the term loan is as follows 5 5 10 10 and 70 for years one through five respectively the term loan may be prepaid in whole or in part subject to certain minimum thresholds without penalty or premium amounts repaid or prepaid with respect to the term loan facility may not be reborrowed 

we may borrow funds under the 2011 credit facility in us dollars euros or in certain other agreed currencies and borrowings will bear interest at our option at either i a floating per annum base rate based on the administrative agent’s prime rate or other agreedupon rate depending on the currency borrowed plus a margin of between 025 and 125 depending on our leverage ratio as of the most recently ended fiscal 

  

quarter or ii a reserveadjusted fixed per annum rate based on libor euribor stibor or other agreedupon rate depending on the currency borrowed plus a margin of between 125 and 225 depending on our leverage ratio as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter interest will be paid on the last day of each fiscal quarter with respect to borrowings bearing interest based on a floating rate or on the last day of an interest period but at least every three months with respect to borrowings bearing interest at a fixed rate our obligations under the 2011 credit facility are guaranteed by several of our domestic subsidiaries 

the 2011 credit facility contains various customary representations and warranties by us the 2011 credit facility also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including among other requirements negative covenants that restrict our ability to dispose of assets create liens incur indebtedness repurchase stock pay dividends make acquisitions and make investments further the 2011 credit facility contains financial covenants that require the maintenance of minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios specifically we must maintain as of the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of a ebitda as defined in the 2011 credit facility to b interest expenses for the most recently ended period of four fiscal quarters of not less than 35 to 1 we must also maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of x total indebtedness to y ebitda as defined in the 2011 credit facility for the most recently ended period of four fiscal quarters of not greater than the applicable ratio set forth in the table below provided that on the completion of a material acquisition we may increase the applicable ratio in the table below by 025 for the fiscal quarter during which such acquisition occurred and each of the three subsequent fiscal quarters 

 

 we were in compliance with these restrictive covenants at the end of fiscal 2011 

the 2011 credit facility contains events of default that include among others nonpayment of principal interest or fees breach of covenants inaccuracy of representations and warranties cross defaults to certain other indebtedness bankruptcy and insolvency events material judgments and events constituting a change of control upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default interest on the obligations will accrue at an increased rate and the lenders may accelerate our obligations under the 2011 credit facility however that acceleration will be automatic in the case of bankruptcy and insolvency events of default 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at the end of fiscal 2011 

 

  

   

  at the end of fiscal 2011 we had unrecognized tax benefits included in other noncurrent liabilities of 157 million including interest and penalties at this time we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with tax authorities regarding this liability and therefore such amounts are not included in the contractual obligations table above 

effect of new accounting pronouncements 

the impact of recent accounting pronouncements is disclosed in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

reconciliation of gaap to nongaap financial measures 

our nongaap measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap measures the nongaap financial measures included in the following table are set forth below 

nongaap gross margin 

we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap gross margin as a way of understanding how product mix pricing decisions and manufacturing costs influence our business nongaap gross margin excludes restructuring costs amortization of purchased intangibles stockbased compensation and amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup from gaap gross margin we believe that these exclusions offer investors additional information that may be useful to view trends in our gross margin performance 

nongaap operating expenses 

we believe this measure is important to investors evaluating our nongaap spending in relation to revenue nongaap operating expenses exclude restructuring costs amortization of purchased intangibles stockbased compensation and acquisition costs associated with external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition activities such as legal due diligence and integration costs from gaap operating expenses we believe that these exclusions offer investors supplemental information to facilitate comparison of our operating expenses to our prior results 

nongaap operating income 

we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap operating income trends which are driven by revenue gross margin and spending nongaap operating income excludes restructuring costs amortization of purchased intangibles stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup and acquisition costs associated with external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition activities such as legal due diligence and integration costs we believe that these exclusions offer an alternative means for our investors to evaluate current operating performance compared to results of other periods 

nongaap nonoperating income net 

we believe this measure helps investors evaluate our nonoperating income trends nongaap nonoperating income net excludes acquisition gains or costs associated with unusual acquisition related items such as a gain 

  

on bargain purchase resulting from the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired exceeding the consideration transferred adjustments to the fair value of earnout liabilities and payments made or received to settle earnout and holdback disputes these costs are specific to particular acquisitions and vary significantly in amount and timing nongaap nonoperating income net also excludes the writeoff of debt issuance costs associated with a terminated credit facility as well as a foreign exchange gain specifically associated with two of our larger acquisitions we believe that these exclusions provide investors with a supplemental view of our ongoing financial results 

nongaap income tax provision 

investors benefit from the exclusion of an irs settlement because it facilitates comparisons to our past income tax provision nongaap income tax provision excludes an irs settlement and a valuation allowance release from gaap income tax provision and includes nongaap items tax effected nongaap items tax effected adjusts the provision for income taxes to reflect the effect of certain nongaap items on nongaap net income we believe this information is useful to investors because it provides for consistent treatment of the excluded items in our nongaap presentation 

nongaap net income 

this measure provides a supplemental view of net income trends which are driven by nongaap income before taxes and our nongaap tax rate nongaap net income excludes restructuring costs amortization of purchased intangibles stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisition costs the writeoff of debt issuance costs a foreign exchange gain associated with two of our larger acquisitions and nongaap tax adjustments from gaap net income we believe our investors benefit from understanding these exclusions and from an alternative view of our net income performance as compared to our past net income performance 

nongaap diluted net income per share 

we believe our investors benefit by understanding our nongaap operating performance as reflected in a per share calculation as a way of measuring nongaap operating performance by ownership in the company nongaap diluted net income per share excludes restructuring costs amortization of purchased intangibles stockbased compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisition costs the writeoff of debt issuance costs a foreign exchange gain associated with two acquisitions and nongaap tax adjustments from gaap diluted net income per share we believe that these exclusions offer investors a useful view of our diluted net income per share as compared to our past diluted net income per share 

nongaap operating leverage 

we believe this information is beneficial to investors as a measure of how much incremental revenue is contributed to our operating income nongaap operating leverage is the increase in nongaap operating income as a percentage of the increase in revenue we believe that this information offers investors supplemental information to evaluate our current performance and to compare to our past nongaap operating leverage 

nongaap segment operating income 

nongaap segment operating income excludes stockbased compensation from gaap segment operating income we believe this information is useful to investors because some may exclude stockbased compensation as an alternative view when assessing trends in the operating income of our segments 

  

these nongaap measures can be used to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance as well as our performance relative to competitors we believe some of our investors track our “core operating performance” as a means of evaluating our performance in the ordinary ongoing and customary course of our operations core operating performance excludes items that are noncash not expected to recur or not reflective of ongoing financial results management also believes that looking at our core operating performance provides a supplemental way to provide consistency in period to period comparisons accordingly management excludes from nongaap those items relating to restructuring amortization of purchased intangibles stock based compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup acquisition costs the writeoff of debt issuance costs a foreign exchange gain associated with two acquisitions and certain tax chargesbenefits of which 275 million is associated with the irs settlement and 76 million is associated with valuation allowance release benefit for detailed explanations of the adjustments made to comparable gaap measures see items a – l below 

  

 

   

 

  

    

  

  

           

nongaap operating income 

nongaap operating income increased by 745 million for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 and increased by 456 million for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 nongaap operating income as a percentage of total revenue was 178 168 and 153 for fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

the increase in operating income and operating income percentage during fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily driven by higher revenue and associated operating leverage in engineering and construction and field solutions the increase in operating income and operating income percentage during fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily driven by higher revenue and associated operating leverage in engineering and construction and field solutions partially offset by mobile solutions

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors 

market interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds treasury bills interest and noninterest bearing bank deposits as well as bank time deposits the main objective of these instruments is safety of principal and liquidity while maximizing return without significantly increasing risk 

 due to the shortterm nature of our cash equivalents we do not anticipate any material effect on our portfolio due to fluctuations in interest rates 

we are exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing interest rates under our credit facilities our 2011 credit facility is comprised of an unsecured term loan and a revolving credit agreement with maturity dates of may 2016 and also an unsecured uncommitted revolving credit agreement that is callable by the bank at any time we may borrow funds these facilities in us dollars or in certain other currencies and borrowings will bear interest as described under note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

at the end of fiscal 2011 our total debt was comprised primarily of a term loan of 3850 million and a revolving credit line of 1333 million under the 2011 credit facility and a revolving credit line of 440 million under the 2011 uncommitted facility a hypothetical 10 increase in the onemonth libor rates could result in approximately 167000 annual increase in interest expense on the existing principal balances 

 the hypothetical changes and assumptions made above will be different from what actually occurs in the future furthermore the computations do not anticipate actions that may be taken by our management should the hypothetical market changes actually occur over time as a result actual earnings effects in the future will differ from those quantified above 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we operate in international markets which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and various foreign currencies the most significant of which is the euro 

historically the majority of our revenue contracts are denominated in us dollars with the most significant exception being europe where we invoice primarily in euros additionally a portion of our operating expenses primarily the cost to manufacture cost of personnel to deliver technical support on our products and professional 

  

services sales and sales support and research and development are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the euro swedish krona new zealand dollar and canadian dollar revenue resulting from selling in local currencies and costs incurred in local currencies are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations which can affect our operating income as exchange rates vary operating income may differ from expectations in fiscal 2011 and 2010 the impact to operating income was immaterial 

we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on cash certain trade and intercompany receivables and payables primarily denominated in australian canadian and new zealand dollars japanese yen indian rupee south african rand swedish krona euro and british pound these contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements as the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses on the forward contracts these instruments are marked to market through earnings every period and generally range from one to three months in original maturity we do not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for trading purposes we occasionally enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the purchase price of some of our larger business acquisitions foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at the end of fiscal 2011 and 2010 are summarized as follows in thousands 

 

  we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position utilizing our current hedging strategy

 item 1 business tableend trimble navigation limited a california corporation “trimble” or “the company” or “we” or “our” or “us” provides advanced positioning product solutions typically to commercial and government users the principal application areas include surveying agriculture construction asset management mapping and mobile resource management our products provide benefits that can include lower operational costs higher productivity improved quality and compliance product examples include agricultural and construction equipment guidance systems surveying instruments systems that track fleets of vehicles data collection systems that enable the management of large amounts of georeferenced information and information asset management systems for construction and agricultural markets in addition we also manufacture components for invehicle navigation and telematics systems and timing modules used in the synchronization of wireless networks 

our products often combine knowledge of location or position with a wireless link to provide a solution for a specific application position is provided through a number of technologies including the global positioning system or gps other global navigation satellite systems or gnss and their augmentation systems and systems that use laser or optical technologies to establish position wireless communication techniques include both public networks such as cellular and private networks such as business band radio some of our products are augmented by our software this includes embedded firmware that enables the positioning solution and application software that allows the customer to make use of the positioning information we complement our product offerings with other software that the customer may elect to purchase as an enhancement to the solution these solutions are delivered as either licensed software or in a hosted environment using software as a service or saas model 

we design and market our own products our manufacturing strategy includes a combination of inhouse assembly and third party subcontractors our global operations include major development manufacturing or logistics operations in the united states sweden germany new zealand canada the united kingdom the netherlands china and india products are sold through dealers representatives joint ventures and other channels throughout the world these channels are supported by our sales offices located in 25 countries 

we began operations in 1978 and incorporated in california in 1981 our common stock has been publicly traded on nasdaq since 1990 under the symbol trmb 

technology overview 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from applying global navigation satellite system or gnss technology to terrestrial applications the gnss includes the network of 24 orbiting us global positioning system or gps radio navigation satellites and associated ground control that is funded and maintained by the us government and is available worldwide free of direct user fees and the russian glonass radio navigation satellite system both the european community and china have announced plans to establish future operational radio navigation satellite systems gnss positioning is based on a technique that precisely measures distances from four or more satellites the satellites continuously transmit precisely timed radio signals using extremely accurate atomic clocks a gnss receiver measures distances from the satellites in view by determining the travel time of a signal from the satellite to the receiver and then uses those distances to compute its position under normal circumstances a standalone gnss receiver is able to calculate its position at any point on earth in the earth’s atmosphere or in lower earth orbit to approximately 10 meters 24 hours a day much better accuracies are possible through a technique called “differential gnss” in addition to providing position gnss provides extremely accurate time measurement 

gnss accuracy is dependent upon the locations of the receiver and the number of gnss satellites that are above the horizon at any given time reception of gnss signals requires lineofsight visibility between the satellites and the receiver which can be blocked by buildings hills and dense foliage the receiver must have a line of sight to at least four satellites to determine its latitude longitude and time the accuracy of gnss may also be limited by distortion of gnss signals from ionospheric and other atmospheric conditions 

our gnss products are based on proprietary receiver technology over time the advances in positioning wireless communications and information technologies have enabled us to add more capability to our products and thereby deliver more value to our users gps is being modernized and glonass modernization is planned for example the developments in wireless technology and deployments of next generation wireless 

  

networks have enabled less expensive wireless communications these developments provide the efficient transfer of position data to locations away from the positioning field device allowing the data to be accessed by more users thereby increasing productivity this allows us to integrate visualization and design software into some of our systems as well as offer positioning services all of which make our customers more efficient at what they do 

our laser and optical products either measure distances and angles to provide a position in three dimensional space or are used as highly accurate laser references from which a position can be established the key elements of these products are typically a laser which is generally a commercially available laser diode and a complex mechanical assembly these elements are augmented by software algorithms to provide measurements and applicationspecific solutions

 item 1a risk factors tableend risks and uncertainties 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k and in any other documents to which we refer you in this form 10k before purchasing our securities the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 

  

our inability to accurately predict orders and shipments may subject our results of operations to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter 

we have not been able in the past to consistently predict when our customers will place orders and request shipments so that we cannot always accurately plan our manufacturing requirements as a result if orders and shipments differ from what we predict we may incur additional expense and build excess inventory which may require additional reserves and allowances accordingly we have limited visibility into future changes in demand and our results of operations may be subject to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter 

our operating results in each quarter may be affected by special conditions such as seasonality late quarter purchases weather economic conditions and other potential issues 

due in part to the buying patterns of our customers a significant portion of our quarterly revenue occurs from orders received and immediately shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of each quarter although our operating expense tends to remain fairly predictable engineering and construction purchases tend to occur in early spring and governmental agencies tend to utilize funds available at the end of the government’s fiscal year for additional purchases at the end of our third fiscal quarter in september of each year concentrations of orders sometimes also occur at the end of our other two fiscal quarters additionally a majority of our sales force earns commissions on a quarterly basis which may cause concentrations of orders at the end of any fiscal quarter it could harm our operating results if for any reason expected sales are deferred orders are not received or shipments are delayed a few days at the end of a quarter 

in addition our operations and performance depend on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of business spending in the recent past uncertainties in the financial and credit markets have caused our customers to postpone purchases and negative economic conditions may reduce future sales of or demand for our products and services in addition negative economic conditions may depress the tax revenues of federal state and local government entities which are significant purchasers of our products with the exception primarily of our mobile solutions and advanced devices segments our products are generally sold through a dealer channel and our dealers depend on the availability of credit to finance purchases of our products for their inventory 

customer collections are our primary source of cash while we believe we have a strong customer base and have experienced strong collections in the past negative economic conditions may result in increased collection times or greater writeoffs which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow any writeoff of goodwill could also negatively impact our financial results these and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and operating results 

we are dependent on a specific manufacturer and assembler for many of our products and on other manufacturers and specific suppliers of critical parts for our products 

we are substantially dependent upon flextronics international limited as our preferred manufacturing partner for many of our gps products under the agreement we provide to flextronics a twelvemonth product forecast and place purchase orders with flextronics at least thirty calendar days in advance of the scheduled delivery of products to our customers depending on production lead time although purchase orders placed with flextronics are cancelable the terms of the agreement would require us to purchase from flextronics all inventory not returnable or usable by other flextronics customers accordingly if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products we may be unable to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity from flextronics to meet customers’ delivery requirements or we may accumulate excess inventories if such inventories are not usable by other flextronics customers our current contract with flextronics continues in effect until either party gives the other ninety days written notice  

we rely on specific suppliers for a number of our critical components and on other contract manufacturers for the manufacture test and assembly of certain products and components we have experienced shortages of components in the past our current reliance on specific or a limited group of suppliers and contract manufacturers involves risks including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components reduced control over pricing and delivery schedules discontinuation of certain components and economic conditions which may adversely impact the viability of our suppliers and contract manufacturers this situation may be exacerbated during any period of economic recovery or a competitive environment any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture assemble and test such components internally could significantly delay our ability to ship our products which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our reputation and brand as well as our operating results 

  

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate which could negatively impact our operations and our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control results in any period could be affected by 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition demand for our products in any quarter or year may vary due to the seasonal buying patterns of our customers in the agricultural and engineering and construction industries the price of our common stock could decline substantially in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors which are based primarily on historical models that are not necessarily accurate representations of the future 

we are dependent on new products and if we are unable to successfully introduce them into the market our customer base may decline or fail to grow as anticipated 

our future revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to bring new products to market on a timely basis we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance of such products we may incur problems in the future in innovating and introducing new products our development stage products may not be successfully completed or if developed may not achieve significant customer acceptance if we were unable to successfully define develop and introduce competitive new products and enhance existing products our future results of operations would be adversely affected development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and we might not achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success if we are unable to introduce new products if other companies develop similar technology products or if we do not develop compelling new products our number of customers may not grow as anticipated or may decline which could harm our operating results 

we are dependent on proprietary technology which could result in litigation that could divert significant valuable resources 

our future success and competitive position is dependent upon our proprietary technology and we rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright law to protect our intellectual property the patents owned or licensed by us may be invalidated circumvented and challenged the rights granted under these patents may not provide competitive advantages to us any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us if at all 

despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain our software or develop software with the same functionality or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology duplicate our technology or design around the patents owned by us in addition effective copyright patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in certain countries the steps taken by us to protect our technology might not prevent the misappropriation of such technology 

the value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many current patent filings we recognize that as new patents are issued or are brought to our attention by the holders of such patents it may be necessary for us to withdraw products from the market take a license from such patent holders or redesign our products we do not believe any of our products currently infringe patents or other proprietary rights of third parties but we cannot be certain they do not do so in addition the legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant expense of operations any such litigation could require us to incur substantial costs and divert 

  

significant valuable resources including the efforts of our technical and management personnel which harm our results of operations and financial condition 

investing in and integrating new acquisitions could be costly and may place a significant strain on our management systems and resources which could negatively impact our operating results 

we have recently acquired a number of companies and intend to continue to acquire other companies acquisitions of companies entail numerous risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of such acquisitions we have significant assets that include goodwill and other purchased intangibles the testing of this goodwill and intangibles for impairment under established accounting guidelines requires significant use of judgment and assumptions changes in business conditions could require adjustments to the valuation of these assets in addition losses incurred by a company in which we have an investment may have a direct impact on our financial statements or could result in our having to writedown the value of such investment any such problems in integration or adjustments to the value of the assets acquired could harm our growth strategy and could be costly and place a significant strain on our management systems and resources 

our products may contain undetected errors product defects or software errors which could result in damage to our reputation lost revenue diverted development resources and increased service costs warranty claims and litigation 

we warrant that our products will be free of defect for various periods of time depending on the product in addition certain of our contracts include epidemic failure clauses if invoked these clauses may entitle the customer to return or obtain credits for products and inventory or to cancel outstanding purchase orders even if the products themselves are not defective 

we must develop our products quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing market and we have a history of frequently introducing new products products and services as sophisticated as ours could contain undetected errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new models or versions are released in general our products may not be free from errors or defects after commercial shipments have begun which could result in damage to our reputation lost revenue diverted development resources increased customer service and support costs warranty claims and litigation 

we are dependent on the availability of allocated bands within the radio frequency spectrum 

our gnss technology is dependent on the use of satellite signals from space and on terrestrial communication bands international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union itu a specialized technical agency of the united nations these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used in the united states the federal communications commission fcc and the national telecommunications and information administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations 

any itu or local reallocation of radio frequency bands including frequency band segmentation and sharing of spectrum or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our customers for example the fcc is currently considering a proposal by a private party lightsquared to repurpose spectrum adjacent to the gps bands for terrestrial broadband wireless operations in metropolitan 

  

areas throughout the united states if the fcc were to permit implementation of lightsquared’s proposal as is terrestrial broadband wireless operations would create harmful interference to gps receivers within range of such operations 

many of our products use other radio frequency bands together with the gnss signal to provide enhanced gnss capabilities such as realtime kinematics precision the continuing availability of these nongnss radio frequencies is essential to provide enhanced gnss products to our precision survey agriculture and construction machine controls markets in addition emissions from other services and equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or inband may impair the utility and reliability of our products any regulatory changes in spectrum allocation or in allowable operating conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have certain products such as gps rtk systems and surveying and mapping systems that use integrated radio communication technology requiring access to available radio frequencies allocated to local government some bands are experiencing congestion in the us the fcc announced that it will require migration of radio technology from wideband to narrowband operations in these bands the rules require by 2013 either migration of users to narrowband channels or utilization by users of technology that achieves equivalent efficiency to narrowband channels congestion in the channels could cause fcc coordinators to restrict or refuse licenses an inability to obtain access to these radio frequencies by end users could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

many of our products rely on gnss technology the gps and other satellite systems which may become inoperable and result in lost revenue 

gnss technology gps satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage many of the gps satellites currently in orbit were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of 30 satellites in place some have already been in operation for more than 12 years to repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites a reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities gps satellites and ground control segments are being modernized gps modernization software updates can cause problems we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of gps updates 

as the only complete gnss currently in operation we are dependent on continued operation of gps gps is operated by the u s government which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps however if the policy were to change and gps were no longer supported by the u s government or if user fees were imposed it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

many of our products also use signals from systems that augment gps such as the wide area augmentation system and national differential gps system many of these augmentation systems are operated by the federal government and rely on continued funding and maintenance of these systems in addition some of our products also use satellite signals from the russian glonass system any curtailment of the operating capability of these systems could result in decreased user capability thereby impacting our markets 

the european community has begun development of an independent radio navigation satellite system known as galileo we have access to the preliminary signal design which is subject to change and which requires a commercial license from galileo authorities although an operational galileo system is several years away if we are unable to develop a timely commercial product or obtain a timely commercial license it could result in lost revenue which could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war terrorism or civil unrest 

acts of war acts of terrorism or other circumstances of civil unrest especially any directed at the gps signals could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may invoke a redeployment of the satellites used in gps or interruptions of the system civil unrest or other political activities may impact regional economies through work stoppages and limitations on foreign business transactions to the extent that such interruptions result in delays or cancellations of orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and although we hedge against these risks our attempts to hedge could be unsuccessful and expose us to losses 

a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the us and as such we face exposure to movements in nonus currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows fluctuation in currency impacts our operating results 

currently we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities our attempts to hedge against these risks could be unsuccessful and expose us to losses 

our debt could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations 

we have an existing unsecured revolving credit agreement under which we have an ability to borrow an aggregate amount of up to 300 million as of december 31 2010 1510 million was outstanding under this line of credit debt incurred under this agreement could have important consequences such as 

 

  

  

  

 additionally if we were to default under our amended credit agreement and were unable to obtain a waiver for such a default interest on the obligations would accrue at an increased rate and the lenders could accelerate our obligations under the amended credit agreement however that acceleration will be automatic in the case of bankruptcy and insolvency events of default additionally our subsidiaries that have guaranteed the amended credit agreement could be required to pay the full amount of our obligations under the amended credit agreement any such action on the part of the lenders against us could harm our financial condition 

we may not be able to enter into or maintain important alliances 

we believe that in certain business opportunities our success will depend on our ability to form and maintain alliances with industry participants such as caterpillar nikon and cnh global our failure to form and maintain such alliances or the preemption of such alliances by actions of competitors or us will adversely affect our ability to penetrate emerging markets we also utilize dealer networks including those affiliated with some of our strategic allies such as caterpillar and cnh global to market sell and service some of our products disruption of dealer coverage within a specific geographic market could cause difficulties in marketing selling or servicing our products and have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition moreover dealers who carry products that compete with our products may focus their inventory purchases and sales efforts on goods provided by competitors due to industry demand or profitability such inventory adjustments and sourcing decisions can adversely impact our sales financial condition and results of operations if we experience problems from current or future alliances or our dealer network it could harm our operating results and we may not be able to realize value from any such strategic alliances 

we face competition in our markets which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition 

our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price quality and performance of our products the level of customer service the development of new technology and our ability to participate in emerging markets within each of our markets we encounter direct competition from other gps software optical and laser suppliers and competition may intensify from various larger us and nonus competitors and new market entrants particularly from emerging markets such as china and india the competition in the future may in some cases result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the future against existing and additional competitors will depend largely on our ability to execute our strategy to provide systems and products with significantly differentiated features compared to currently available products we may not be able to implement this strategy successfully and our products may not be competitive with other technologies or products that may 

  

be developed by our competitors many of whom have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing sales and other resources than we do 

some of our software relies on third party technologies including open source software and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies or if our software becomes incompatible with these technologies our product and services development may be delayed or our software may fail 

we rely on software that we license from third parties including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all and the software may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors resulting in development delays or software failure some of these software licenses are subject to annual renewals at the discretion of the licensors in many cases if we were to breach a provision of these license agreements the licensor could terminate the agreement without penalty we license technologies and patents underlying some of our software from third parties and the loss of these licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we also incorporate open source software into our products although we monitor our use of open source closely the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market or sell our products or to develop new products in such event we could be required to seek licenses from thirdparties in order to continue offering our products to disclose and offer royaltyfree licenses in connection with our own source code to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis any of which could adversely affect our business 

additionally errors viruses or bugs may also be present in software that we license from third parties and incorporate into our products or in third party software that our customers use in conjunction with our software in addition our customers’ proprietary software and network firewall protections may corrupt data from our products and create difficulties in implementing our solutions changes to third party software that our customers use in conjunction with our software could also render our applications inoperable the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such software or any defects in or compatibility issues with any third party software could result in increased costs or in delays or reductions in software releases or updates until such issues have been resolved could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and future prospects 

we are subject to the impact of governmental and other similar certifications and failure to obtain the requisite certifications could harm our operating results 

we market certain products that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold for example ce certification for radiated emissions is required for most gps receiver and data communications products sold in the european community an inability to obtain such certifications in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our operating results also some of our products that use integrated radio communication technology require product type certification and some products require an end user to obtain licensing from the fcc for frequencyband usage these are secondary licenses that are subject to certain restrictions an inability or delay in obtaining such certifications or changes to the rules by the fcc could adversely affect our ability to bring our products to market which could harm our customer relationships and therefore our operating results any failure to obtain the requisite certifications could also harm our operating results 

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect an investment in our common stock 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile during fiscal 2010 our stock price ranged from 2285 to 4219 we believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate perhaps substantially including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of “hightech” companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the market price of our common stock may decline 

changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income in future periods 

a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we are currently in various stages of multiple year examinations by federal state and foreign taxing authorities including an audit of our 2008 through 2009 tax years by the us internal revenue service or irs among other things the irs is examining our intercompany transfer pricing our effective tax rate is based on the geographic mix of earnings statutory rates intercompany transfer pricing and enacted tax rules if the irs or the taxing authorities of any other jurisdiction were to successfully challenge a material tax position we could become subject to higher taxes and our earnings would be adversely affected in addition proposals for changes in us tax laws that may be considered or adopted in the future could subject the company to higher taxes or result in changes to tax law provisions that currently provide favorable tax treatment

executive level overview 

trimble’s focus is on combining positioning technology with wireless communication and application capabilities to create systemlevel solutions that enhance productivity and accuracy for our customers the majority of our markets are enduser markets including engineering and construction firms governmental organizations public safety workers farmers and companies who must manage fleets of mobile workers and assets we also provide components to original equipment manufacturers to incorporate into their products in the end user markets we provide a system that includes a hardware platform that may contain software and customer support some examples of our solutions include products that automate and simplify the process of surveying land products that automate the utilization of equipment such as tractors and bulldozers products that enable a company to manage its mobile workforce and assets and products that allow municipalities to manage their fixed assets in addition we also provide software applications on a standalone basis for example we provide software for project management on construction sites to achieve distribution marketing production and technology advantages in our targeted markets we manage our operations in the following four segments engineering and construction field solutions mobile solutions and advanced devices 

solutions targeted at the enduser make up a significant majority of our revenue to create compelling products we must attain an understanding of the end users’ needs and work flow and how locationbased technology can enable that end user to work faster more efficiently and more accurately we use this knowledge to create highly innovative products that change the way work is done by the enduser with the exception of our mobile solutions and advanced devices segments our products are generally sold through a dealer channel and it is crucial that we maintain a proficient global thirdparty distribution channel 

we continued to execute our strategy with a series of actions that can be summarized in three categories 

reinforcing our position in existing markets 

we believe these markets continue to be underpenetrated and provide us with additional substantial potential for substituting our technology for traditional methods we are continuing to develop new products and to strengthen our distribution channels in order to expand our market in our engineering and construction segment we introduced new and enhanced systems for our optical total station portfolio that provide better accuracy and improve surveyor productivity we also introduced the new trimble tunnel construction solution which streamlines the precision construction of road and railway tunnels we released the new generation of gps pathfinder ® proxrt receiver which provides decimeter accuracy and includes support for omnistar glonass and galileo with trimble 360 receiver technology we further expanded our network of sitech technology dealers during the year by adding more than thirty new sitech dealerships these dealers represent trimble and caterpillar machine control systems for the contractor’s entire fleet of heavy equipment regardless of machine brand 

in our field solutions segment the agriculture division introduced additional capabilities for the fieldiq crop input control system that allows operators to control the application rate of seed liquid or granular materials saving costs by preventing seed and fertilizer overlap we also introduced the cfx750 display our newest touch screen display which offers affordable guidance steering and precision agriculture functionality and is compatible with the fieldiq system in the water management sector we introduced ezsurface for farm surface and subsurface drainage applications that will allow farmers and drainage contractors to analyze fields surveyed by viewing 3d models as well as ezsync which will allow farmers and drainage contractors to wirelessly deliver completed drainage designs to the fmx displays via trimble’s connected farm solutions 

in our mobile solutions segment we introduced the sitefid™ integrated gas monitoring solution for the environmental services market which provides consultants and landfill operators with an endtoend solution we also introduced the addition of the trimble driversafety solution to our mobile resource management portfolio the launch of this global safety initiative help fleets become safer more productive and more fuel efficient by providing realtime feedback of unsafe maneuvers to drivers and a comprehensive picture for safety managers and fleet operation teams to accurately measure and mitigate fleet safety risks 

  

in our advanced devices segment we introduced the new version of our postprocessing software for mobile mapping and positioning which is designed to enhance the productivity of mobile mapping and features an allnew inertiallyaided precise point positioning engine and enhanced smoothing algorithm we also introduced the condor family of gps modules which feature major advancements in signal tracking for applications working in poor signal environments 

extending our position in new and existing markets through new product categories 

 we are utilizing the strength of the trimble brand in our markets to expand our revenue by bringing new products to new and existing users in our engineering and construction segment our acquisition of definiens’ earth sciences ecognition software assets expanded our geospatial portfolio furthermore the acquisition of the terralite xps assets from novariant expands our technology suite and improves the productivity of surface mining and other highvalue site operations challenged by limited or no gps coverage the acquisition of accubid broadens our industry leading “bim to field” solutions for mechanical electrical and plumbing contractors to automate project estimating and management modeling detailing layout and construction in our mobile solutions segment our acquisition of punch telematix enables us to grow our european business by offering a full solution set to both light commercial vehicle and heavy goods vehicle markets across europe in addition our acquisition of tata autocomp mobility telematics limited allows us to further expand our broad range of telematics and other mobile resource management solutions for the indian market during the year we also acquired cengea solutions which is a provider of spatiallyenabled business operations and supply chain management software for the forestry agriculture and natural resource industries this acquisition allows us to provide productivity solutions that transform operations across the continuum of forest management activities in our advanced devices segment the acquisition of thingmagic’s radio frequency identification or rfid technology and system integration expertise will allow us to build more comprehensive and offer advanced development services to facilitate the integration of rfid into a wide range of applications 

bringing existing technology to new markets 

 we continue to reinforce our position in existing markets and position ourselves in newer markets that will serve as important sources of future growth our efforts are focused in africa china india the middleeast and russia during the year we formed a joint venture in russia with russian space systems which will be responsible for selling commercial gnss geodetic network infrastructure systems localized for russia and the commonwealth of independent states or cis in addition we continue our expansion of sitech dealerships during 2010 new sitech locations were established in china india brazil mexico russia indonesia the czech republic and the philippines among other locations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements we consider the accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting policies these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

revenue recognition 

we elected to early adopt new revenue accounting guidance related to arrangements with multiple deliverables at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2010 on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or materially modified after january 1 2010 

we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists shipment has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer or is uncertain revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 

contracts andor customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement shipping documents and customer acceptance when applicable are used to verify delivery we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analyses as well as the customer’s payment history 

  

revenue for orders is generally not recognized until the product is shipped and title has transferred to the buyer we bear all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods up to that point our shipment terms for us orders and international orders fulfilled from our european distribution center typically provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the carrier named by the buyer at the named place or point if no precise point is indicated by the buyer we may choose within the place or range stipulated where the carrier will take the goods into carrier’s charge other shipment terms may provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the buyer shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 

revenue from sales to distributors and resellers is recognized upon shipment assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met distributors and resellers do not typically have a right of return 

revenue from purchased extended warranty and post contract support pcs agreements is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the warranty or support period 

we present revenue net of sales taxes and any similar assessments 

our software arrangements generally consist of a perpetual license fee and pcs we generally have established vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for our pcs contracts based on the renewal rate the remaining value of the software arrangement is allocated to the license fee using the residual method license revenue is primarily recognized when the software has been delivered and fair value has been established for all remaining undelivered elements 

our multiple deliverable product offerings include hardware with embedded firmware extended warranty and pcs services which are considered separate units of accounting for certain of our products software and nonsoftware components function together to deliver the tangible product’s essential functionality 

some of our subscription product offerings include hardware subscription services and extended warranty under our hosted arrangements the customer typically does not have the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without incurring a significant penalty and it is not feasible for the customer to run the software either on its own hardware or on a thirdparty’s hardware upfront fees related to our hosted solutions typically consist of amounts for the invehicle enabling hardware device and peripherals 

in evaluating the revenue recognition for agreements which contain multiple deliverable arrangements under the new accounting guidance we determined that in certain instances we were not able to establish vsoe for some or all deliverables in an arrangement as we infrequently sold each element on a standalone basis did not price products within a narrow range or had a limited sales history when vsoe cannot be established we attempt to establish the selling price of each element based on relevant thirdparty evidence tpe tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately generally our gotomarket strategy differs from that of competitors and offerings may contain a significant level of proprietary technology customization or differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained furthermore we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products’ selling prices are on a standalone basis therefore we typically are not able to establish the selling price of an element based on tpe 

when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe we use our best estimate of selling price besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis besp is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a standalone basis or for new or highly customized offerings we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including but not limited to pricing practices market conditions competitive landscape internal costs geographies and gross margin the determination of besp is made through consultation with and formal approval by our management taking into consideration our gotomarket strategy 

total revenue as reported and pro forma total revenues that would have been reported for the fiscal year ended december 31 2010 if the transactions entered into after january 1 2010 were subject to previous accounting guidance are shown in the following table 

 

 the impact of the revised accounting guidance to total revenue during the fiscal year ended december 31 2010 was attributable to the reallocation of discounts to revenue deliverables the recognition of hardware revenue 

  

associated with subscription contracts upon delivery which was previously recognized ratably over the contract period and the ability to assign selling price to undelivered elements which previously required vsoe 

allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns 

our accounts receivable balance net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns reserve was 2228 million as of december 31 2010 as compared with 2023 million as of january 1 2010 the allowance for doubtful accounts was 34 million and 39 million as of december 31 2010 and january 1 2010 respectively we evaluate ongoing collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors such as age of the accounts receivable balances credit quality historical experience and current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us a specific allowance for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 

a reserve for sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates experienced in the ordinary course of business the reserve for sales returns as of december 31 2010 and january 1 2010 was 16 million and 17 million respectively for estimated future returns that were recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established our revenue could be adversely affected 

inventory valuation 

our inventories net balance was 1929 million as of december 31 2010 as compared with 1440 million as of january 1 2010 our inventory allowances as of december 31 2010 were 318 million as compared with 281 million as of january 1 2010 our inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or market adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value if required are made for estimated excess obsolescence or impaired balances factors influencing these adjustments include decline in demand technological changes product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues if actual factors are less favorable than those projected by us additional inventory writedowns may be required 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred tax assets or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized 

relative to uncertain tax positions we only recognize the tax benefit if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement our practice is to recognize interest andor penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 

our valuation allowance is primarily attributable to acquired net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize these deferred tax assets and accordingly a valuation allowance has been provided for such amounts beginning in 2009 we adopted the revised accounting guidance for business combinations under which such valuation allowance adjustments associated with an acquisition closing after january 3 2009 and after the measurement period are recorded through income tax expense prior to january 3 2009 these adjustments were required to be recognized by adjusting the purchase price related to the acquisition 

goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination beginning in fiscal 2009 our identifiable intangible assets now include inprocess research and development based on the revised accounting guidance for business combinations intangible assets acquired individually with a group of other assets or in a business combination are recorded at fair value identifiable intangible assets are comprised of distribution channels and distribution rights patents licenses technology acquired backlog trademarks and inprocess research and development identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straightline method reflecting the pattern of economic benefits associated with these assets and have estimated 

  

useful lives ranging from one to ten years with a weighted average useful life of 64 years goodwill is not subject to amortization but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment applying a fairvalue based test 

impairment of goodwill intangible assets and other longlived assets 

we evaluate goodwill at a minimum on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing a twostep process first impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit’s carrying amount including goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a discounted cash flow approach if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in step two the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill the difference is recognized as an impairment loss as of december 31 2010 for each reporting unit our estimated fair values exceeded the carry values by substantial margins 

depreciation and amortization of the intangible assets and other longlived assets is provided using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives reflecting the pattern of economic benefits associated with these assets changes in circumstances such as technological advances changes to our business model or changes in the capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives of intangible assets or other longlived assets differing from initial estimates in those cases where we determine that the useful life of an asset should be revised the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value will be expensed and the residual value is depreciated over its revised remaining useful life these assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable based on their future cash flows the estimated future cash flows are based upon among other things assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows the assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value 

warranty costs 

the liability for product warranties was 129 million as of december 31 2010 as compared with 147 million as of january 1 2010 we accrue for warranty costs as part of cost of sales based on associated material product costs technical support labor costs and costs incurred by third parties performing work on our behalf our expected future cost is primarily estimated based upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment the products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to three years and in some instances up to 55 years 

while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates revisions to the estimated warranty accrual and related costs may be required 

stockbased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to our employees and directors based on estimated fair values stockbased compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of income for fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 includes compensation expense for stock options granted prior to but not yet vested as of december 30 2005 the grant date fair value of these options was estimated using the blackscholes optionspricing model the grant date fair value for options granted subsequent to december 30 2005 is estimated using a binomial valuation model the fair value of rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans is estimated using the blackscholes optionpricing model 

the determination of fair value of sharebased payment awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors riskfree interest rates and expected dividends in addition the binomial model incorporates actual optionpricing behavior and changes in volatility over the option’s contractual term 

  

beginning in fiscal 2006 our expected stock price volatility for stock purchase rights has been based on implied volatilities of traded options on our stock and our expected stock price volatility for stock options is based on a combination of our historical stock price volatility for the period commensurate with the expected life of the stock option and the implied volatility of traded options the use of implied volatilities was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our stock with terms similar to our awards and also upon our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility however because the expected life of our stock options is greater than the terms of our traded options we used a combination of our historical stock price volatility commensurate with the expected life of our stock options and implied volatility of traded options 

we estimated the expected life of the awards based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and postvesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the options and purchase rights the riskfree interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the expected term of the awards 

we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future accordingly our expected dividend yield is zero 

because stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income for fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures the stockbased compensation guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 

if factors change and we employ different assumptions to determine the fair value of our sharebased payment awards granted in future periods the compensation expense that we record under it may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period in addition valuation models including the blackscholes and binomial models may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stockbased compensation consequently there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stockbased compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise expiration early termination or forfeiture of those stockbased payments in the future certain stockbased payments such as employee stock options may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements alternatively values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements

results of operations 

overview 

the following table is a summary of revenue gross margin and operating income for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

 

 basis of presentation 

we have a 5253 week fiscal year ending on the friday nearest to december 31 which for fiscal 2010 was december 31 2010 fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 were both 52week years fiscal 2008 was a 53week year 

revenue 

in fiscal 2010 total revenue increased by 1677 million or 15 to 129 billion from 113 billion in fiscal 2009 the increase in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to stronger performances in the engineering and 

  

construction and field solutions segments engineering and construction revenue increased 1405 million or 24 field solutions increased 264 million or 9 advanced devices increased 14 million or 1 slightly offset by a decrease in mobile solutions of 06 million or less than 1 as compared to fiscal 2009 in fiscal 2010 the revenue growth in engineering and construction reflected a return to growth across the us and rest of the world markets and a strong agricultural environment 

in fiscal 2009 total revenue decreased by 2030 million or 15 to 113 billion from 133 billion in fiscal 2008 the decrease in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to slower sales in the engineering and construction segment engineering and construction revenue decreased 1631 million or 22 field solutions decreased 90 million or 3 mobile solutions decreased 122 million or 7 and advanced devices decreased 187 million or 16 as compared to fiscal 2008 in fiscal 2009 the revenue decline was primarily due to recessionary conditions in the us and european markets 

 during the 2010 fiscal year sales to customers in the united states represented 46 europe represented 22 asia pacific represented 18 and other regions represented 14 of our total revenue during fiscal 2009 sales to customers in the united states represented 50 europe represented 23 asia pacific represented 17 and other regions represented 10 of our total revenue during fiscal 2008 sales to customers in the united states represented 49 europe represented 25 asia pacific represented 14 and other regions represented 12 of our total revenue we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue 

 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenue in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 it is possible however that in future periods the failure of one or more large customers to purchase products in quantities anticipated by us may adversely affect the results of operations 

gross margin 

our gross margin varies due to a number of factors including product mix pricing distribution channel used effects of production volumes new product startup costs and foreign currency translations 

in fiscal 2010 our gross margin increased by 956 million as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to higher revenue gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 499 in fiscal 2010 and 488 in fiscal 2009 the increase in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to improved product mix in engineering and construction and field solutions partially offset by the loss of a large high margin customer in mobile solutions 

in fiscal 2009 our gross margin decreased by 993 million as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to lower revenue gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 488 both in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 the consistency in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions in engineering and construction and improved product mix in field solutions offset by lower revenue as a percentage of fixed costs 

 because of potential product mix changes within and among the industry markets market pressures on unit selling prices fluctuations in unit manufacturing costs including increases in component prices and other factors current level gross margin cannot be assured 

operating income 

operating income increased by 418 million for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 operating income as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2010 was 99 as compared to 76 for fiscal 2009 the increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher revenue and associated gross margin the increase in operating income percentage was primarily due to improved operating expense leverage primarily in engineering and construction and due to higher revenue 

operating income decreased by 996 million for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 operating income as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2009 was 76 as compared to 140 for fiscal 2008 the decrease in operating income was primarily driven by lower revenue and associated gross margin the decrease in operating income percentage was primarily due by decreased operating expense leverage primarily in engineering and construction due to lower revenue 

results by segment 

to achieve distribution marketing production and technology advantages in our targeted markets we manage our operations in the following four segments engineering and construction field solutions mobile solutions 

  

and advanced devices operating income equals net revenue less cost of sales and operating expense excluding general corporate expense amortization of purchased intangible assets amortization of inventory stepup nonrecurring acquisition costs and restructuring charges 

the following table is a breakdown of revenue and operating income by segment for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

 

 unallocated corporate expense includes general corporate expense amortization of inventory stepup and nonrecurring acquisition costs a reconciliation of our consolidated segment operating income to consolidated income before income taxes follows 

 

 engineering and construction 

engineering and construction revenue increased by 1405 million or 24 while segment operating income increased by 527 million or 904 for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 the revenue increase reflected a return to growth across the us and rest of the world markets operating income increased primarily due to higher revenue and increased operating leverage 

engineering and construction revenue decreased by 1631 million or 22 while segment operating income decreased by 677 million or 537 for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 the revenue decrease was primarily due to recessionary conditions in the us and european markets operating income decreased as a result of lower revenue partially offset by a reduction in operating expense resulting from our restructuring activities and overall expense control 

field solutions 

  

field solutions revenue increased by 264 million or 9 while segment operating income increased by 119 million or 114 for fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 the increase in revenue was driven primarily by new products and increased farmer demand for agricultural products operating income increased primarily due to higher revenue in our agricultural business 

field solutions revenue decreased by approximately 90 million or 3 while segment operating income decreased by 50 million or 46 for fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 the decrease in revenue was driven primarily by slower sales of agriculture products both in the us and internationally operating income decreased primarily due to lower revenue 

mobile solutions 

mobile solutions revenue decreased by 06 million or less than 1 while segment operating income decreased by 125 million or 869 for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 revenue was slightly down primarily due to the loss of a large customer in the second quarter of 2010 partially offset by revenue from acquisitions operating income decline was primarily due to the loss of a large high margin customer and higher operating expense associated with acquisitions not applicable with prior year 

mobile solutions revenue decreased by 122 million or 7 while segment operating income increased by 30 million or 266 for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 revenue was down primarily due to decrease in ready mix hardware and subscription revenue as well as the impact in the prior year of the recognition of large nonrecurring items operating income increased primarily due to gross margin improvement and a reduction in operating expenses 

advanced devices 

advanced devices revenue increased by 14 million or 1 and segment operating income increased by 11 million or 64 for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 the increase in revenue reflected a return to growth in both our component and gnss position and orientation systems operating income increased primarily due to the increase in revenue as well as gross margin percentage increases due to product mix 

advanced devices revenue decreased by 187 million or 16 and segment operating income decreased by 72 million or 295 for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 the decrease in revenue was primarily driven by slower sales of component technologies products operating income decreased primarily due to the decrease in revenue partially offset by lower spending due to operating expense control 

research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 

the following table shows research and development “rd” sales and marketing and general and administrative “ga” expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions of those operating expenses below 

 

 overall rd sales and marketing and ga expenses increased by approximately 562 million in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

research and development expense increased by 135 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to the impact of new rd expense as a result of acquisitions an increase in compensation related expense an increase in rd materials and an increase due to foreign currency exchange rates all of our rd costs have been expensed as incurred overall research and development spending was approximately 11 of revenue in fiscal 2010 and 12 in fiscal 2009 

  

research and development expense decreased by 116 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to the impact of a decrease in compensation related expense a decrease in rd materials and a decrease due to foreign currency exchange rates partially offset by new rd expense as a result of acquisitions not applicable in the prior year all of our rd costs have been expensed as incurred overall research and development spending was approximately 12 of revenue in fiscal 2009 and 11 in fiscal 2008 

 we believe that the development and introduction of new products are critical to our future success and we expect to continue active development of new products 

sales and marketing expense increased by 253 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 the increase was primarily due to new sales and marketing expenses as a result of acquisitions an increase in compensation related expense an increase in trade shows and marketing literature expense and an increase due to foreign currency exchange rates spending overall remained relatively constant at approximately 17 of revenue in both fiscal 2010 and 2009 

sales and marketing expense decreased by 64 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in travel and trade show expense and a decrease due to foreign currency exchange rates partially offset by new sales and marketing expenses as a result of acquisitions not applicable in the prior year spending overall was approximately 17 of revenue in fiscal 2009 compared to 15 in fiscal 2008 

 our future growth will depend in part on the timely development and continued viability of the markets in which we currently compete as well as our ability to continue to identify and develop new markets for our products 

general and administrative expense increased by 175 million in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 the increase was primarily due to additional ga expenses as a result of acquisitions an increase in compensation related expense including stock compensation expense and an increase due to foreign currency exchange rates spending overall remained relatively constant at approximately 9 of revenue in both fiscal 2010 and 2009 

general and administrative expense increased by 68 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to additional ga expenses as a result of acquisitions increased deferred compensation plan liabilities and stock compensation expense partially offset by foreign exchange rates spending overall was at approximately 9 of revenue in fiscal 2009 compared to 7 in fiscal 2008 

other operating expenses 

restructuring expense 

restructuring expense for the three years ended december 31 2010 was as follows 

 

 during fiscal 2010 restructuring expense of 20 million was related to decisions to streamline processes and reduce the cost structure of the company of the total restructuring expense 16 million is presented as a separate line within operating expense and 04 million is included within cost of sales on our consolidated statements of income expense related to the decisions made through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was fully accrued as of december 31 2010 

during fiscal 2009 restructuring expense of 108 million was related to decisions to streamline processes and reduce the cost structure of the company of the total restructuring expense 64 million is presented as a separate line within operating expense and 44 million was included within cost of sales on our consolidated statements of income 

during fiscal 2008 restructuring expense of 46 million was related to decisions to streamline processes and reduce the cost structure of the company of the total restructuring expense 27 million is presented as a separate line within operating expense on our consolidated statements of income and 19 million was included within cost of sales 

  

restructuring liability 

the following table summarizes the restructuring activity for 2009 and 2010 in thousands 

 

 as of december 31 2010 the 16 million restructuring accrual consists of severance and benefits it is included in other current liabilities and is expected to be settled in fiscal 2011 

amortization of purchased and other intangible assets 

 

 total amortization expense of purchased and other intangible assets was 576 million in fiscal 2010 of which 249 million was recorded in cost of sales and 327 million was recorded in operating expense total amortization expense of purchased and other intangibles represented 45 of revenue in fiscal 2010 an increase of 50 million from fiscal 2009 when it represented 47 of revenue the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of certain technology and patent intangibles as a result of acquisitions made in fiscal 2010 as well as fiscal 2009 acquisition intangibles that included a full year impact of amortization expense in fiscal 2010 

total amortization expense of purchased and other intangible assets was 527 million in fiscal 2009 of which 223 million was recorded in cost of sales and 303 million was recorded in operating expense total amortization expense of purchased and other intangibles represented 47 of revenue in fiscal 2009 an increase of 76 million from fiscal 2008 when it represented 34 of revenue the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of certain technology and patent intangibles as a result of acquisitions made in fiscal 2009 as well as fiscal 2008 acquisition intangibles that included a full year impact of amortization expense in fiscal 2009 

nonoperating income net 

the following table shows nonoperating income net for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions of those expenses below 

 

 total nonoperating income net increased by 117 million during fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 the increase was due to higher income from joint ventures and changes in our deferred compensation gains losses included in other income net partially offset by a change in foreign exchange gains losses 

  

total nonoperating income net decreased by 42 million during fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 the decrease was due to lower income from joint ventures and a change in foreign exchange gains losses partially offset by changes in our deferred compensation gains losses included in other income net 

income tax provision 

our effective income tax rate for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 was 27 27 and 26 respectively the 2010 rate was less than the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the geographical mix of our pretax income and valuation allowance release offset by the net impact of the us internal revenue service irs audit settlement in 2010 the 2009 and 2008 rates were less than the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the geographical mix of our pretax income 

in may 2010 the irs closed its examination of our income tax returns for the fiscal years 2005 through 2007 as part of the audit the irs examined and adjusted the valuation and payment arrangement for the 2006 nonexclusive license of specified trimble intellectual property rights to a foreignbased trimble subsidiary the consideration for this license was to be paid over time and was established based on our estimate of the ongoing royalties that would have been received in a similar license arrangement to an unrelated thirdparty licensee pursuant to the audit settlement we agreed to revise the valuation and to accelerate the payments under the existing royalty arrangement resulting in a net impact of 275 million in the second quarter of 2010 net of a release of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits the resolution of the 2005 through 2007 audit resulted in a tax assessment to us of 425 million and interest of 72 million for a total of 497 million that we paid on july 15 2010 additionally as a result of the settlement we incurred state income taxes and interest of approximately 25 million 

litigation matters 

 from time to time we are involved in litigation arising out of the ordinary course of our business there are no known claims or pending litigation that are expected to have a material effect on our overall financial position results of operations or liquidity 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than lease commitments incurred in the normal course of business see contractual obligations table below we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities guarantee contracts retained or contingent interests in transferred assets or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity we do not have any majorityowned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements additionally we do not have any interest in or relationship with any special purpose entities 

in the normal course of business to facilitate sales of its products we indemnify other parties including customers lessors and parties to other transactions with us with respect to certain matters we have agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties these agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents 

it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under these agreements were not material and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2010 and january 1 2010 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 cash and cash equivalents 

as of december 31 2010 cash and cash equivalents totaled 2208 million compared to 2738 million at january 2 2009 we had debt of 1532 million at december 31 2010 compared to 1515 million at january 1 2010 

 our ability to continue to generate cash from operations will depend in large part on profitability the rate of collections of accounts receivable our inventory turns and our ability to manage other areas of working capital 

 we believe that our cash and cash equivalents together with our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs and stock purchases under the stock repurchase program for at least the next twelve months as well as repayment of any outstanding balance under our credit facility 

 we anticipate that planned capital expenditures primarily for computer equipment software manufacturing tools and test equipment and leasehold improvements associated with business expansion will constitute a partial use of our cash resources decisions related to how much cash is used for investing are influenced by the expected amount of cash to be provided by operations 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 1240 million for fiscal 2010 as compared to 1946 million for fiscal 2009 the decrease of 706 million was driven by an increase in inventory spending a 497 million payment associated with an irs settlement partially offset by an increase in net income before noncash depreciation and amortization accounts payable and accrued compensation and benefits 

cash provided by operating activities was 1946 million for fiscal 2009 as compared to 1761 million for fiscal 2008 the increase of 186 million was due to a decrease in inventories and an increase in accounts payable accrued compensation and benefits and deferred revenue partially offset by a decrease in net income before noncash depreciation and amortization and an increase in accounts receivable 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 1564 million for fiscal 2010 as compared to 839 million for fiscal 2009 the increase was primarily due to higher cash used for business and for intangible asset acquisitions in fiscal 2010 

cash used in investing activities was 839 million for fiscal 2009 as compared to 1267 million for fiscal 2008 the decrease was primarily due to less cash used for acquisitions in fiscal 2009 

financing activities 

cash used by financing activities was 202 million for fiscal 2010 as compared to cash provided of 161 million during fiscal 2009 the decrease of 363 million was primarily due to the stock repurchases in the first nine months of fiscal 2010 partially offset by common stock issued upon the exercise of stock options 

cash provided by financing activities was 161 million for fiscal 2009 as compared to cash used of 64 million during fiscal 2008 the increase of 226 million was primarily due to prior year stock repurchase activities partially offset by prior year increase in debt 

  

accounts receivable and inventory metrics 

 

 accounts receivable days sales outstanding were down slightly at 63 days as of december 31 2010 as compared to 66 days as of january 1 2010 our accounts receivable days sales outstanding are calculated based on ending accounts receivable net divided by revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter times a quarterly average of 91 days our inventory turns were at 38 for fiscal 2010 as compared to 34 for fiscal 2009 our inventory turnover is based on the total cost of sales for the fiscal period over the average inventory for the corresponding fiscal period 

debt 

at the end of fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 our total debt was comprised primarily of our revolving credit line in the amount of 1510 million as of december 31 2010 and january 1 2010 we had notes payable totaling approximately 19 million and 05 million respectively our outstanding notes payable as of december 31 2010 consisted primarily of notes payable to noncontrolling interest holders of one of our consolidated subsidiaries the notes bear interest at 6 and have undefined payment terms but are callable with a six month notification our outstanding notes payable balance as of january 1 2010 consisted primarily of government loans to foreign subsidiaries 

on july 28 2005 we entered into a 200 million unsecured revolving credit agreement the 2005 credit facility with a syndicate of 10 banks with the bank of nova scotia as the administrative agent on february 16 2007 we amended our existing 200 million unsecured revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of 11 banks with the bank of nova scotia as the administrative agent the 2007 credit facility under the 2007 credit facility we exercised the option in the existing credit agreement to increase the availability under the revolving credit line by 100 million for an aggregate availability of up to 300 million and extended the maturity date of the revolving credit line by 18 months from july 2010 to february 2012 up to 25 million of the availability under the revolving credit line may be used to issue letters of credit and up to 20 million may be used for paying off other debts or loans the maximum leverage ratio under the 2007 credit facility is 300100 the funds available under the new 2007 credit facility may be used by us for acquisitions stock repurchases and general corporate purposes as of august 20 2008 we amended the 2007 credit facility to allow us to redeem retire or purchase trimble common stock without limitation so long as no default or unmatured default then existed and leverage ratio for the two most recently completed periods was less than 200100 in addition the definition of the fixed charge was amended to exclude the impact of redemptions retirements or purchases of trimble common stock from the fixed charges coverage ratio we are exploring our options as to the refinancing or replacement of the 2007 credit facility for additional discussion of our debt see note 9 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

we may borrow funds under the 2007 credit facility in us dollars or in certain other currencies and borrowings will bear interest at our option at either i a base rate based on the administrative agent’s prime rate plus a margin of between 0 and 0125 depending on our leverage ratio as of our most recently ended fiscal quarter or ii a reserveadjusted rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor euro interbank offered rate euribor stockholm interbank offered rate stibor or other agreedupon rate depending on the currency borrowed plus a margin of between 0625 and 1125 depending on our leverage ratio as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter our obligations under the 2007 credit facility are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries 

the 2007 credit facility contains customary affirmative negative and financial covenants including among other requirements negative covenants that restrict our ability to dispose of assets create liens incur indebtedness repurchase stock pay dividends make acquisitions make investments enter into mergers and consolidations and make capital expenditures within certain limitations and financial covenants that require the maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios the 2007 credit facility contains events of default that include among others nonpayment of principal interest or fees breach of covenants inaccuracy of representations and warranties cross defaults to certain other indebtedness bankruptcy and insolvency events material judgments and events constituting a change of control upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default interest on the obligations will accrue at an increased rate and the lenders may accelerate our obligations under the 2007 credit facility however that acceleration will be automatic in the case of bankruptcy and insolvency events of default as of december 31 2010 we were in compliance with all financial debt covenants 

  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2010 

 

  

 total debt consists of a revolving credit line of 1510 million under our credit facilities and 19 million consisted primarily of notes payable to noncontrolling interest holders of one of our consolidated subsidiaries see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further financial information regarding longterm debt 

other purchase obligations and commitments represent open noncancelable purchase orders for material purchases with our vendors purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty our pension obligation which is not included in the table above is included in “other current liabilities” and “other noncurrent liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets additionally as of december 31 2010 we had acquisition earnouts of 41 million and holdbacks of 42 million recorded in “other current liabilities” and “other noncurrent liabilities” the maximum remaining payments which are not included in the table above including the 41 million and 42 million recorded will not exceed 258 million the remaining earnouts and holdbacks are payable through 2013 

as of december 31 2010 we had unrecognized tax benefits included in other noncurrent liabilities of 178 million including interest and penalties at this time we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with tax authorities regarding this liability and therefore such amounts are not included in the contractual obligations table above 

effect of new accounting pronouncements 

the impact of recent accounting pronouncements is disclosed in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

reconciliation of gaap to nongaap financial measures 

the following presentation includes nongaap measures our nongaap measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap measures the nongaap financial measures included in the following table are nongaap gross margin nongaap operating expenses nongaap operating income nongaap nonoperating income net nongaap income tax provision benefit nongaap net income nongaap diluted net income per share and operating leverage and nongaap segment operating income before corporate allocations these nongaap measures can be used to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance as well as our performance relative to competitors we believe some of our investors track our “core operating performance” as a means of evaluating our performance in the ordinary ongoing and customary course of our operations management also believes that looking at our core operating performance provides a supplemental way to provide consistency in period to period comparisons accordingly management excludes from nongaap those items relating to restructuring amortization of purchased intangibles stock based compensation amortization of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup nonrecurring acquisition costs and nonrecurring tax chargesbenefits of which 275 million is associated with the irs settlement and 76 million is associated with a valuation allowance release benefit for detailed explanations of the adjustments made to comparable gaap measures see items a – k below 

  

   

  

    

  

     

     nongaap operating income 

nongaap operating income increased by 456 million for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 and decreased by 805 million for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 nongaap operating income as a percentage of total revenue was 168 153 and 190 for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

the increase in operating income and operating income percentage during fiscal 2010 was primarily driven by higher revenue and associated operating leverage in the engineering and construction and field solutions partially offset by mobile solutions the decrease in operating income and operating income percentage during fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to a decrease in engineering and construction revenue and operating leverage

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors 

market interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds treasury bills commercial paper fdic insured interest and noninterest bearing bank deposits as well as bank time deposits for fiscal 2008 the main objective of these instruments was safety of principal and liquidity while maximizing return without significantly increasing risk 

 due to the shortterm nature of our cash equivalents we do not anticipate any material effect on our portfolio due to fluctuations in interest rates 

we are exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing interest rates under our senior secured credit facilities our credit facility is comprised of an unsecured revolving credit agreement with a maturity date of february 2012 we may borrow funds under the revolving credit agreement in us dollars or in certain other currencies and borrowings will bear interest as described under note 9 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2010 we had an outstanding balance on the revolving credit line of 1510 million a hypothetical 10 increase in the threemonth libor rates could result in approximately 46000 annual increase in interest expense on the existing principal balances 

 the hypothetical changes and assumptions made above will be different from what actually occurs in the future furthermore the computations do not anticipate actions that may be taken by our management should the hypothetical market changes actually occur over time as a result actual earnings effects in the future will differ from those quantified above 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on cash certain trade and intercompany receivables and payables primarily denominated in australian canadian and new zealand dollars japanese yen indian rupee south african rand swedish krona euro and british pound these contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements as the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses on the forward contracts these instruments are marked to market through earnings every period and generally range from one to three months in original maturity we do not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for trading purposes 

foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of december 31 2010 and january 1 2010 are summarized as follows in thousands 

 

  we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position utilizing our current hedging strategy

 item 1 business 

trimble navigation limited a california corporation “trimble” or “the company” or “we” or “our” or “us” provides advanced positioning product solutions typically to commercial and government users the principal application areas include surveying agriculture construction asset management mapping and mobile resource management our products provide benefits that can include lower operational costs higher productivity improved quality and compliance product examples include agricultural and construction equipment guidance systems surveying instruments systems that track fleets of vehicles and data collection systems that enable the management of large amounts of georeferenced information in addition we also manufacture components for invehicle navigation and telematics systems and timing modules used in the synchronization of wireless networks 

our products often combine knowledge of location or position with a wireless link to provide a solution for a specific application position is provided through a number of technologies including the global positioning system or gps other global navigation satellite systems or gnss and their augmentation systems and systems that use laser or optical technologies to establish position wireless communication techniques include both public networks such as cellular and private networks such as business band radio some of our products are augmented by our software this includes embedded firmware that enables the positioning solution and application software that allows the customer to make use of the positioning information 

we design and market our own products our manufacturing strategy includes a combination of inhouse assembly and third party subcontractors our global operations include major development manufacturing or logistics operations in the united states sweden germany new zealand canada the united kingdom the netherlands china and india products are sold through dealers representatives joint ventures and other channels throughout the world these channels are supported by our sales offices located in 19 countries 

we began operations in 1978 and incorporated in california in 1981 our common stock has been publicly traded on nasdaq since 1990 under the symbol trmb 

on january 17 2007 our board of directors approved a 2for1 split of all outstanding shares of the company’s common stock payable february 22 2007 to stockholders of record on february 8 2007 all shares and per share information presented have been adjusted to reflect the stock split on a retroactive basis for all periods presented 

technology overview 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from applying global navigation satellite system or gnss technology to terrestrial applications the gnss includes the network of 24 orbiting us global positioning system or gps radio navigation satellites and associated ground control that is funded and maintained by the us government and is available worldwide free of direct user fees and the russian glonass radio navigation satellite system both the european community and china have announced plans to establish future operational radio navigation satellite systems gnss positioning is based on a technique that precisely measures distances from four or more satellites the satellites continuously transmit precisely timed radio signals using extremely accurate atomic clocks a gnss receiver measures distances from the satellites in view by determining the travel time of a signal from the satellite to the receiver and then uses those distances to compute its position under normal circumstances a standalone gnss receiver is able to calculate its position at any point on earth in the earths atmosphere or in lower earth orbit to approximately 10 meters 24 hours a day much better accuracies are possible through a technique called “differential gnss” in addition to providing position gnss provides extremely accurate time measurement 

gnss accuracy is dependent upon the locations of the receiver and the number of gnss satellites that are above the horizon at any given time reception of gnss signals requires lineofsight visibility between the satellites and the receiver which can be blocked by buildings hills and dense foliage the receiver must have a line of sight to at least four satellites to determine its latitude longitude and time the accuracy of gnss may also be limited by distortion of gnss signals from ionospheric and other atmospheric conditions 

our gnss products are based on proprietary receiver technology over time the advances in positioning wireless communications and information technologies have enabled us to add more capability to our products and thereby deliver more value to our users gps is being modernized and glonass modernization is planned for example the developments in wireless technology and deployments of next generation wireless networks have enabled less expensive wireless communications these developments provide the efficient transfer of position data to locations away from the positioning field device allowing the data to be accessed by more users thereby increasing productivity this allows us to integrate visualization and design software into some of our systems as well as offer positioning services all of which make our customers more efficient at what they do 

our laser and optical products either measure distances and angles to provide a position in three dimensional space or are used as highly accurate laser references from which a position can be established the key elements of these products are typically a laser which is generally a commercially available laser diode and a complex mechanical assembly these elements are augmented by software algorithms to provide measurements and applicationspecific solutions 

business strategy 

our business strategy is developed around an analysis of several key elements 

 

 

 

business segments and markets 

we are organized into four reporting segments encompassing our various applications and product lines engineering and construction field solutions mobile solutions and advanced devices our segments are distinguished by the markets they serve each segment consists of businesses which are responsible for product development marketing sales strategy and financial performance 

engineering and construction 

products in the engineering and construction segment improve productivity and accuracy throughout the entire construction process including the initial survey planning design site preparation and building phases our products are intended to both improve the productivity of each phase as well as facilitate the entire process by improving information flow from one phase to the next 

our engineering and construction product solutions typically integrate a wide range of positioning technologies including gpsgnss laser optical 3d scanning and inertial technologies with application software wireless communications and services to provide complete solutions our integrated solutions allow customers to collect manage and analyze complex information an example is the connected site solutions for development projects the approach consists of mapping and understanding the workflow of a specific industry segment and then ensuring there is software and hardware integration between each segment of the workflow such as the building of a water supply and treatment plant for a village the work requires mapping and evaluation of water resources engineering and design construction and life cycle management the connected site plays an important role at each and every stage it ensures fast accurate exchange of data and information among field and office teams contractors and management because of its inherent flexibility and ability to evolve with a project the connected site can deliver significant contributions to the sustainable infrastructure development

 item 1a risk factors 

risks and uncertainties 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k and in any other documents to which we refer you in this form 10k before purchasing our securities the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 

current economic conditions may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict 

the company’s operations and performance depend on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of business spending which have deteriorated significantly in many countries and regions and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future uncertainties in the financial and credit markets have caused our customers to postpone purchases and continued uncertainties may reduce future sales of our products and services continued adverse economic conditions are likely to depress tax revenue of federal state and local government entities which are significant purchasers of the company’s products protectionist trade measures that may be adopted in response to the economic downturn could reduce demand for our products and services overseas with the exception primarily of our mobile solutions and advanced devices segments our products are generally sold through a dealer channel and our dealers depend on the availability of credit to finance purchases of our products for their inventory 

customer collections are our primary source of cash while we believe we have a strong customer base and have experienced strong collections in the past if the current market conditions deteriorate we may experience increased collection times or greater writeoffs which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow in addition the companys results may be adversely affected if the company is unable to market manufacture and ship new products any writeoff of goodwill could also negatively impact our financial results finally our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like or need to do so which could have an impact on our flexibility to pursue additional expansion opportunities and maintain our desired level of revenue growth in the future these and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for the company’s products and services and on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

our inability to accurately predict orders and shipments may subject our results of operations to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter 

we have not been able in the past to consistently predict when our customers will place orders and request shipments so that we cannot always accurately plan our manufacturing requirements as a result if orders and shipments differ from what we predict we may incur additional expense and build excess inventory which may require additional reserves and allowances accordingly we have limited visibility into future changes in demand and our results of operations may be subject to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter 

our operating results in each quarter may be affected by special conditions such as seasonality late quarter purchases weather and other potential issues 

due in part to the buying patterns of our customers a significant portion of our quarterly revenue occurs from orders received and immediately shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of each quarter although our operating expense tends to remain fairly predictable engineering and construction purchases tend to occur in early spring and governmental agencies tend to utilize funds available at the end of the government’s fiscal year for additional purchases at the end of our third fiscal quarter in september of each year concentrations of orders sometimes also occur at the end of our other two fiscal quarters additionally a majority of our sales force earns commissions on a quarterly basis which may cause concentrations of orders at the end of any fiscal quarter it could harm our operating results if for any reason expected sales are deferred orders are not received or shipments are delayed a few days at the end of a quarter 

we are dependent on a specific manufacturer and assembler for many of our products and on specific suppliers of critical parts for our products 

we are substantially dependent upon flextronics international limited as our preferred manufacturing partner for many of our gps products under the agreement we provide to flextronics a twelvemonth product forecast and place purchase orders with flextronics at least thirty calendar days in advance of the scheduled delivery of products to our customers depending on production lead time although purchase orders placed with flextronics are cancelable the terms of the agreement would require us to purchase from flextronics all inventory not returnable or usable by other flextronics customers accordingly if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products we may be unable to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity from flextronics to meet customers’ delivery requirements or we may accumulate excess inventories if such inventories are not usable by other flextronics customers our current contract with flextronics continues in effect until either party gives the other ninety days written notice  

in addition we rely on specific suppliers for a number of our critical components we have experienced shortages of components in the past our current reliance on specific or a limited group of suppliers involves several risks including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components reduced control over pricing and economic conditions which may adversely impact the viability of our suppliers this situation may be exacerbated during any period of economic recovery any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture such components internally could significantly delay our ability to ship our products which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our reputation and brand as well as our operating results 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate which could negatively impact our operations and our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control results in any period could be affected by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition demand for our products in any quarter or year may vary due to the seasonal buying patterns of our customers in the agricultural and engineering and construction industries the price of our common stock could decline substantially in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors which are based primarily on historical models that are not necessarily accurate representations of the future 

we are dependent on new products and if we are unable to successfully introduce them into the market our customer base may decline or fail to grow as anticipated 

our future revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to bring new products to market on a timely basis we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance of such products we may incur problems in the future in innovating and introducing new products our development stage products may not be successfully completed or if developed may not achieve significant customer acceptance if we were unable to successfully define develop and introduce competitive new products and enhance existing products our future results of operations would be adversely affected development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and we might not achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success if we are unable to introduce new products if other companies develop similar technology products or if we do not develop compelling new products our number of customers may not grow as anticipated or may decline which could harm our operating results 

the actions that we have taken in response to the global economic slowdown and our related business slowdown may not be as effective as anticipated 

we have taken actions to reduce our cost structure to more closely align our costs with our revenue levels in taking these actions we are attempting to balance the cost reductions from such initiatives against the risk of impairing our ability to operate our business and capitalize on any recovery if we do not achieve the proper balance of these costs reduction initiatives we may impair critical elements our operations the loss of which could negatively impact our ability to remain competitive in the market place or to benefit from an economic recovery we cannot assure our cost cutting efforts will achieve appropriate levels of expenses and we may take additional actions in the future 

we are dependent on proprietary technology which could result in litigation that could divert significant valuable resources 

our future success and competitive position is dependent upon our proprietary technology and we rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright law to protect our intellectual property the patents owned or licensed by us may be invalidated circumvented and challenged the rights granted under these patents may not provide competitive advantages to us any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us if at all 

others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology duplicate our technology or design around the patents owned by us in addition effective copyright patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in certain countries the steps taken by us to protect our technology might not prevent the misappropriation of such technology 

the value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many current patent filings we recognize that as new patents are issued or are brought to our attention by the holders of such patents it may be necessary for us to withdraw products from the market take a license from such patent holders or redesign our products we do not believe any of our products currently infringe patents or other proprietary rights of third parties but we cannot be certain they do not do so in addition the legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant expense of operations any such litigation could require us to incur substantial costs and divert significant valuable resources including the efforts of our technical and management personnel which harm our results of operations and financial condition 

investing in and integrating new acquisitions could be costly and may place a significant strain on our management systems and resources which could negatively impact our operating results 

we have recently acquired a number of companies and intend to continue to acquire other companies acquisitions of companies entail numerous risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a result of such acquisitions we have significant assets that include goodwill and other purchased intangibles the testing of this goodwill and intangibles for impairment under established accounting guidelines requires significant use of judgment and assumptions changes in business conditions could require adjustments to the valuation of these assets in addition losses incurred by a company in which we have an investment may have a direct impact on our financial statements or could result in our having to writedown the value of such investment any such problems in integration or adjustments to the value of the assets acquired could harm our growth strategy and could be costly and place a significant strain on our management systems and resources 

our products may contain errors or defects which could result in damage to our reputation lost revenue diverted development resources and increased service costs warranty claims and litigation 

we warrant that our products will be free of defect for various periods of time depending on the product in addition certain of our contracts include epidemic failure clauses if invoked these clauses may entitle the customer to return or obtain credits for products and inventory or to cancel outstanding purchase orders even if the products themselves are not defective 

we must develop our products quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing market and we have a history of frequently introducing new products products and services as sophisticated as ours could contain undetected errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new models or versions are released in general our products may not be free from errors or defects after commercial shipments have begun which could result in damage to our reputation lost revenue diverted development resources increased customer service and support costs warranty claims and litigation 

we are dependent on the availability of allocated bands within the radio frequency spectrum 

our gnss technology is dependent on the use of satellite signals from space and on terrestrial communication bands international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union itu a specialized technical agency of the united nations these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used 

any itu or local reallocation of radio frequency bands including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products many of our products use other radio frequency bands together with the gnss signal to provide enhanced gnss capabilities such as realtime kinematics precision the continuing availability of these nongnss radio frequencies is essential to provide enhanced gnss products to our precision survey agriculture and construction machine controls markets in addition emissions from other services and equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or inband may impair the utility and reliability of our products any regulatory changes in spectrum allocation or in allowable operating conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have certain products such as gps rtk systems and surveying and mapping systems that use integrated radio communication technology requiring access to available radio frequencies allocated to local government some bands are experiencing congestion in the us the fcc announced that it will require migration of radio technology from wideband to narrowband operations in these bands the rules require migration of users to narrowband channels by 2011 in the meantime congestion could cause fcc coordinators to restrict or refuse licenses an inability to obtain access to these radio frequencies by end users could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

many of our products rely on gnss technology the gps and other satellite systems which may become inoperable and result in lost revenue 

gnss technology gps satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage many of the gps satellites currently in orbit were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of 30 satellites in place some have already been in operation for more than 12 years to repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites a reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities gps satellites and ground control segments are being modernized gps modernization software updates can cause problems we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of gps updates 

as the only complete gnss currently in operation we are dependent on continued operation of gps gps is operated by the u s government which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps however if the policy were to change and gps were no longer supported by the u s government or if user fees were imposed it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

many of our products also use signals from systems that augment gps such as the wide area augmentation system waas and national differential gps system ndgps many of these augmentation systems are operated by the federal government and rely on continued funding and maintenance of these systems in addition some of our products also use satellite signals from the russian glonass system any curtailment of the operating capability of these systems could result in decreased user capability thereby impacting our markets 

the european community has begun development of an independent radio navigation satellite system known as galileo we have access to the preliminary signal design which is subject to change and which requires a commercial license from galileo authorities although an operational galileo system is several years away if we are unable to develop a timely commercial product or obtain a timely commercial license it could result in lost revenue which could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war or terrorism 

acts of war or acts of terrorism especially any directed at the gps signals could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may invoke a redeployment of the satellites used in gps or interruptions of the system to the extent that such interruptions result in delays or cancellations of orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and although we hedge against these risks our attempts to hedge could be unsuccessful and expose us to losses 

a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the us and as such we face exposure to movements in nonus currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows fluctuation in currency impacts our operating results 

currently we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities our attempts to hedge against these risks could be unsuccessful and expose us to losses 

our debt could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations 

we have an existing unsecured revolving credit agreement under which we have an ability to borrow an aggregate amount of up to 300 million as of january 1 2010 1510 million was outstanding under this line of credit debt incurred under this agreement could have important consequences such as 

 

 

 

 

additionally if we were to default under our amended credit agreement and were unable to obtain a waiver for such a default interest on the obligations would accrue at an increased rate and the lenders could accelerate our obligations under the amended credit agreement however that acceleration will be automatic in the case of bankruptcy and insolvency events of default additionally our subsidiaries that have guaranteed the amended credit agreement could be required to pay the full amount of our obligations under the amended credit agreement any such action on the part of the lenders against us could harm our financial condition 

we may not be able to enter into or maintain important alliances 

we believe that in certain business opportunities our success will depend on our ability to form and maintain alliances with industry participants such as caterpillar nikon and cnh global our failure to form and maintain such alliances or the preemption of such alliances by actions of competitors or us will adversely affect our ability to penetrate emerging markets if we experience problems from current or future alliances it could harm our operating results and we may not be able to realize value from any such strategic alliances 

we face competition in our markets which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition 

our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price quality and performance of our products the level of customer service the development of new technology and our ability to participate in emerging markets within each of our markets we encounter direct competition from other gps optical and laser suppliers and competition may intensify from various larger us and nonus competitors and new market entrants particularly from emerging markets such as china and india the competition in the future may in some cases result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the future against existing and additional competitors will depend largely on our ability to execute our strategy to provide systems and products with significantly differentiated features compared to currently available products we may not be able to implement this strategy successfully and our products may not be competitive with other technologies or products that may be developed by our competitors many of whom have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing sales and other resources than we do 

we are subject to the impact of governmental and other similar certifications and failure to obtain the requisite certifications could harm our operating results 

we market certain products that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold for example ce certification for radiated emissions is required for most gps receiver and data communications products sold in the european community an inability to obtain such certifications in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our operating results also some of our products that use integrated radio communication technology require product type certification and some products require an end user to obtain licensing from the fcc for frequencyband usage these are secondary licenses that are subject to certain restrictions an inability or delay in obtaining such certifications or changes to the rules by the fcc could adversely affect our ability to bring our products to market which could harm our customer relationships and therefore our operating results any failure to obtain the requisite certifications could also harm our operating results 

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect an investment in our common stock 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile during fiscal 2009 our stock price ranged from 1209 to 2585 we believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate perhaps substantially including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of hightech companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the market price of our common stock may decline 

changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income in future periods 

a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we are currently in various stages of multiple year examinations by federal state and foreign taxing authorities including an audit of our 2005 through 2008 tax years by the us internal revenue service irs among other things the irs is examining our intercompany transfer pricing our effective tax rate is based on the geographic mix of earnings statutory rates intercompany transfer pricing and enacted tax rules if the irs or the taxing authorities of any other jurisdiction were to successfully challenge a material tax position we could become subject to higher taxes and our earnings would be adversely affected in addition proposals for changes in us tax laws that may be considered or adopted in the future could subject the company to higher taxes or result in changes to tax law provisions that currently provide favorable tax treatment

stock repurchase program 

in january 2008 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program “2008 stock repurchase program” authorizing us to repurchase up to 250 million of trimble’s common stock under this program we repurchased approximately 4243000 shares of common stock in open market purchases at an average price of 2967 per share for a total of 1259 million in 2008 no shares of common stock were repurchased in 2009 the purchase price was reflected as a decrease to common stock based on the average stated value per share with the remainder to retained earnings common stock repurchases under the program were recorded based upon the trade date for accounting purposes all common shares repurchased under this program have been retired as of january 1 2010 the 2008 stock repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of 1241 million the timing and actual number of future shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price regulatory requirements capital availability and other market conditions the program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without public notice 

as of february 24 2010 there were approximately 944 holders of record of our common stock 

dividend policy 

we have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock during any period for which financial information is provided in this annual report on form 10k at this time we intend to retain future earnings if any to fund the development and growth of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 

under the existing terms of our credit facility we are allowed to pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock without limitation so long as no default or unmatured default then existed the leverage ratio for the two most recently completed periods was less than 200100 and after giving pro forma effect to such dividend or share repurchase the leverage ratio will be less than 200100 should the leverage ratio be equal to or greater than 200100 without exceeding a leverage ratio of 300100 we can pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock in any twelve 12 month period in an aggregate amount equal to fifty percent 50 of net income plus to the extent deducted in determining net income for such period noncash expenses in respect of stock options for the previous twelvemonth period plus an additional 50 million over the term of the credit facility subject to pro forma compliance with our fixed charge coverage ratio covenant otherwise dividends and share repurchases are restricted by our credit agreement 




 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that reflect our plans estimates and beliefs our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and those listed under risks factors we have attempted to identify forwardlooking statements in this report by placing an asterisk  before paragraphs containing such material 

executive level overview 

trimble’s focus is on combining positioning technology with wireless communication and application capabilities to create systemlevel solutions that enhance productivity and accuracy for our customers the majority of our markets are enduser markets including engineering and construction firms governmental organizations public safety workers farmers and companies who must manage fleets of mobile workers and assets in our advanced devices segment we also provide components to original equipment manufacturers to incorporate into their products in the end user markets we provide a system that includes a hardware platform that may contain software and customer support some examples of our solutions include products that automate and simplify the process of surveying land products that automate the utilization of equipment such as tractors and bulldozers products that enable a company to manage its mobile workforce and assets and products that allow municipalities to manage their fixed assets in addition we also provide software applications on a standalone basis for example we provide software for project management on construction sites 

solutions targeted at the enduser make up a significant majority of our revenue to create compelling products we must attain an understanding of the end users’ needs and work flow and how locationbased technology can enable that end user to work faster more efficiently and more accurately we use this knowledge to create highly innovative products that change the way work is done by the enduser with the exception of our mobile solutions and advanced devices segments our products are generally sold through a dealer channel and it is crucial that we maintain a proficient global thirdparty distribution channel 

we continued to execute our strategy with a series of actions that can be summarized in three categories 

reinforcing our position in existing markets 

we believe these markets provide us with additional substantial potential for substituting our technology for traditional methods we are continuing to develop new products and to strengthen our distribution channels in order to expand our market in our engineering and construction segment we introduced a new portfolio of robotic total stations rts555 rts655 and rts633   for construction layout applications the alltrak™ asset management system which is designed to help contractors manage their construction equipment and tools as well as the new nomad 800x series of rugged handheld computers that offer cellular data transmission digital photography and barcode scanning 

in our field solutions segment we introduced a variable rate application option for our ez guidance 500 systems new ag gps autopilot platform kits for tractors combines and sprayers as well as the new ag 162262 receivers that feature the trimble proprietary transcend positioning technology we also introduced the fieldiq crop input control system that combines input control capabilities into one comprehensive modular system reducing the need for complex calibrations 

in our mobile solutions segment we introduced trimble® performance manager a unique alerting and business intelligence application that allows cost reductions through fewer miles driven and better utilization of fleet vehicles and decreases an organizations carbon footprint we also announced that windstream corporation directsat usa linfox logistics and british gas have selected trimble’s geomanager for their mrm requirements 

in our advanced devices segment we introduced the new solutions that enable continuous mobile positioning and highaccuracy orientation in poor signal environments we also released new versions of our allsport gps and trimble outdoors applications for the android phone all of these products strengthened our competitive position and created new value for the user 

extending our position in new and existing markets through new product categories 

 we are utilizing the strength of the trimble brand in our markets to expand our revenue by bringing new products to new and existing users in our engineering and construction segment we introduced the pcs900 paving control system an automatic 3d screed control system which improves paving productivity and rideability by directly referencing the road design and minimizing asphalt usage in our field solutions segment the acquisition of ntech industries extends our precision agriculture solutions business with the addition of the greenseeker nitrogen application and weedseeker controlled herbicide application systems while the acquisition of ctn data provided the farmworks software solutions for information and farm operations management during the year we also released the ag gps ez office 2010 software suite designed to help farmers easily map and manage field data   in our mobile solutions segment we announced the acquisition of accutest engineering solutions ltd that expanded our vehicle diagnostic capabilities 

bringing existing technology to new markets 

 we continue to reinforce our position in existing markets and position ourselves in newer markets that will serve as important sources of future growth our efforts are focused in africa china india the middleeast and russia during the year we conducted a highly successful user conference in china that had more than 1600 registered attendees we formed a 5050 joint venture beijing kegong trible navigation technology with china aerospace science  industry academy of information technology casicit to develop manufacture and distribute global navigation satellite system gnss receivers and systems based on the chinese compass satellite system we also signed a definitive agreement to form a 5050 joint venture with china railway eryuan engineering group co ltd creec to develop and provide digital railway solutions that address the design construction and maintenance for the china railway industry 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements we consider the accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting policies these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

revenue recognition 

we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists shipment has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer or is uncertain revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 

contracts andor customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement shipping documents and customer acceptance when applicable are used to verify delivery we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis as well as the customer’s payment history 

revenue for orders is not recognized until the product is shipped and title has transferred to the buyer we bear all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods up to that point our shipment terms for us orders and international orders fulfilled from our european distribution center typically provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the carrier named by the buyer at the named place or point if no precise point is indicated by the buyer we may choose within the place or range stipulated where the carrier will take the goods into carrier’s charge other shipment terms may provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the buyer shipping and handling costs are included in the cost of goods sold 

revenue to distributors and resellers is recognized upon shipment assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met distributors and resellers do not typically have a right of return 

revenue from purchased extended warranty and support agreements is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the warrantysupport period 

we present revenue net of sales taxes and any similar assessments 

in instances where the embedded software in our products is more than incidental to the functionality of the hardware we generally recognize revenue once the product has shipped and title has transferred to the buyer assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met the determination as to whether the embedded software is more than incidental to our products requires significant judgment including a consideration of factors such as marketing research and development efforts and any postcustomer contract support pcs relating to the embedded software 

our software arrangements generally consist of a perpetual license fee and pcs we have established vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for our pcs contracts based on renewal rates the remaining value of the software arrangement is allocated to the license fee using the residual method license revenue is primarily recognized when the software has been delivered and fair value has been established for all remaining undelivered elements revenue from pcs is recognized ratably over the term of the pcs agreement 

subscription revenue related to our hosted arrangements is recognized ratably over the contract period under our hosted arrangements the customer typically does not have the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without incurring a significant penalty and it is not feasible for the customer to run the software either on its own hardware or on a thirdparty’s hardware upfront fees related to our hosted solution primarily consist of amounts for the invehicle enabling hardware device and peripherals if any for upfront fees relating to this proprietary hardware where the firmware is more than incidental to the functionality of the hardware we defer the upfront fees at installation and recognize them ratably over the minimum service contract period generally one to five years product costs are also deferred and amortized over such period 

allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns 

our accounts receivable balance net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns reserve was 2023 million as of january 1 2010 as compared with 2043 million as of january 2 2009 the allowance for doubtful accounts was 39 million and 60 million as of january 1 2010 and january 2 2009 respectively we evaluate ongoing collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors such as age of the accounts receivable balances credit quality historical experience and current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us a specific allowance for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 

a reserve for sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates experienced in the ordinary course of business the reserve for sales returns as of january 1 2010 and january 2 2009 was 17 million and 18 million respectively for estimated future returns that were recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established our revenue could be adversely affected 

inventory valuation 

our inventories net balance was 1440 million as of january 1 2010 as compared with 1609 million as of january 2 2009 our inventory allowances as of january 1 2010 were 281 million as compared with 298 million as of january 2 2009 our inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or market adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value if required are made for estimated excess obsolescence or impaired balances factors influencing these adjustments include decline in demand technological changes product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues if actual factors are less favorable than those projected by us additional inventory writedowns may be required 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred tax assets or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized 

relative to uncertain tax positions we only recognize the tax benefit if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

our valuation allowance is primarily attributable to net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize these deferred tax assets and accordingly a valuation allowance has been provided for such amounts beginning in 2009 we adopted the revised accounting guidance for business combinations under which such valuation allowance adjustments associated with an acquisition closing after january 3 2009 and after the measurement period are recorded through income tax expense prior to january 3 2009 these adjustments were required to be recognized by adjusting the purchase price related to the acquisition 

goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination beginning in fiscal 2009 our identifiable intangible assets now include inprocess research and development based on the revised accounting guidance for business combinations intangible assets acquired individually with a group of other assets or in a business combination are recorded at fair value identifiable intangible assets are comprised of distribution channels and distribution rights patents licenses technology acquired backlog trademarks and inprocess research and development identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straightline method reflecting the pattern of economic benefits associated with these assets and have estimated useful lives ranging from one to fifteen years with a weighted average useful life of 64 years goodwill is not subject to amortization but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment applying a fairvalue based test 

impairment of goodwill intangible assets and other longlived assets 

we evaluate goodwill at a minimum on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing a twostep process first impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit’s carrying amount including goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a discounted cash flow approach if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in step two the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill the difference is recognized as an impairment loss 

depreciation and amortization of the intangible assets and other longlived assets is provided using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives reflecting the pattern of economic benefits associated with these assets changes in circumstances such as technological advances changes to our business model or changes in the capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives of intangible assets or other longlived assets differing from initial estimates in those cases where we determine that the useful life of an asset should be revised the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value will be expensed and the residual value is depreciated over its revised remaining useful life these assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable based on their future cash flows the estimated future cash flows are based upon among other things assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows the assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value 

warranty costs 

the liability for product warranties was 147 million as of january 1 2010 as compared with 133 million as of january 2 2009 we accrue for warranty costs as part of cost of sales based on associated material product costs technical support labor costs and costs incurred by third parties performing work on our behalf our expected future cost is primarily estimated based upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment the products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to three years and in some instances up to 55 years 

while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates revisions to the estimated warranty accrual and related costs may be required 

stockbased compensation 

we recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to our employees and directors based on estimated fair values stockbased compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of income for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 includes compensation expense for stock options granted prior to but not yet vested as of december 30 2005 the grant date fair value of these options was estimated using the blackscholes optionspricing model   the grant date fair value for options granted subsequent to december 30 2005 is estimated using a binomial valuation model  the fair value of rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans is estimated using the blackscholes optionpricing model 

the determination of fair value of sharebased payment awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors riskfree interest rates and expected dividends in addition the binomial model incorporates actual optionpricing behavior and changes in volatility over the option’s contractual term 

beginning in fiscal 2006 our expected stock price volatility for stock purchase rights has been based on implied volatilities of traded options on our stock and our expected stock price volatility for stock options is based on a combination of our historical stock price volatility for the period commensurate with the expected life of the stock option and the implied volatility of traded options the use of implied volatilities was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our stock with terms similar to our awards and also upon our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility however because the expected life of our stock options is greater than the terms of our traded options we used a combination of our historical stock price volatility commensurate with the expected life of our stock options and implied volatility of traded options 

we estimated the expected life of the awards based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and postvesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the options and purchase rights the riskfree interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the expected term of the awards 

we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future accordingly our expected dividend yield is zero 

because stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures the stockbased compensation guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 

if factors change and we employ different assumptions to determine the fair value of our sharebased payment awards granted in future periods the compensation expense that we record under it may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period in addition valuation models including the blackscholes and binomial models may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stockbased compensation consequently there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stockbased compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise expiration early termination or forfeiture of those stockbased payments in the future certain stockbased payments such as employee stock options may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements alternatively values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements

we have a 5253 week fiscal year ending on the friday nearest to december 31 which for fiscal 2009 was january 1 2010 fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2007 were both 52week years fiscal 2008 was a 53week year  

revenue 

in fiscal 2009 total revenue decreased by 2030 million or 15 to 113 billion from 133 billion in fiscal 2008 the decrease in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to slower sales in the engineering and construction segment engineering and construction revenue decreased 1631 million or 220 field solutions decreased 90 million or 3 mobile solutions decreased 122 million or 73 and advanced devices decreased 187 million or 156 as compared to fiscal 2008 in fiscal 2009 the revenue decline was primarily due to recessionary conditions in the us and european markets 

although revenue decreased by 15 in fiscal 2009 our revenue in the fourth quarter increased by 94 million or 35 over the corresponding quarter in the prior year 

in fiscal 2008 total revenue increased by 1070 million or 9 to 133 billion from 122 billion in fiscal 2007 the increase in fiscal 2008 was due to stronger performances in the field solutions and mobile solutions segments engineering and construction revenue decreased 16 million or 02 field solutions increased 1001 million or 50 mobile solutions increased 94 million or 6 and advanced devices decreased 09 million or 1 as compared to fiscal 2007 in fiscal 2008 revenue growth was primarily driven by new products a strong agricultural environment as well as the impact of acquisitions partially offset by softness in european and us markets in engineering and construction 

 during fiscal 2009 sales to customers in the united states represented 50 europe represented 23 asia pacific represented 17 and other regions represented 10 of our total revenue during fiscal 2008 sales to customers in the united states represented 49 europe represented 25 asia pacific represented 14 and other regions represented 12 of our total revenue during the 2007 fiscal year sales to customers in the united states represented 50 europe represented 27 asia pacific represented 12 and other regions represented 11 of our total revenue we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue 

 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenue in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 it is possible however that in future periods the failure of one or more large customers to purchase products in quantities anticipated by us may adversely affect the results of operations 

gross margin 

our gross margin varies due to a number of factors including product mix pricing distribution channel used effects of production volumes new product startup costs and foreign currency translations 

in fiscal 2009 our gross margin decreased by 993 million as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to lower revenue gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 488 both in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 the consistency in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions in engineering and construction and improved product mix in field solutions offset by lower revenue as a percentage of fixed costs 

in fiscal 2008 our gross margin increased by 362 million as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to higher revenue gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 488 in fiscal 2008 and 501 in fiscal 2007 the decrease in the gross margin percentage was driven primarily by increased amortization of purchased intangibles and product mix 

 because of potential product mix changes within and among the industry markets market pressures on unit selling prices fluctuations in unit manufacturing costs including increases in component prices and other factors current level gross margin cannot be assured 

operating income 

operating income decreased by 996 million for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 operating income as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2009 was 76 as compared to 140 for fiscal 2008 the decrease in operating income was primarily driven by lower revenue and associated gross margin the decrease in operating income percentage was primarily due by decreased operating expense leverage primarily in engineering and construction due to lower revenue 

although our operating income decreased in fiscal 2009 our operating income in the fourth quarter increased by 22 million as compared to the corresponding quarter in the prior year due to strong expense control 

operating income increased by 72 million for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 operating income as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2008 was 140 as compared to 146 for fiscal 2007 the increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher revenue and associated gross margin the decrease in operating income percentage was primarily due by increased amortization of purchased intangibles product mix and foreign exchange 

results by segment 

to achieve distribution marketing production and technology advantages in our targeted markets we manage our operations in the following four segments engineering and construction field solutions mobile solutions and advanced devices operating income equals net revenue less cost of sales and operating expense excluding general corporate expense amortization of purchased intangible assets inprocess research and development expense for acquisitions completed prior to fiscal 2009 restructuring charges nonoperating income net and income tax provision 

the following table is a breakdown of revenue and operating income by segment for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

 

a reconciliation of our consolidated segment operating income to consolidated income before income taxes follows 

 

engineering and construction 

engineering and construction revenue decreased by 1631 million or 220 while segment operating income decreased by 677 million or 537 for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 the revenue decrease was primarily due to recessionary conditions in the us and european markets operating income decreased as a result of lower revenue partially offset by a reduction in operating expense resulting from our restructuring activities and overall expense control 

engineering and construction revenue decreased by 16 million or 02 while segment operating income decreased by 480 million or 28 for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 the revenue decrease was primarily due to recessionary conditions in the us and european markets partially offset by strength in the rest of world markets operating income decreased as a result of the slight decline in revenue product mix and operating expense associated with acquisitions in the last twelve months 

field solutions 

field solutions revenue decreased by approximately 90 million or 3 while segment operating income decreased by 50 million or 46 for fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 the decrease in revenue was driven primarily by slower sales of agriculture products both in the us and internationally operating income decreased primarily due to lower revenue 

field solutions revenue increased by approximately 1001 million or 50 while segment operating income increased by 486 million or 80 for fiscal year 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 the increase in revenue was driven primarily by strong sales of agriculture products both in the us and internationally operating income increased primarily due to increased revenue as well as improvement in product costs 

mobile solutions 

mobile solutions revenue decreased by 122 million or 73 while segment operating income increased by 30 million or 266 for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 revenue was down primarily due to decrease in ready mix hardware and subscription revenue as well as the impact in the prior year of the recognition of large nonrecurring items operating income increased primarily due to gross margin improvement and a reduction in operating expenses 

mobile solutions revenue increased by 94 million or 6 while segment operating income decreased by 12 million or 9 for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 revenue grew due to increased subscription revenue and a full first quarter of road revenue as compared to a partial first quarter of road revenue in fiscal 2007 operating income decreased primarily due to increased research and development and sales expense for the field service software partially offset by a reduction in operating expenses 

advanced devices 

advanced devices revenue decreased by 187 million or 156 and segment operating income decreased by 72 million or 295 for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 the decrease in revenue was primarily driven by slower sales of component technologies products operating income decreased primarily due to the decrease in revenue partially offset by lower spending due to operating expense control 

advanced devices revenue decreased by 09 million or 1 and segment operating income increased by 72 million or 42 for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 the decrease in revenue was primarily driven by slower sales of component technologies products operating income increased due to product mix royalty and licensing revenue 

research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 

the following table shows research and development “rd” sales and marketing and general and administrative “ga” expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions of those operating expenses below 

 

overall rd sales and marketing and ga expenses decreased by approximately 113 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

research and development expense decreased by 116 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to the impact of a decrease in compensation related expense a decrease in rd materials and a decrease due to foreign currency exchange rates partially offset by new rd expense as a result of acquisitions not applicable in the prior year all of our rd costs have been expensed as incurred overall research and development spending was approximately 12 of revenue in fiscal 2009 and 11 in fiscal 2008 

research and development expense increased by 168 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to the impact of new rd expense as a result of acquisitions not applicable in the prior year an increase in compensation related expense an increase in rd materials and an increase due to foreign currency exchange rates all of our rd costs have been expensed as incurred overall research and development spending remained relatively constant at approximately 11 of revenue 

 we believe that the development and introduction of new products are critical to our future success and we expect to continue active development of new products 

sales and marketing expense decreased by 64 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in travel and trade show expense and a decrease due to foreign currency exchange rates partially offset by new sales and marketing expenses as a result of acquisitions not applicable in the prior year spending overall was approximately 17 of revenue in fiscal 2009 compared to 15 in fiscal 2008 

sales and marketing expense increased by 98 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 the increase was primarily due to new sales and marketing expenses as a result of acquisitions not applicable in the prior year an increase in compensation related expense and an increase in trade shows and marketing literature expense spending overall remained relatively constant at approximately 15 of revenue 

 our future growth will depend in part on the timely development and continued viability of the markets in which we currently compete as well as our ability to continue to identify and develop new markets for our products 

general and administrative expense increased by 68 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to additional ga expenses as a result of acquisitions increased deferred compensation plan liabilities and stock compensation expense partially offset by foreign exchange rates spending overall was at approximately 9 of revenue in fiscal 2009 compared to 7 in fiscal 2008 

general and administrative expense increased by 15 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to new ga expenses as a result of acquisitions partially offset by decreased compensation related expense and reduced deferred compensation liabilities spending overall was at approximately 7 of revenue in fiscal 2008 compared to 8 in fiscal 2007 

other operating expenses 

restructuring expense 

restructuring expense for the three years ended january 1 2010 was as follows 

 

during fiscal 2009 restructuring expense of 108 million was related to decisions to streamline processes and reduce the cost structure of the company with approximately 340 employees affected worldwide of the total restructuring expense 64 million is presented as a separate line within operating expense and 44 million is included within cost of sales on the company’s consolidated statements of income expense related to the decisions made through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 is all accrued as of january 1 2010 

during fiscal 2008 restructuring expense of 46 million was related to decisions to streamline processes and reduce the cost structure of the company with approximately 100 employees affected worldwide of the total restructuring expense 27 million is presented as a separate line within operating expense on the company’s consolidated statements of income and 19 million is included within cost of sales 

during fiscal 2007 restructuring expense of 30 million was for charges associated with the company’s acquisition of road the restructuring expense was related to the acceleration of vesting of employee stock options for certain terminated road employees of which 14 million was settled in cash and 16 million was recorded in shareholders’ equity 

restructuring costs associated with business combinations 

in addition to the restructuring expense in fiscal 2008 costs associated with exiting activities of companies the company acquired in fiscal 2008 were 04 million consisting of severance and benefits costs these costs were recognized as a liability assumed in the purchase business combinations and were included in the allocation of the cost to acquisitions and accordingly resulted in an increase to goodwill rather than an expense in fiscal 2008 

there were 11 million of adjustments that decreased the restructuring liability during fiscal 2008 and 02 million of adjustments that increased the restructuring liability during fiscal 2009 the 2008 adjustments related to differences between original estimates and actual payouts for severance and benefits 09 million of which related to the road acquisition 

restructuring liability 

the following table summarizes the restructuring activity for 2008 and 2009 in thousands 

 

as of january 1 2010 the 26 million restructuring accrual consists of severance and benefits of the 26 million restructuring accrual 21 million is included in other current liabilities and is expected to be settled by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 the remaining balance of 05 million is included in other noncurrent liabilities and is expected to be settled by the first quarter of fiscal 2011 

inprocess research and development 

during fiscal 2009 the company adopted the fasb’s revised accounting guidance on business combinations which requires the estimated fair value of inprocess research and development iprd acquired to be capitalized as an intangible asset until the project is complete at which point the asset is amortized over its estimated useful life or writtenoff if abandoned there was no iprd capitalized in 2009 prior to 2009 iprd was expensed in fiscal 2008 there was no iprd expense and in fiscal 2007 company recorded iprd expense of 21 million related to the road acquisition 

amortization of purchased and other intangible assets 

 

total amortization expense of purchased and other intangible assets was 527 million in fiscal 2009 of which 223 million was recorded in cost of sales and 303 million was recorded in operating expense total amortization expense of purchased and other intangibles represented 47 of revenue in fiscal 2009 an increase of 76 million from fiscal 2008 when it represented 34 of revenue the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of certain technology and patent intangibles as a result of acquisitions made in fiscal 2009 as well as fiscal 2008 acquisition intangibles that included a full year impact of amortization expense in fiscal 2009 

total amortization expense of purchased and other intangible assets was 451 million in fiscal 2008 of which 227 million was recorded in cost of sales and 224 million was recorded in operating expense total amortization expense of purchased and other intangibles represented 34 of revenue in fiscal 2008 an increase of 63 million from fiscal 2007 when it represented 32 of revenue the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of certain technology and patent intangibles as a result of acquisitions made in fiscal 2008 as well as fiscal 2007 acquisition intangibles that included a full year impact of amortization expense in fiscal 2008 

nonoperating income net 

the following table shows nonoperating income net for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions of those expenses below 

 

total nonoperating income net decreased by 42 million during fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 the decrease was due to lower income from joint ventures and lower foreign exchange gains partially offset by gains on assets in our deferred compensation plan 

total nonoperating income net increased by 05 million during fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 the increase was due to lower interest expense due to lower average outstanding debt balances and interest rates fluctuations in foreign currencies largely offset by a decrease in interest income and losses on assets in our deferred compensation plan 

income tax provision 

our effective income tax rate for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 was 27 26 and 36 respectively the 2009 rate was less than the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the implementation of a global supply chain management structure since 2007 we have licensed our us intellectual property to a foreign affiliated legal entity and implemented a global supply chain management structure which streamlined our worldwide operations we believe that the licensing of intellectual property was effected for consideration that was equivalent to armslength negotiated pricing this resulted beginning in 2008 in a tax benefit due to a lower foreign tax rate the company’s policy is to indefinitely reinvest a portion of its undistributed foreign subsidiaries’ earnings and accordingly no related provision for us federal and state income taxes has been provided for these earnings the 2007 rate was different from the us federal statutory rate of 35 due to the impact of stockbased compensation and state tax expense reduced by the impact of federal and california research credit 

litigation matters 

 from time to time we are involved in litigation arising out of the ordinary course of our business there are no known claims or pending litigation that are expected to have a material effect on our overall financial position results of operations or liquidity 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than lease commitments incurred in the normal course of business see contractual obligations table below we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities guarantee contracts retained or contingent interests in transferred assets or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity we do not have any majorityowned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements additionally we do not have any interest in or relationship with any special purpose entities 

in the normal course of business to facilitate sales of its products we indemnify other parties including customers lessors and parties to other transactions with us with respect to certain matters we have agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties these agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents 

it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under these agreements were not material and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on the consolidated balance sheets as of january 1 2010 and january 2 2009 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

cash and cash equivalents 

as of january 1 2010 cash and cash equivalents totaled 2738 million compared to 1425 million at january 2 2009 we had debt of 1515 million at january 1 2010 compared to 1516 million at january 2 2009 

 our ability to continue to generate cash from operations will depend in large part on profitability the rate of collections of accounts receivable our inventory turns and our ability to manage other areas of working capital 

 we believe that our cash and cash equivalents together with our revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs and stock purchases under the stock repurchase program for at least the next twelve months 

 we anticipate that planned capital expenditures primarily for computer equipment software manufacturing tools and test equipment and leasehold improvements associated with business expansion will constitute a partial use of our cash resources decisions related to how much cash is used for investing are influenced by the expected amount of cash to be provided by operations 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 1946 million for fiscal 2009 as compared to 1761 million for fiscal 2008 the increase of 186 million was due to a decrease in inventories and an increase in accounts payable accrued compensation and benefits and deferred revenue  partially offset by a decrease in net income before noncash depreciation and amortization and an increase in accounts receivable 

cash provided by operating activities was 1761 million for fiscal 2008 as compared to 1870 million for fiscal 2007 this decrease of 109 million was due to a decrease in accounts payable deferred revenue income taxes payable and accrued compensation and benefits  partially offset by an increase in net income before noncash depreciation and amortization and a decrease in accounts receivable 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 839 million for fiscal 2009 as compared to 1267 million for fiscal 2008 the decrease was primarily due to less cash used for acquisitions in fiscal 2009 

cash used in investing activities was 1267 million for fiscal 2008 as compared to 3114 million for fiscal 2007 the decrease was due to cash used for acquisitions attributable primarily to road which was acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 

financing activities 

cash provided by financing activities was 161 million for fiscal 2009 as compared to cash used of 64 million during fiscal 2008 the increase of 226 million was primarily due to prior year stock repurchase activities partially offset by prior year increase in debt 

cash used in financing activities was 64 million for fiscal 2008 as compared to cash provided of 1038 million during fiscal 2007 primarily due to stock repurchase activities partially offset by net cash borrowed from our credit facilities 

accounts receivable and inventory metrics 

 

 

accounts receivable days sales outstanding were down slightly at 66 days as of january 1 2010 as compared to 69 days as of january 2 2009 our accounts receivable days sales outstanding are calculated based on ending accounts receivable net divided by revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter times a quarterly average of 91 days our inventory turns were at 34 for fiscal 2009 as compared to 42 for fiscal 2008 our inventory turnover is based on the total cost of sales for the fiscal period over the average inventory for the corresponding fiscal period 

debt 

at the end of fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 our total debt was comprised primarily of our revolving credit line in the amount of 1510 million as of january 1 2010 and january 2 2009 there were also notes payable totaling approximately 483000 and 588000 respectively consisting primarily of government loans to foreign subsidiaries 

on july 28 2005 we entered into a 200 million unsecured revolving credit agreement the 2005 credit facility with a syndicate of 10 banks with the bank of nova scotia as the administrative agent on february 16 2007 we amended our existing 200 million unsecured revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of 11 banks with the bank of nova scotia as the administrative agent the 2007 credit facility under the 2007 credit facility we exercised the option in the existing credit agreement to increase the availability under the revolving credit line by 100 million for an aggregate availability of up to 300 million and extended the maturity date of the revolving credit line by 18 months from july 2010 to february 2012 up to 25 million of the availability under the revolving credit line may be used to issue letters of credit and up to 20 million may be used for paying off other debts or loans the maximum leverage ratio under the 2007 credit facility is 300100 the funds available under the new 2007 credit facility may be used by us for acquisitions stock repurchases and general corporate purposes as of august 20 2008 we amended the 2007 credit facility to allow us to redeem retire or purchase trimble common stock without limitation so long as no default or unmatured default then existed and leverage ratio for the two most recently completed periods was less than 200100 in addition the definition of the fixed charge was amended to exclude the impact of redemptions retirements or purchases of trimble common stock from the fixed charges coverage ratio for additional discussion of our debt see note 9 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

in addition during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 we incurred a fiveyear term loan under the 2007 credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 100 million which was repaid in full during fiscal 2008 

we may borrow funds under the 2007 credit facility in us dollars or in certain other currencies and borrowings will bear interest at our option at either i a base rate based on the administrative agents prime rate plus a margin of between 0 and 0125 depending on our leverage ratio as of our most recently ended fiscal quarter or ii a reserveadjusted rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor euro interbank offered rate euribor stockholm interbank offered rate stibor or other agreedupon rate depending on the currency borrowed plus a margin of between 0625 and 1125 depending on our leverage ratio as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter our obligations under the 2007 credit facility are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries 

the 2007 credit facility contains customary affirmative negative and financial covenants including among other requirements negative covenants that restrict our ability to dispose of assets create liens incur indebtedness repurchase stock pay dividends make acquisitions make investments enter into mergers and consolidations and make capital expenditures within certain limitations and financial covenants that require the maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios the 2007 credit facility contains events of default that include among others nonpayment of principal interest or fees breach of covenants inaccuracy of representations and warranties cross defaults to certain other indebtedness bankruptcy and insolvency events material judgments and events constituting a change of control upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default interest on the obligations will accrue at an increased rate and the lenders may accelerate our obligations under the 2007 credit facility however that acceleration will be automatic in the case of bankruptcy and insolvency events of default as of january 1 2010 we were in compliance with all financial debt covenants 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at january 1 2010 

 

1 we may borrow funds under the 2007 credit facility in us dollars or in certain other currencies and will bear interest as described under note 9 of notes to the consolidated financial statements our obligations under the 2007 credit facility are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries we estimate the interest to be 09  per annum based upon a historical average 

total debt consists of a revolving credit line of 1510 million under our credit facilities and 05 million primarily of government loans to foreign subsidiaries see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further financial information regarding longterm debt 

other purchase obligations and commitments represent open noncancelable purchase orders for material purchases with our vendors purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty our pension obligation which is not included in the table above is included in “other current liabilities” and “other noncurrent liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets additionally as of january 1 2010 we had acquisition earnouts of 22 million and holdbacks of 197 million recorded in “other current liabilities” and “other noncurrent liabilities” the maximum remaining payments which are not included in the table above including the 22 million and 197 million recorded will not exceed 466 million the remaining earnouts and holdbacks are payable through 2012 

as of january 1 2010 we had unrecognized tax benefits included in other noncurrent liabilities of 370 million including interest and penalties at this time we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with tax authorities regarding this liability and therefore such amounts are not included in the contractual obligations table above 

effect of new accounting pronouncements 

the impact of recent accounting pronouncements is disclosed in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors 

market interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds treasury bills commercial paper fdic insured interest and noninterest bearing bank deposits as well as bank time deposits for fiscal 2008 the main objective of these instruments was safety of principal and liquidity while maximizing return without significantly increasing risk 

 due to the shortterm nature of our cash equivalents we do not anticipate any material effect on our portfolio due to fluctuations in interest rates 

we are exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing interest rates under our senior secured credit facilities our credit facility is comprised of an unsecured revolving credit agreement with a maturity date of february 2012 we may borrow funds under the revolving credit agreement in us dollars or in certain other currencies and borrowings will bear interest as described under note 9 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

as of january 1 2010 we had an outstanding balance on the revolving credit line of 1510 million and during fiscal 2009 we repaid the remaining outstanding principal balance on our term loan a hypothetical 10 increase in the threemonth libor rates could result in approximately 38000 annual increase in interest expense on the existing principal balances 

 the hypothetical changes and assumptions made above will be different from what actually occurs in the future furthermore the computations do not anticipate actions that may be taken by our management should the hypothetical market changes actually occur over time as a result actual earnings effects in the future will differ from those quantified above 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on cash certain trade and intercompany receivables and payables primarily denominated in australian canadian and new zealand dollars japanese yen indian rupee south african rand swedish krona euro and british pound these contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements as the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses on the forward contracts these instruments are marked to market through earnings every period and generally range from one to three months in original maturity we do not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for trading purposes 

foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of january 1 2010 and january 2 2009 are summarized as follows in thousands 

 

 we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position utilizing our current hedging strategy

we began operations in 1978 and incorporated in california in 1981 our common stock has been publicly traded on nasdaq since 1990 under the symbol trmb 

on january 17 2007 our board of directors approved a 2for1 split of all outstanding shares of the company’s common stock payable february 22 2007 to stockholders of record on february 8 2007 all shares and per share information presented have been adjusted to reflect the stock split on a retroactive basis for all periods presented 

technology overview 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from applying global navigation satellite system or gnss technology to terrestrial applications the gnss includes the network of 24 orbiting us global positioning system or gps radio navigation satellites and associated ground control that is funded and maintained by the us government and is available worldwide free of direct user fees and the russian glonass radio navigation satellite system both the european community and china have announced plans to establish future operational radio navigation satellite systems gnss positioning is based on a technique that precisely measures distances from four or more satellites the satellites continuously transmit precisely timed radio signals using extremely accurate atomic clocks a gnss receiver measures distances from the satellites in view by determining the travel time of a signal from the satellite to the receiver and then uses those distances to compute its position under normal circumstances a standalone gnss receiver is able to calculate its position at any point on earth in the earths atmosphere or in lower earth orbit to approximately 10 meters 24 hours a day much better accuracies are possible through a technique called “differential gnss” in addition to providing position gnss provides extremely accurate time measurement 

gnss accuracy is dependent upon the locations of the receiver and the number of gnss satellites that are above the horizon at any given time reception of gnss signals requires lineofsight visibility between the satellites and the receiver which can be blocked by buildings hills and dense foliage the receiver must have a line of sight to at least four satellites to determine its latitude longitude and time the accuracy of gnss may also be limited by distortion of gnss signals from ionospheric and other atmospheric conditions 

our gnss products are based on proprietary receiver technology over time the advances in positioning wireless communications and information technologies have enabled us to add more capability to our products and thereby deliver more value to our users for example the developments in wireless technology and deployments of next generation wireless networks have enabled less expensive wireless communications these developments provide the efficient transfer of position data to locations away from the positioning field device allowing the data to be accessed by more users thereby increasing productivity this allows us to integrate visualization and design software into some of our systems as well as offer positioning services all of which make our customers more efficient at what they do 

our laser and optical products either measure distances and angles to provide a position in three dimensional space or are used as highly accurate laser references from which a position can be established the key elements of these products are typically a laser which is generally a commercially available laser diode and a complex mechanical assembly these elements are augmented by software algorithms to provide measurements and applicationspecific solutions 

business strategy 

 

our business strategy is developed around an analysis of several key elements 

 

 

 

 

business segments and markets 

we are organized into four reporting segments encompassing our various applications and product lines engineering and construction field solutions mobile solutions and advanced devices our segments are distinguished by the markets they serve each segment consists of businesses which are responsible for product development marketing sales strategy and financial performance

 item 1a risk factors 

risks and uncertainties 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k and in any other documents to which we refer you in this form 10k before purchasing our securities the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 

current economic conditions and the global financial crisis may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict 

 

the company’s operations and performance depend on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of business spending which have deteriorated significantly in many countries and regions and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future uncertainties in the financial and credit markets have caused our customers to postpone purchases and continued uncertainties may reduce future sales of our products and services continued adverse economic conditions are likely to depress tax revenue of federal state and local government entities which are significant purchasers of the company’s products protectionist trade measures that may be adopted in response to the economic downturn could reduce demand for our products and services overseas with the exception of our mobile solutions and advanced devices segments our products are generally sold through a dealer channel and our dealers depend on the availability of credit to finance purchases of our products for their inventory 

customer collections are our primary source of cash while we believe we have a strong customer base and have experienced strong collections in the past if the current market conditions continue to deteriorate we may experience increased collection times or greater writeoffs which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow in addition the companys results may be adversely affected if the company is unable to market manufacture and ship new products any writeoff of goodwill could also negatively impact our financial results finally our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like or need to do so which could have an impact on our flexibility to pursue additional expansion opportunities and maintain our desired level of revenue growth in the future these and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for the company’s products and services and on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

our inability to accurately predict orders and shipments may subject our results of operations to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter 

we have not been able in the past to consistently predict when our customers will place orders and request shipments so that we cannot always accurately plan our manufacturing requirements as a result if orders and shipments differ from what we predict we may incur additional expense and build excess inventory which may require additional reserves and allowances accordingly we have limited visibility into future changes in demand and our results of operations may be subject to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter 

our operating results in each quarter may be affected by special conditions such as seasonality late quarter purchases weather and other potential issues 

due in part to the buying patterns of our customers a significant portion of our quarterly revenue occurs from orders received and immediately shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of each quarter although our operating expense tends to remain fairly predictable engineering and construction purchases tend to occur in early spring and governmental agencies tend to utilize funds available at the end of the government’s fiscal year for additional purchases at the end of our third fiscal quarter in september of each year concentrations of orders sometimes also occur at the end of our other two fiscal quarters additionally a majority of our sales force earns commissions on a quarterly basis which may cause concentrations of orders at the end of any fiscal quarter it could harm our operating results if for any reason expected sales are deferred orders are not received or shipments are delayed a few days at the end of a quarter 

we are dependent on a specific manufacturer and assembler for many of our products and on specific suppliers of critical parts for our products 

we are substantially dependent upon flextronics international limited as our preferred manufacturing partner for many of our gps products under the agreement we provide to flextronics a twelvemonth product forecast and place purchase orders with flextronics at least thirty calendar days in advance of the scheduled delivery of products to our customers depending on production lead time although purchase orders placed with flextronics are cancelable the terms of the agreement would require us to purchase from flextronics all inventory not returnable or usable by other flextronics customers accordingly if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products we may be unable to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity from flextronics to meet customers’ delivery requirements or we may accumulate excess inventories if such inventories are not usable by other flextronics customers our current contract with flextronics continues in effect until either party gives the other ninety days written notice  

in addition we rely on specific suppliers for a number of our critical components we have experienced shortages of components in the past our current reliance on specific or a limited group of suppliers involves several risks including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components reduced control over pricing and economic conditions which may adversely impact the viability of our suppliers any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture such components internally could significantly delay our ability to ship our products which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our reputation and brand as well as our operating results 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate which could negatively impact our operations and our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control results in any period could be affected by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition demand for our products in any quarter or year may vary due to the seasonal buying patterns of our customers in the agricultural and engineering and construction industries the price of our common stock could decline substantially in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors which are based primarily on historical models that are not necessarily accurate representations of the future 

our gross margin is subject to fluctuation 

our gross margin is affected by a number of factors including product mix product pricing cost of components foreign currency exchange rates and manufacturing costs for example sales of nikonbranded products generally have lower gross margin as compared to our gps survey products absent other factors a shift in sales towards nikonbranded products would lead to a reduction in our overall gross margin a decline in gross margin could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

we are dependent on new products and if we are unable to successfully introduce them into the market our customer base may decline or fail to grow as anticipated 

our future revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to bring new products to market on a timely basis we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance of such products we may incur problems in the future in innovating and introducing new products our development stage products may not be successfully completed or if developed may not achieve significant customer acceptance if we were unable to successfully define develop and introduce competitive new products and enhance existing products our future results of operations would be adversely affected development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and we might not achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success if we are unable to introduce new products if other companies develop similar technology products or if we do not develop compelling new products our number of customers may not grow as anticipated or may decline which could harm our operating results 

we are dependent on proprietary technology which could result in litigation that could divert significant valuable resources 

our future success and competitive position is dependent upon our proprietary technology and we rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright law to protect our intellectual property the patents owned or licensed by us may be invalidated circumvented and challenged the rights granted under these patents may not provide competitive advantages to us any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us if at all 

others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology duplicate our technology or design around the patents owned by us in addition effective copyright patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in certain countries the steps taken by us to protect our technology might not prevent the misappropriation of such technology 

the value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many current patent filings we recognize that as new patents are issued or are brought to our attention by the holders of such patents it may be necessary for us to withdraw products from the market take a license from such patent holders or redesign our products we do not believe any of our products currently infringe patents or other proprietary rights of third parties but we cannot be certain they do not do so in addition the legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant expense of operations any such litigation could require us to incur substantial costs and divert significant valuable resources including the efforts of our technical and management personnel which harm our results of operations and financial condition 

investing in and integrating new acquisitions could be costly and may place a significant strain on our management systems and resources which could negatively impact our operating results 

we have recently acquired a number of companies and intend to continue to acquire other companies acquisitions of companies entail numerous risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a result of such acquisitions we have significant assets that include goodwill and other purchased intangibles the testing of this goodwill and intangibles for impairment under established accounting guidelines requires significant use of judgment and assumptions changes in business conditions could require adjustments to the valuation of these assets in addition losses incurred by a company in which we have an investment may have a direct impact on our financial statements or could result in our having to writedown the value of such investment any such problems in integration or adjustments to the value of the assets acquired could harm our growth strategy and could be costly and place a significant strain on our management systems and resources 

our products may contain errors or defects which could result in damage to our reputation lost revenue diverted development resources and increased service costs warranty claims and litigation 

 

we warrant that our products will be free of defect for various periods of time depending on the product in addition certain of our contracts include epidemic failure clauses if invoked these clauses may entitle the customer to return or obtain credits for products and inventory or to cancel outstanding purchase orders even if the products themselves are not defective 

we must develop our products quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing market and we have a history of frequently introducing new products products and services as sophisticated as ours could contain undetected errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new models or versions are released in general our products may not be free from errors or defects after commercial shipments have begun which could result in damage to our reputation lost revenue diverted development resources increased customer service and support costs and warranty claims and litigation 

we are dependent on the availability of allocated bands within the radio frequency spectrum 

our gnss technology is dependent on the use of satellite signals from space and on terrestrial communication bands international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union itu a specialized technical agency of the united nations these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used 

any itu or local reallocation of radio frequency bands including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products many of our products use other radio frequency bands together with the gnss signal to provide enhanced gnss capabilities such as realtime kinematics precision the continuing availability of these nongnss radio frequencies is essential to provide enhanced gnss products to our precision survey agriculture and construction machine controls markets any regulatory changes in spectrum allocation or in allowable operating conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have certain products such as gps rtk systems and surveying and mapping systems that use integrated radio communication technology requiring access to available radio frequencies allocated to local government some bands are experiencing congestion in the us the fcc announced that it will require migration of radio technology from wideband to narrowband operations in these bands the rules require migration of users to narrowband channels by 2011 in the meantime congestion could cause fcc coordinators to restrict or refuse licenses an inability to obtain access to these radio frequencies by end users could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

many of our products rely on gnss technology the gps and other satellite systems which may become inoperable and result in lost revenue 

gnss technology gps satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage many of the gps satellites currently in orbit were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of 30 satellites in place some have already been in operation for more than 12 years to repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites a reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities 

as the only complete gnss currently in operation we are dependent on continued operation of gps gps is operated by the u s government which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps however if the policy were to change and gps were no longer supported by the u s government or if user fees were imposed it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

many of our products also use signals from systems that augment gps such as the wide area augmentation system waas and national differential gps system ndgps many of these augmentation systems are operated by the federal government and rely on continued funding and maintenance of these systems in addition some of our products also use satellite signals from the russian glonass system any curtailment of the operating capability of these systems could result in decreased user capability thereby impacting our markets 

the european community has begun development of an independent radio navigation satellite system known as galileo we have access to the preliminary signal design which is subject to change and which requires a commercial license from galileo authorities although an operational galileo system is several years away if we are unable to develop a timely commercial product or obtain a timely commercial license it could result in lost revenue which could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war or terrorism 

acts of war or acts of terrorism especially any directed at the gps signals could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may invoke a redeployment of the satellites used in gps or interruptions of the system to the extent that such interruptions result in delays or cancellations of orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and although we hedge against these risks our attempts to hedge could be unsuccessful and expose us to losses 

a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the us and as such we face exposure to movements in nonus currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows fluctuation in currency impacts our operating results 

currently we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities our attempts to hedge against these risks could be unsuccessful and expose us to losses 

our debt could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations 

we have an existing unsecured revolving credit agreement under which we have an ability to borrow an aggregate amount of up to 300 million as of january 2 2009 1510 million was outstanding under this line of credit debt incurred under this agreement could have important consequences such as 

 

 

 

 

additionally if we were to default under our amended credit agreement and were unable to obtain a waiver for such a default interest on the obligations would accrue at an increased rate and the lenders could accelerate our obligations under the amended credit agreement however that acceleration will be automatic in the case of bankruptcy and insolvency events of default additionally our subsidiaries that have guaranteed the amended credit agreement could be required to pay the full amount of our obligations under the amended credit agreement any such action on the part of the lenders against us could harm our financial condition 

we may not be able to enter into or maintain important alliances 

we believe that in certain business opportunities our success will depend on our ability to form and maintain alliances with industry participants such as caterpillar nikon and cnh global our failure to form and maintain such alliances or the preemption of such alliances by actions of competitors or us will adversely affect our ability to penetrate emerging markets if we experience problems from current or future alliances it could harm our operating results and we may not be able to realize value from any such strategic alliances 

we face competition in our markets which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition 

our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price quality and performance of our products the level of customer service the development of new technology and our ability to participate in emerging markets within each of our markets we encounter direct competition from other gps optical and laser suppliers and competition may intensify from various larger us and nonus competitors and new market entrants particularly from emerging markets such as china and india the competition in the future may in some cases result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the future against existing and additional competitors will depend largely on our ability to execute our strategy to provide systems and products with significantly differentiated features compared to currently available products we may not be able to implement this strategy successfully and our products may not be competitive with other technologies or products that may be developed by our competitors many of whom have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing sales and other resources than we do 

we are subject to the impact of governmental and other similar certifications and failure to obtain the requisite certifications could harm our operating results 

we market certain products that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold for example ce certification for radiated emissions is required for most gps receiver and data communications products sold in the european community an inability to obtain such certifications in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our operating results also some of our products that use integrated radio communication technology require product type certification and some products require an end user to obtain licensing from the fcc for frequencyband usage these are secondary licenses that are subject to certain restrictions an inability or delay in obtaining such certifications or changes to the rules by the fcc could adversely affect our ability to bring our products to market which could harm our customer relationships and therefore our operating results any failure to obtain the requisite certifications could also harm our operating results 

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect your investment in our common stock 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile during fiscal 2008 our stock price ranged from 1443 to 4142 on a postsplit basis we believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate perhaps substantially including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of hightech companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the market price of our common stock may decline 

changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income in future periods 

a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the company is currently in various stages of multiple year examinations by federal state and foreign taxing authorities including an audit of its 2005 through 2007 tax years by the us internal revenue service irs if the irs or the taxing authorities of any other jurisdiction were to successfully challenge a material tax position we could become subject to higher taxes and our earnings would be adversely affected in addition proposals for changes in us tax laws that may be considered or adopted in the future could subject the company to higher taxes or result in changes to tax law provisions that currently provide favorable tax treatment

executive level overview 

trimble’s focus is on combining positioning technology with wireless communication and application capabilities to create systemlevel solutions that enhance productivity and accuracy for our customers the majority of our markets are enduser markets including engineering and construction firms governmental organizations public safety workers farmers and companies who must manage fleets of mobile workers and assets in our advanced devices segment we also provide components to original equipment manufacturers to incorporate into their products in the end user markets we provide a system that includes a hardware platform that may contain software and customer support some examples of our solutions include products that automate and simplify the process of surveying land products that automate the utilization of equipment such as tractors and bulldozers products that enable a company to manage its mobile workforce and assets and products that allow municipalities to manage their fixed assets in addition we also provide software applications on a standalone basis for example we provide software for project management on construction sites 

solutions targeted at the enduser make up a significant majority of our revenue to create compelling products we must attain an understanding of the end users’ needs and work flow and how locationbased technology can enable that end user to work faster more efficiently and more accurately we use this knowledge to create highly innovative products that change the way work is done by the enduser with the exception of our mobile solutions and advanced devices segments our products are generally sold through a dealer channel and it is crucial that we maintain a proficient global thirdparty distribution channel 

we continued to execute our strategy with a series of actions that can be summarized in four categories 

reinforcing our position in existing markets 

 we believe these markets provide us with additional substantial potential for substituting our technology for traditional methods we are continuing to develop new products and to strengthen our distribution channels in order to expand our market opportunity in our field solutions segment we introduced the ag gps ezguide 250 lightbar guidance system gps pathfinder proxrt receiver trimble geoexplorer 2008 series and the new juno™ series we announced that the city of joliet illinois public utilities department and the baton rouge water company in louisiana selected trimble’s fieldport software to enhance utility field operations in our engineering and construction segment we introduced the trimble mep layout solution trimble coastal center™ software and trimble netr8™ gnss reference receiver we also introduced further enhancements to our complete surveying portfolio as part of its connected site™ solutions new models of the trimble s8 total station with options for monitoring and tunneling applications a new version of trimble business center a scalable trimble vx spatial station and improved field to office solutions for german surveyors in our mobile solutions segment we announced that carrier corporation is rolling out trimbles mobile resource management mrm solution within its fleet all of these products strengthened our competitive position and created new value for the user 

 

extending our position in existing markets through new product categories 

 we are utilizing the strength of the trimble brand in our markets to expand our revenue by bringing new products to existing users in our field solutions segment we introduced agriculture manager™ asset management system aggps ezoffice™ software in our engineering and construction segment we introduced new products such as a new sensor for the trimble ccs900 compaction control system that provides realtime material density information to earthworks operators we were also chosen to supply trimble vrs™ technology to establish a nationwide gnss infrastructure network for turkey called corstr continuous operating reference stationturkey or tusaga aktif and the republic of croatia called the croatian positioning system cropos we launched trimble vrs now™ service in madrid spain and in the state of florida to provide surveyors civil engineers and geospatial professionals in the area with instant access to realtime kinematic rtk gnss corrections without the need for a base station these are all examples of bringing new products to existing markets 

 

bringing existing technology to new markets 

 we continue to reinforce our position in existing markets and position ourselves in newer markets that will serve as important sources of future growth our efforts in africa china india the middleeast and russia reflected improving financial results we announced a gps software technology licensing agreement with marvell a leader in the development of storage communications and consumer silicon the licensing agreement will enable marvell to provide customers with comprehensive gps solutions based on innovative architectures that are tailored for high performance and low overall system power consumption 

entering new market segments 

 during 2008 we acquired companies technologies or introduced new product categories that have allowed us to enter new market segments in our engineering and construction segment we acquired two accessory companies crain and seco whose products complement our existing construction product offerings additionally we acquired three companies géo3d rolleimetric and toposys which through new product offerings expand the emerging geospatial markets in our field solutions segment we acquired trucount and rawson control systems which through new products expand our agricultural market segment we also acquired the fastmap and geosite software assets from korec which expand our gis solutions 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements we consider the accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting polices these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

revenue recognition 

we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists shipment has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer or is uncertain revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 

contracts andor customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement shipping documents and customer acceptance when applicable are used to verify delivery we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis as well as the customer’s payment history 

revenue for orders is not recognized until the product is shipped and title has transferred to the buyer we bear all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods up to that point our shipment terms for us orders and international orders fulfilled from our european distribution center typically provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the carrier named by the buyer at the named place or point if no precise point is indicated by the buyer we may choose within the place or range stipulated where the carrier will take the goods into carrier’s charge other shipment terms may provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the buyer shipping and handling costs are included in the cost of goods sold 

revenue to distributors and resellers is recognized upon shipment assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met distributors and resellers do not have a right of return 

revenue from purchased extended warranty and support agreements is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the warrantysupport period 

we present revenue net of sales taxes and any similar assessments 

we apply statement of position sop no 972 “software revenue recognition” to products where the embedded software is more than incidental to the functionality of the hardware this determination requires significant judgment including a consideration of factors such as marketing research and development efforts and any postcustomer contract support pcs relating to the embedded software 

our software arrangements generally consist of a perpetual license fee and pcs we have established vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for our pcs contracts based on renewal rates the remaining value of the software arrangement is allocated to the license fee using the residual method license revenue is primarily recognized when the software has been delivered and there are no remaining obligations revenue from pcs is recognized ratably over the term of the pcs agreement 

we apply eitf issue 003 application of aicpa statement of position 972 to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entitys hardware for hosted arrangements which the customer does not have the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without incurring a significant penalty and it is not feasible for the customer to run the software either on its own hardware or on a thirdparty’s hardware subscription revenue related to our hosted arrangements is recognized ratably over the contract period upfront fees for our hosted solution primarily consist of amounts for the invehicle enabling hardware device and peripherals if any for upfront fees relating to proprietary hardware where the firmware is more than incidental to the functionality of the hardware in accordance with sop no 972 “software revenue recognition” we defer the upfront fees at installation and recognize them ratably over the minimum service contract period generally one to five years product costs are also deferred and amortized over such period 

in accordance with eitf issue 0021 “accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” when a nonsoftware sale involves multiple elements the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each element is met 

allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns 

our accounts receivable balance net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns reserve was 2043 million as of january 2 2009 as compared with 2399 million as of december 28 2007 the allowance for doubtful accounts was 60 million and 52 million as of january 2 2009 and december 28 2007 respectively we evaluate ongoing collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors such as age of the accounts receivable balances credit quality historical experience and current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us a specific allowance for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 

a reserve for sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates experienced in the ordinary course of business the reserve for sales returns as of january 2 2009 and december 28 2007 was 18 million and 17 million respectively for estimated future returns that were recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established our revenue could be adversely affected 

inventory valuation 

our inventories net balance was 1609 million as of january 2 2009 as compared with 1430 million as of december 28 2007 our inventory allowances as of january 2 2009 were 298 million as compared with 296 million as of december 28 2007 our inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or market adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value if required are made for estimated excess obsolescence or impaired balances factors influencing these adjustments include decline in demand technological changes product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues if actual factors are less favorable than those projected by us additional inventory writedowns may be required 

income taxes 

 

income taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred tax assets or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized 

our valuation allowance is attributable to primarily acquisition related net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize these deferred tax assets and accordingly a valuation allowance has been provided for such amounts when sfas 141r “business combinations” becomes effective any valuation allowance adjustment associated with an acquisition that closed prior to january 3 2009 and after the measurement period will be recorded through income tax expense whereas the current accounting treatment under sfas 141 would require any adjustment to be recognized through the purchase price 

goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible identifiable intangible assets and inprocess research and development acquired in a business combination intangible assets acquired individually with a group of other assets or in a business combination are recorded at fair value identifiable intangible assets are comprised of distribution channels and distribution rights patents licenses technology acquired backlog and trademarks identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straightline method reflecting the pattern of economic benefits associated with these assets and have estimated useful lives ranging from one to twelve years with a weighted average useful life of 65 years goodwill is not subject to amortization but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment applying a fairvalue based test 

 

impairment of goodwill intangible assets and other longlived assets 

we evaluate goodwill at a minimum on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing a twostep process first impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit’s carrying amount including goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a discounted cash flow approach if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in step two the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill the difference is recognized as an impairment loss 

depreciation and amortization of the intangible assets and other longlived assets is provided using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives reflecting the pattern of economic benefits associated with these assets changes in circumstances such as technological advances changes to our business model or changes in the capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives of intangible assets or other longlived assets differing from initial estimates in those cases where we determine that the useful life of an asset should be revised the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value will be expensed and the residual value is depreciated over its revised remaining useful life these assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable based on their future cash flows the estimated future cash flows are based upon among other things assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows the assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value 

warranty costs 

the liability for product warranties was 133 million as of january 2 2009 as compared with 108 million as of december 28 2007 we accrue for warranty costs as part of cost of sales based on associated material product costs technical support labor costs and costs incurred by third parties performing work on our behalf our expected future cost is primarily estimated based upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment the products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to three years and in some instances up to 55 years 

while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates revisions to the estimated warranty accrual and related costs may be required 

stockbased compensation 

beginning in fiscal 2006 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” sfas 123r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to our employees and directors based on estimated fair values stockbased compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of income for fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 includes compensation expense for awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of december 30 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated using the blackscholes optionspricing model in accordance with the provisions of sfas 123 and compensation expense for awards granted subsequent to december 30 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated using a binomial valuation model in accordance with the provisions of sfas 123r the fair value of rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans was estimated using the blackscholes optionpricing model 

the determination of fair value of sharebased payment awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors riskfree interest rates and expected dividends in addition the binomial model incorporates actual optionpricing behavior and changes in volatility over the option’s contractual term 

beginning in fiscal 2006 our expected stock price volatility for stock purchase rights has been based on implied volatilities of traded options on our stock and our expected stock price volatility for stock options is based on a combination of our historical stock price volatility for the period commensurate with the expected life of the stock option and the implied volatility of traded options the use of implied volatilities was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our stock with terms similar to our awards and also upon our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility however because the expected life of our stock options is greater than the terms of our traded options we used a combination of our historical stock price volatility commensurate with the expected life of our stock options and implied volatility of traded options 

we estimated the expected life of the awards based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and postvesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the options and purchase rights the riskfree interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the expected term of the awards 

we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future accordingly our expected dividend yield is zero 

because stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures sfas 123r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 

if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas 123r in future periods the compensation expense that we record under sfas 123r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period in addition valuation models including the blackscholes and binomial models may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stockbased compensation consequently there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stockbased compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise expiration early termination or forfeiture of those stockbased payments in the future certain stockbased payments such as employee stock options may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements alternatively value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements

results of operations 

overview 

the following table is a summary of revenue gross margin and operating income for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

 

basis of presentation 

we have a 5253 week fiscal year ending on the friday nearest to december 31 which for fiscal 2008 was january 2 2009 fiscal 2008 was a 53week year fiscal 2007 and 2006 were both 52week years 

revenue 

in fiscal 2008 total revenue increased by 1070 million or 9 to 133 billion from 122 billion in fiscal 2007 the increase in fiscal 2008 was due to stronger performances in the field solutions and mobile solutions segments engineering and construction revenue decreased 16 million or 02 field solutions increased 1001 million or 50 mobile solutions increased 94 million or 6 and advanced devices decreased 09 million or 1 as compared to fiscal 2007 in fiscal 2008 revenue growth was primarily driven by new products a strong agricultural environment as well as the impact of acquisitions partially offset by softness in european and us markets in engineering and construction 

 although revenue increased by 17 on a year over year basis for the first nine months of the year our revenue in the fourth quarter declined by 14 over the corresponding quarter in the prior year although we have limited visibility into fiscal 2009 due to the current economic crisis we expect that there will be continued softness in our revenue in the first quarter of 2009 as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year particularly in our engineering and construction segment 

in fiscal 2007 total revenue increased by 2821 million or 30 to 122 billion from 9402 million in fiscal 2006 the increase in fiscal 2007 was due to stronger performances across all our operating segments engineering and construction revenue increased 1062 million or 17 field solutions increased 614 million or 44 mobile solutions increased 968 million or 159 and advanced devices increased 177 million or 17 as compared to fiscal 2006 revenue growth within these segments was primarily driven by new products a robust agricultural environment strong international growth as well as the impact of acquisitions partially offset by regional pockets of softness in the us markets 

 during fiscal 2008 sales to customers in the united states represented 49 europe represented 25 asia pacific represented 14 and other regions represented 12 of our total revenue during the 2007 fiscal year sales to customers in the united states represented 50 europe represented 27 asia pacific represented 12 and other regions represented 11 of our total revenue during fiscal 2006 sales to customers in the united states represented 54 europe represented 25 asia pacific represented 12 and other regions represented 9 of our total revenue we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to account for a major portion of our revenue 

 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenue in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 it is possible however that in future periods the failure of one or more large customers to purchase products in quantities anticipated by us may adversely affect the results of operations 

gross margin 

our gross margin varies due to a number of factors including product mix pricing distribution channel used effects of production volumes new product startup costs and foreign currency translations 

in fiscal 2008 our gross margin increased by 362 million as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to higher revenue gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 488 in fiscal 2008 and 501 in fiscal 2007 the decrease in the gross margin percentage was driven primarily by increased amortization of purchased intangibles and product mix 

in fiscal 2007 our gross margin increased by 1518 million as compared to fiscal 2006 due to higher revenue higher margin products including software and subscription revenue and improved manufacturing utilization partially offset by an increase in amortization of purchased intangibles primarily due to the acquisition of road gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 501 in fiscal 2007 and 490 in fiscal 2006 the increase in the gross margin percentage was due to higher margin products 

 because of potential product mix changes within and among the industry markets market pressures on unit selling prices fluctuations in unit manufacturing costs including increases in component prices and other factors current level gross margin cannot be assured 

operating income 

operating income increased by 72 million for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 operating income as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2008 was 140 as compared to 146 for fiscal 2007 the increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher revenue and associated gross margin the decrease in operating income percentage was primarily due by increased amortization of purchased intangibles product mix and foreign exchange 

 although our operating income increased on a year over year basis for the first nine months of the year our operating income in the fourth quarter declined as compared to the corresponding quarter in the prior year although we are reducing expenses due to the current economic crisis we may experience operating income decline in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year 

operating income increased by 429 million for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 operating income as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2007 was 146 as compared to 144 for fiscal 2006 the increase in operating income was due to higher revenue and associated gross margin and software and subscription revenue partially offset by additional amortization of purchased intangibles 

results by segment 

to achieve distribution marketing production and technology advantages in our targeted markets we manage our operations in the following four segments engineering and construction field solutions mobile solutions and advanced devices operating income loss equals net revenue less cost of sales and operating expense excluding general corporate expense amortization of purchased intangible assets inprocess research and development expense restructuring charges nonoperating income expense net and income tax provision 

the following table is a breakdown of revenue and operating income by segment for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

 

a reconciliation of our consolidated segment operating income to consolidated income before income taxes follows 

 

 

engineering and construction 

engineering and construction revenue decreased by 16 million or 02 while segment operating income decreased by 480 million or 28 for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 the revenue decrease was primarily due to recessionary conditions in the us and european markets partially offset by strength in the rest of world markets operating income decreased as a result of the slight decline in revenue product mix and operating expense associated with acquisitions in the last twelve months 

engineering and construction revenue increased by 1062 million or 17 while segment operating income increased by 380 million or 28 for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 the revenue growth was driven by all business units within the segment strong international markets acquisitions made during fiscal 2007 and foreign exchange gains segment operating income increased as a result of higher revenue and increased sales of higher margin products including software revenue and operating expense control 

field solutions 

field solutions revenue increased by approximately 1001 million or 50 while segment operating income increased by 486 million or 80 for fiscal year 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 the increase in revenue was driven primarily by strong sales of agriculture products both in the us and internationally operating income increased primarily due to increased revenue as well as improvement in product costs 

field solutions revenue increased by approximately 614 million or 44 while segment operating income increased by 236 million or 63 for fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 the increase in revenue was driven primarily by the introduction of new agricultural products and a robust agricultural market both in the us and internationally operating income increased primarily due to higher revenue and operating expense control 

mobile solutions 

mobile solutions revenue increased by 94 million or 6 while segment operating income decreased by 12 million or 9 for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 revenue grew due to increased subscription revenue and a full first quarter of road revenue as compared to a partial first quarter of road revenue in fiscal 2007 operating income decreased primarily due to increased research and development and sales expense for our new field service software partially offset by a reduction in marketing and general and administrative expenses 

 

mobile solutions revenue increased by 968 million or 159 while segment operating income increased by 100 million or 391 for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 revenue grew due to increased subscription revenue due primarily to the road acquisition operating income increased primarily due to higher subscription revenue and associated gross margin 

advanced devices 

advanced devices revenue decreased by 09 million or 1 and segment operating income increased by 72 million or 42 for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 the decrease in revenue was primarily driven by slower sales of component technologies products operating income increased due to product mix royalty and licensing revenue 

advanced devices revenue increased by 177 million or 17 and segment operating income increased by 72 million or 71 for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 the increase in revenue was primarily driven by stronger performance in our component technologies timing and embedded product revenue operating income increased due to strong timing and embedded product revenue licensing revenue associated with a nokia intellectual property agreement signed in the third quarter of 2006 and strong operating expense control 

research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 

the following table shows research and development “rd” sales and marketing and general and administrative “ga” expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions of those operating expense below 

 

overall rd sales and marketing and ga expenses increased by approximately 280 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

research and development expense increased by 168 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to the impact of new rd expense as a result of acquisitions an increase in compensation related expense an increase in rd materials and an increase due to foreign currency exchange rates all of our rd costs have been expensed as incurred overall research and development spending remained relatively constant at approximately 11 of revenue 

research and development expense increased by 276 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the impact of new rd expense as a result of acquisitions an increase in compensation related expense and an increase due to foreign currency exchange rates partially offset by decreased consulting fees all of our rd costs have been expensed as incurred overall research and development spending remained relatively constant at approximately 11 of revenue 

 we believe that the development and introduction of new products are critical to our future success and we expect to continue active development of new products 

sales and marketing expense increased by 98 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 the increase was primarily due to new sales and marketing expenses as a result of acquisitions an increase in compensation related expense and an increase in trade shows and marketing literature expense spending overall remained relatively constant at approximately 15 of revenue 

sales and marketing expense increased by 429 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 the increase was primarily due to new sales and marketing expenses as a result of acquisitions an increase in compensationrelated expense an increase due to foreign currency exchange rates and an increase in marketing expense spending overall remained relatively constant at approximately 15 of revenue 

 our future growth will depend in part on the timely development and continued viability of the markets in which we currently compete as well as our ability to continue to identify and develop new markets for our products 

general and administrative expense increased by 15 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to new ga expenses as a result of acquisitions partially offset by decreased compensation related expense and reduced deferred compensation liabilities spending overall was at approximately 7 of revenue in fiscal 2008 compared to 8 in fiscal 2007 

general and administrative expense increased by 242 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to new ga expenses as a result of acquisitions an increase in compensationrelated expense and an increase in tax and legal fees spending overall was at approximately 8 of revenue in fiscal 2007 compared to 7 in fiscal 2006 

other operating expenses 

restructuring charges 

restructuring expense for the three years ended january 2 2009 was as follows 

 

 

 

during fiscal 2008 restructuring expense of 46 million was related to decisions to streamline processes and reduce the cost structure of the company with approximately 100 employees affected worldwide of the total restructuring expense 27 million is shown as a separate line within operating expense on our consolidated statements of income and 19 million is included within cost of sales additionally 41 million is related to the engineering and construction segment and 05 million is related to the mobile solutions segment as a result of the above decisions we expect restructuring activities in the engineering and construction segment to result in additional restructuring expense totaling approximately 18 million through the first quarter of 2010 additional restructuring activities have been announced in the first fiscal quarter of 2009 

during fiscal 2007 restructuring expense of 30 million was for charges associated with the company’s acquisition of road the restructuring expense was related to the acceleration of vesting of employee stock options for certain terminated road employees of which 14 million was settled in cash and 16 million was recorded as shareholders’ equity 

restructuring costs associated with a business combination 

in addition to the restructuring expense in fiscal 2008 costs associated with exiting activities of companies we acquired in fiscal 2008 was 04 million consisting of severance and benefits costs these costs were recognized as a liability assumed in the business combinations and were included in the allocation of the cost to acquisitions and accordingly resulted in an increase to goodwill rather than an expense in fiscal 2008 the company also had 09 million in restructuring activity reversals related to costs associated with exiting activities of premerger road the reversals were primarily due to severance and benefits costs for employees whose positions were retained in a variety of functions the reversals were recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 as a reduction of the liability assumed in the purchase business combination that had been included in the allocation of the cost to acquire road and accordingly resulted in a decrease to goodwill rather than an expense reduction in fiscal 2008 

in addition to the restructuring expense in fiscal 2007 costs associated with exiting activities of premerger road of 36 million consisted of severance and benefits costs these costs were recognized as a liability assumed in the purchase business combination and were included in the allocation of the cost to acquire road and accordingly resulted in an increase to goodwill rather than an expense in fiscal 2007 

restructuring liability 

the following table summarizes the restructuring activity for 2007 and 2008 in thousands 

 

as of january 2 2009 the 19 million restructuring accrual consists of severance and benefits of the 19 million restructuring accrual 07 million is included in other current liabilities and is expected to be settled by the first half of fiscal 2009 the remaining balance of 12 million is included in other noncurrent liabilities and is expected to be settled by the first quarter of fiscal 2010 

inprocess research and development 

 

we recorded inprocess research and development iprd expense of 21 million and 19 million related to acquisitions made in fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively no iprd expense was recorded in fiscal 2008 at the date of each acquisition the projects associated with the iprd efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no alternative future uses the value of the iprd was determined using a discounted cash flow model similar to the income approach focusing on the income producing capabilities of the inprocess technologies accordingly the value assigned to these iprd amounts were charged to expense on the respective acquisition date of each of the acquired companies 

amortization of purchased and other intangible assets 

 

total amortization expense of purchased and other intangible assets was 451 million in fiscal 2008 of which 227 million was recorded in cost of sales and 224 million was recorded in operating expense total amortization expense of purchased and other intangibles represented 34 of revenue in fiscal 2008 an increase of 63 million from fiscal 2007 when it represented 32 of revenue the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of certain technology and patent intangibles as a result of acquisitions made in fiscal 2008 as well as fiscal 2007 acquisition intangibles that included a full year impact of amortization expense in fiscal 2008 

total amortization expense of purchased and other intangible assets was 387 million in fiscal 2007 of which 198 million was recorded in cost of sales and 190 million was recorded in operating expense total amortization expense of purchased and other intangibles represented 32 of revenue in fiscal 2007 an increase of 255 million from fiscal 2006 when it represented 14 of revenue the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of certain technology and patent intangibles as a result of acquisitions made in fiscal 2007 primarily road and to a lesser extent fiscal 2006 acquisition intangibles that included a full year impact of amortization expense in fiscal 2007 

nonoperating income expense net 

the following table shows nonoperating income expense net for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions of those expenses below 

 

total nonoperating income expense net increased by 10 million during fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 the increase was due to lower interest expense due to lower average outstanding debt balances and interest rates fluctuations in foreign currencies largely offset by a decrease in interest income and losses on assets in our deferred compensation plan 

total nonoperating income expense net decreased by 72 million during fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 the decrease was due to higher interest expense due to an increase in debt associated with the road acquisition fluctuations in foreign currencies partially offset by increased profits from our ctct joint venture 

income tax provision 

our effective income tax rate for fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 was 26 36 and 30 respectively the 2008 rate was less than the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the implementation of a global supply chain management structure in 2006 and 2007 we licensed our us intellectual property to a foreign affiliated legal entity and implemented a global supply chain management structure which streamlined our worldwide operations we believe that the licensing of intellectual property was effected for consideration that was equivalent to armslength negotiated pricing this resulted beginning in 2008 in a tax savings due to a lower foreign tax rate for financial statement purposes and the company’s policy with respect to its undistributed foreign subsidiaries’ earnings some of those earnings are to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no related provision for us federal and state income taxes has been provided the 2007 rate was greater than the us federal statutory rate of 35 due to impacts resulting from sfas 123r the 2006 rate was less than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to operations in foreign jurisdictions subject to an effective tax rate lower than the us and the extraterritorial income exclusion eti deduction 

the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 energy improvement and extension act of 2008 and tax extenders and alternative minimum tax relief act of 2008 hr1424 was signed into law on october 3 2008 this legislation includes a provision that retroactively extends the research tax credit from january 1 2008 to december 31 2009 the company has included the 24 million benefit of the current year research credits in the quarter ended january 2 2009 

litigation matters 

 from time to time we are involved in litigation arising out of the ordinary course of our business there are no known claims or pending litigation that are expected to have a material effect on our overall financial position results of operations or liquidity 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

other than lease commitments incurred in the normal course of business see contractual obligations table below we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities guarantee contracts retained or contingent interests in transferred assets or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity we do not have any majorityowned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements additionally we do not have any interest in or relationship with any special purpose entities 

in the normal course of business to facilitate sales of its products we indemnify other parties including customers lessors and parties to other transactions with us with respect to certain matters we have agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties these agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents 

it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under these agreements were not material and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on the consolidated balance sheets as of january 2 2009 and december 28 2007 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

cash and cash equivalents 

as of january 2 2009 cash and cash equivalents totaled 1475 million compared to 1032 million at december 28 2007 we had debt of 1516 million at january 2 2009 compared to 607 million at december 28 2007 

 our ability to continue to generate cash from operations will depend in large part on profitability the rate of collections of accounts receivable our inventory turns and our ability to manage other areas of working capital 

 we believe that our cash and cash equivalents together with our revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs and stock purchases under the stock repurchase program for at least the next twelve months 

 we anticipate that planned capital expenditures primarily for computer equipment software manufacturing tools and test equipment and leasehold improvements associated with business expansion will constitute a partial use of our cash resources decisions related to how much cash is used for investing are influenced by the expected amount of cash to be provided by operations 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 1761 million for fiscal 2008 as compared to 1870 million for fiscal 2007 this decrease of 109 million was due to a decrease in accounts payable deferred revenue income taxes payable and accrued compensation and benefits  partially offset by an increase in net income before noncash depreciation and amortization and a decrease in accounts receivable 

cash provided by operating activities was 1870 million for fiscal 2007 as compared to 1358 million for fiscal 2006 this increase of 511 million was primarily driven by an increase in net income before noncash depreciation and amortization and increases in deferred revenue and income taxes payable this was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to increased revenue 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 1217 million for fiscal 2008 as compared to 3114 million for fiscal 2007 the decrease was due to cash used for acquisitions attributable primarily to road which was acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 

cash used in investing activities was 3114 million for fiscal 2007 as compared to 1142 million for fiscal 2006 the increase was primarily attributable to cash used for the road acquisition 

financing activities 

cash used in financing activities was 64 million for fiscal 2008 as compared to cash provided of 1038 million during fiscal 2007 primarily due to stock repurchase activities partially offset by net cash borrowed from the company’s credit facilities 

cash provided by financing activities was 1038 million for fiscal 2007 as compared to 342 million for fiscal 2006 primarily related to outstanding debt that was incurred for the road acquisition 

accounts receivable and inventory metrics 

 

accounts receivable days sales outstanding were relatively flat at 69 days as of january 2 2009 as compared to 70 days as of december 28 2007 our accounts receivable days sales outstanding are calculated based on ending accounts receivable net divided by revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter times a quarterly average of 91 days the actual fiscal quarter contained 98 days however the company was shut down an additional week during the quarter our inventory turns were at 42 for fiscal 2008 as compared to 43 for fiscal 2007 our inventory turnover is based on the total cost of sales for the fiscal period over the average inventory for the corresponding fiscal period 

debt 

at the end of fiscal 2008 our total debt was comprised primarily of our revolving credit line in the amount of 1510 million at the end of fiscal 2007 out total debt was primarily comprised of a term loan in the amount of 600 million which was repaid during fiscal 2008 as of january 2 2009 and december 28 2007 there were also notes payable totaling approximately 588000 and 690000 respectively consisting of government loans to foreign subsidiaries 

on july 28 2005 we entered into a 200 million unsecured revolving credit agreement the 2005 credit facility with a syndicate of 10 banks with the bank of nova scotia as the administrative agent on february 16 2007 we amended our existing 200 million unsecured revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of 11 banks with the bank of nova scotia as the administrative agent the 2007 credit facility under the 2007 credit facility we exercised the option in the existing credit agreement to increase the availability under the revolving credit line by 100 million for an aggregate availability of up to 300 million and extended the maturity date of the revolving credit line by 18 months from july 2010 to february 2012 up to 25 million of the availability under the revolving credit line may be used to issue letters of credit and up to 20 million may be used for paying off other debts or loans the maximum leverage ratio under the 2007 credit facility is 300100 the funds available under the new 2007 credit facility may be used by us for acquisitions stock repurchases and general corporate purposes as of august 20 2008 we amended the 2007 credit facility to allow us to redeem retire or purchase trimble common stock in addition the definition of the fixed charge was amended to exclude the impact of redemptions retirements or purchases of trimble common stock from the fixed charges coverage ratio for additional discussion of our debt see note 9 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

in addition during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 we incurred a fiveyear term loan under the 2007 credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 100 million which was repaid in full during fiscal 2008 

we may borrow funds under the 2007 credit facility in us dollars or in certain other currencies and borrowings will bear interest at our option at either i a base rate based on the administrative agents prime rate plus a margin of between 0 and 0125 depending on our leverage ratio as of our most recently ended fiscal quarter or ii a reserveadjusted rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor euro interbank offered rate euribor stockholm interbank offered rate stibor or other agreedupon rate depending on the currency borrowed plus a margin of between 0625 and 1125 depending on our leverage ratio as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter our obligations under the 2007 credit facility are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries 

the 2007 credit facility contains customary affirmative negative and financial covenants including among other requirements negative covenants that restrict our ability to dispose of assets create liens incur indebtedness repurchase stock pay dividends make acquisitions make investments enter into mergers and consolidations and make capital expenditures within certain limitations and financial covenants that require the maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios the 2007 credit facility contains events of default that include among others nonpayment of principal interest or fees breach of covenants inaccuracy of representations and warranties cross defaults to certain other indebtedness bankruptcy and insolvency events material judgments and events constituting a change of control upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default interest on the obligations will accrue at an increased rate and the lenders may accelerate our obligations under the 2007 credit facility however that acceleration will be automatic in the case of bankruptcy and insolvency events of default as of january 2 2009 we were in compliance with all financial debt covenants 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at january 2 2009 

 

1 we may borrow funds under the 2007 credit facility in us dollars or in certain other currencies and will bear interest as described under note 9 of notes to the consolidated financial statements our obligations under the 2007 credit facility are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries we estimate the interest to be 34 per annum based upon a historical average 

total debt consists of a revolving credit line of 1510 million under our credit facilities and government loans of 06 million to foreign subsidiaries see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further financial information regarding longterm debt 

other purchase obligations and commitments represent open noncancelable purchase orders for material purchases with our vendors purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty our pension obligation which is not included in the table above is included in “other current liabilities” and “other noncurrent liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets additionally as of january 2 2009 we had acquisition earnouts of 63 million and holdbacks of 208 million recorded in “other current liabilities” and “other noncurrent liabilities” the maximum remaining payments including the 63 million and 208 million recorded will not exceed 717 million the remaining earnouts and holdbacks are payable through 2012 

we adopted fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” fin 48 on december 30 2006 a total of 373 million including interest and penalties represents the fin 48 liability at january 2 2009 at this time we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with tax authorities regarding this liability 

effect of new accounting pronouncements 

the impact of recent accounting pronouncements is disclosed in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors 

market interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds treasury bills commercial paper fdic insured interest and noninterest bearing bank deposits as well as bank time deposits for fiscal 2008 and 2007 the main objective of these instruments was safety of principal and liquidity while maximizing return without significantly increasing risk 

 due to the shortterm nature of our cash equivalents we do not anticipate any material effect on our portfolio due to fluctuations in interest rates 

we are exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing interest rates under our senior secured credit facilities our credit facility is comprised of an unsecured revolving credit agreement with a maturity date of february 2012 we may borrow funds under the revolving credit agreement in us dollars or in certain other currencies and borrowings will bear interest as described under note 9 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

as of january 2 2009 we had an outstanding balance on the revolving credit line of 1510 million and during fiscal 2008 we repaid the remaining outstanding principal balance on our term loan a hypothetical 10 increase in the threemonth libor rates could result in approximately 02 million annual increase in interest expense on the existing principal balances 

 the hypothetical changes and assumptions made above will be different from what actually occurs in the future furthermore the computations do not anticipate actions that may be taken by our management should the hypothetical market changes actually occur over time as a result actual earnings effects in the future will differ from those quantified above 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain trade and intercompany receivables and payables primarily denominated in australian canadian japanese new zealand south african and swedish currencies the euro and the british pound these contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements as the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses on the forward contracts these instruments are marked to market through earnings every period and generally range from one to three months in original maturity we do not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for trading purposes 

foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of january 2 2009 and december 28 2007 are summarized as follows in thousands 

 

 we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position utilizing our current hedging strategy

business 

tableend 

trimble navigation limited a california corporation “trimble” or “the company” or “we” or “our” or “us” provides advanced positioning product solutions typically to commercial and government users the principal application areas include surveying agriculture construction asset management mapping and mobile resource management our products provide benefits that can include lower operational costs higher productivity and improved quality product examples include agricultural and construction equipment guidance systems surveying instruments systems that track fleets of vehicles and data collection systems that enable the management of large amounts of georeferenced information in addition we also manufacture components for invehicle navigation and telematics systems and timing modules used in the synchronization of wireless networks 

our products often combine knowledge of location or position with a wireless link to provide a solution for a specific application position is provided through a number of technologies including the global positioning system gps and systems that use laser or optical technologies to establish position wireless communication techniques include both public networks such as cellular and private networks such as business band radio our products are augmented by our software this includes embedded firmware that enables the positioning solution and application software that allows the customer to make use of the positioning information 

we design and market our own products our manufacturing strategy includes a combination of inhouse assembly and third party subcontractors our global operations include major development manufacturing or logistics operations in the united states sweden germany new zealand france canada the united kingdom the netherlands china and india products are sold through dealers representatives joint ventures and other channels throughout the world these channels are supported by our sales offices located in more than 18 countries 

we began operations in 1978 and incorporated in california in 1981 our common stock has been publicly traded on nasdaq since 1990 under the symbol trmb 

on january 17 2007 trimble’s board of directors approved a 2for1 split of all outstanding shares of the company’s common stock payable february 22 2007 to stockholders of record on february 8 2007 all shares and per share information presented have been adjusted to reflect the stock split on a retroactive basis for all periods presented 

technology overview 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from applying global navigation satellite system gnss technology to terrestrial applications the gnss includes the gps network of 24 orbiting us based satellites and associated ground control that is funded and maintained by the u s government and is available worldwide free of charge and the russian glonass satellite based system both europe and china have announced plans to establish future operational satellite navigation based systems gnss positioning is based on a technique that precisely measures distances from four or more satellites the satellites continuously transmit precisely timed radio signals using extremely accurate atomic clocks a gnss receiver measures distances from the satellites in view by determining the travel time of a signal from the satellite to the receiver and then uses those distances to compute its position under normal circumstances a standalone gnss receiver is able to calculate its position at any point on earth in the earths atmosphere or in lower earth orbit to approximately 10 meters 24 hours a day much better accuracies are possible through a technique called “differential gnss” in addition to providing position gnss provides extremely accurate time measurement 

gnss accuracy is dependent upon the locations of the receiver and the number of gnss satellites that are above the horizon at any given time reception of gnss signals requires lineofsight visibility between the satellites and the receiver which can be blocked by buildings hills and dense foliage the receiver must have a line of sight to at least four satellites to determine its latitude longitude attitude angular orientation and time the accuracy of gnss may also be limited by distortion of gnss signals from ionospheric and other atmospheric conditions 

our gnss products are based on proprietary receiver technology over time the advances in positioning wireless communications and information technologies have enabled us to add more capability to our products and thereby deliver more value to our users for example the developments in wireless technology and deployments of next generation wireless networks have enabled less expensive wireless communications these developments provide the efficient transfer of position data to locations away from the positioning field device allowing the data to be accessed by more users thereby increasing productivity this allows us to integrate visualization and design software into our systems as well as offers positioning services all of which make our customers more efficient at what they do 

our laser and optical products either measure distances and angles to provide a position in three dimensional space or they provide highly accurate laser references from which a position can be established the key element of these products is typically a laser which is generally a commercially available laser diode and a complex mechanical assembly these elements are augmented by software algorithms 

 

 

business strategy 

 

our business strategy is developed around an analysis of several key elements 

 

 

 

 

business segments and markets 

we are organized into four reporting segments encompassing our various applications and product lines engineering and construction field solutions mobile solutions and advanced devices our segments are distinguished by the markets they serve each segment consists of businesses which are responsible for product development marketing sales strategy and financial performance the presentation of prior period’s segment operating results has been conformed to our current segment presentation 

engineering and construction 

products in the engineering and construction segment improve productivity and accuracy throughout the entire construction process including the initial survey planning design site preparation and building phases our products are intended to both improve the productivity of each phase as well as facilitate the entire process by improving information flow from one phase to the next 

the product solutions typically include multiple technologies the elements of these solutions may incorporate gps optical laser radio or cellular communications 

an example of the customer benefits provided by our products is our gps and robotic optical surveying instruments which enable the surveyor to perform operations in the field faster more reliably than conventional surveying instruments and with a smaller crew similarly our construction machine guidance products allow the operator to achieve the desired landform while eliminating stakeout and reducing rework these steps in the construction process can be readily linked together with data collection modules to minimize the time and effort required to maintain data accuracy throughout the entire construction process 

we sell and distribute our products in this segment through a global network of independent dealers that are supported by trimble personnel this channel is supplemented by relationships that create additional channel breadth including our joint ventures with caterpillar nikon and private branding arrangements with other companies 

we also design and market handheld data collectors and data collection software for field use by surveyors contractors and other professionals these products are sold directly through dealers and other survey manufacturers

while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from the estimates revisions to the estimated warranty accrual and related costs may be required 

seasonality of business 

 our individual segment revenues may be affected by seasonal buying patterns typically the second fiscal quarter has been the strongest quarter for the company driven by the construction buying season 

backlog 

in most of our markets the time between order placement and shipment is short orders are generally placed by customers on an asneeded basis in general customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty for these reasons we do not believe that orders are an accurate measure of backlog and therefore we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future revenues or material to understanding our business 

manufacturing 

manufacturing of many of our gps products is subcontracted to flextronics international limited we utilize flextronics for all of our component technologies products and for some of our construction and survey field solutions and handheld products we also utilize flextronics for our highend gps products and new product introduction services flextronics is responsible for substantially all material procurement assembly and testing we continue to manage product design through pilot production for the subcontracted products and we are directly involved in qualifying suppliers and key components used in all our products our current contract with flextronics continues in effect until either party gives the other ninety days written notice

risk factors 

tableend 

risks and uncertainties 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k and in any other documents to which we refer you in this form 10k before purchasing our securities the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 

our inability to accurately predict orders and shipments may subject our results of operations to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter 

we have not been able in the past to consistently predict when our customers will place orders and request shipments so that we cannot always accurately plan our manufacturing requirements as a result if orders and shipments differ from what we predict we may incur additional expenses and build excess inventory which may require additional reserves and allowances accordingly we have limited visibility into future changes in demand and our results of operations may be subject to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter 

our operating results in each quarter may be affected by special conditions such as seasonality late quarter purchases weather and other potential issues 

due in part to the buying patterns of our customers a significant portion of our quarterly revenues occurs from orders received and immediately shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of each quarter although our operating expenses tend to remain fairly predictable engineering and construction purchases tend to occur in early spring and governmental agencies tend to utilize funds available at the end of the government’s fiscal year for additional purchases at the end of our third fiscal quarter in september of each year concentrations of orders sometimes also occur at the end of our other two fiscal quarters additionally a majority of our sales force earns commissions on a quarterly basis which may cause concentrations of orders at the end of any fiscal quarter it could harm our operating results if for any reason expected sales are deferred orders are not received or shipments are delayed a few days at the end of a quarter 

we are dependent on a specific manufacturer and assembler for many of our products and on specific suppliers of critical parts for our products 

we are substantially dependent upon flextronics international limited as our preferred manufacturing partner for many of our gps products under the agreement we provide to flextronics a twelvemonth product forecast and place purchase orders with flextronics at least thirty calendar days in advance of the scheduled delivery of products to our customers depending on production lead time although purchase orders placed with flextronics are cancelable the terms of the agreement would require us to purchase from flextronics all inventory not returnable or usable by other flextronics customers accordingly if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products we may be unable to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity from flextronics to meet customers’ delivery requirements or we may accumulate excess inventories if such inventories are not usable by other flextronics customers our current contract with flextronics continues in effect until either party gives the other ninety days written notice  

in addition we rely on specific suppliers for a number of our critical components we have experienced shortages of components in the past our current reliance on specific or a limited group of suppliers involves several risks including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components and reduced control over pricing any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture such components internally could significantly delay our ability to ship our products which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our reputation and brand as well as our operating results 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate which could negatively impact our operations and our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control results in any period could be affected by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition demand for our products in any quarter or year may vary due to the seasonal buying patterns of our customers in the agricultural and engineering and construction industries the price of our common stock could decline substantially in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors which are based primarily on historical models that are not necessarily accurate representations of the future 

our gross margin is subject to fluctuation 

our gross margin is affected by a number of factors including product mix product pricing cost of components foreign currency exchange rates and manufacturing costs for example sales of nikonbranded products generally have lower gross margin as compared to our gps survey products absent other factors a shift in sales towards nikonbranded products would lead to a reduction in our overall gross margin a decline in gross margin could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

we are dependent on new products and if we are unable to successfully introduce them into the market our customer base may decline or fail to grow as anticipated 

our future revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to bring new products to market on a timely basis we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance of such products we may incur problems in the future in innovating and introducing new products our development stage products may not be successfully completed or if developed may not achieve significant customer acceptance if we were unable to successfully define develop and introduce competitive new products and enhance existing products our future results of operations would be adversely affected development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and we might not achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success if we are unable to introduce new products if other companies develop similar technology products or if we do not develop compelling new products the number of customers may not grow as anticipated or may decline which could harm our operating results 

we are dependent on proprietary technology which could result in litigation that could divert significant valuable resources and impair our liquidity 

our future success and competitive position is dependent upon our proprietary technology and we rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright law to protect our intellectual property the patents owned or licensed by us may be invalidated circumvented and challenged the rights granted under these patents may not provide competitive advantages to us any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us if at all 

others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology duplicate our technology or design around the patents owned by us in addition effective copyright patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in certain countries the steps taken by us to protect our technology might not prevent the misappropriation of such technology 

the value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many current patent filings we recognize that as new patents are issued or are brought to our attention by the holders of such patents it may be necessary for us to withdraw products from the market take a license from such patent holders or redesign our products we do not believe any of our products currently infringe patents or other proprietary rights of third parties but we cannot be certain they do not do so in addition the legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant expense of operations any such litigation could require us to incur substantial costs and divert significant valuable resources including the efforts of our technical and management personnel which may impair our liquidity 

investing in and integrating new acquisitions could be costly and may place a significant strain on our management systems and resources 

we have recently acquired a number of companies including road and intend to continue to acquire other companies acquisitions of companies entail numerous risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a result of such acquisitions we have significant assets that include goodwill and other purchased intangibles the testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines for impairment requires significant use of judgment and assumptions changes in business conditions could require adjustments to the valuation of these assets in addition losses incurred by a company in which we have an investment may have a direct impact on our financial statements or could result in our having to writedown the value of such investment any such problems in integration or adjustments to the value of the assets acquired could harm our growth strategy and could be costly and place a significant strain on our management systems and resources 

our products may contain errors or defects which could result in damage to our reputation lost revenues diverted development resources and increased service costs warranty claims and litigation 

 

we warrant that our products will be free of defect for various periods of time depending on the product in addition certain of our contracts include epidemic failure clauses if invoked these clauses may entitle the customer to return or obtain credits for products and inventory or to cancel outstanding purchase orders even if the products themselves are not defective 

we must develop our products quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing market and we have a history of frequently introducing new products products and services as sophisticated as ours could contain undetected errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new models or versions are released in general our products may not be free from errors or defects after commercial shipments have begun which could result in damage to our reputation lost revenues diverted development resources increased customer service and support costs and warranty claims and litigation 

we are dependent on the availability of allocated bands within the radio frequency spectrum 

our gnss technology is dependent on the use of satellite signals from space and on terrestrial communication bands international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union itu a specialized technical agency of the united nations these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used 

any itu or local reallocation of radio frequency bands including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products many of our products use other radio frequency bands together with the gnss signal to provide enhanced gnss capabilities such as realtime kinematic precision the continuing availability of these nongnss radio frequencies is essential to provide enhanced gnss products to our precision survey agriculture and construction machine controls markets any regulatory changes in spectrum allocation or in allowable operating conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have certain products such as gps rtk systems and surveying and mapping systems that use integrated radio communication technology requiring access to available radio frequencies allocated to local government some bands are experiencing congestion in the us the fcc announced that it will require migration of radio technology from wideband to narrowband operations in these bands the rules require migration of users to narrowband channels by 2011 in the meantime congestion could cause fcc coordinators to restrict or refuse licenses an inability to obtain access to these radio frequencies by end users could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

many of our products rely on gnss technology the gps and other satellite systems which may become inoperable and result in lost revenue 

gnss technology gps satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage the gps satellites currently in orbit were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of 30 satellites in place some have already been in operation for more than 12 years to repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites a reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities 

as the only complete gnss currently in operation we are dependent on continued operation of gps gps is operated by the u s government which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps however if the policy were to change and gps were no longer supported by the u s government or if user fees were imposed it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

many of our products also use signals from systems that augment gps such as the wide area augmentation system waas and national differential gps system ndgps many of these augmentation systems are operated by the federal government and rely on continued funding and maintenance of these systems in addition some of our products also use satellite signals from the russian glonass system any curtailment of the operating capability of these systems could result in decreased user capability thereby impacting our markets 

the european governments have begun development of an independent satellite navigation system known as galileo we have access to the preliminary signal design which is subject to change although an operational galileo system is several years away if we are unable to develop a timely commercial product it could result in lost revenue which could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war or terrorism 

acts of war or acts of terrorism especially any directed at the gps signals could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may invoke a redeployment of the satellites used in gps or interruptions of the system to the extent that such interruptions result in delays or cancellations of orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and although we hedge against these risks our attempts to hedge could be unsuccessful and expose us to losses 

a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the us and as such we face exposure to movements in nonus currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows fluctuation in currency impacts our operating results 

currently we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities our attempts to hedge against these risks could be unsuccessful and expose us to losses 

our debt could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations 

on february 16 2007 we amended and restated our existing 200 million unsecured revolving credit agreement to an aggregate availability of up to 300 million our debt could have important consequences such as 

 

 

 

 

additionally if we were to default under our amended credit agreement and were unable to obtain a waiver for such a default interest on the obligations would accrue at an increased rate and the lenders could accelerate our obligations under the amended credit agreement however that acceleration will be automatic in the case of bankruptcy and insolvency events of default additionally our subsidiaries that have guaranteed the amended credit agreement could be required to pay the full amount of our obligations under the amended credit agreement any such action on the part of the lenders against us could harm our financial condition 

we may not be able to enter into or maintain important alliances 

we believe that in certain business opportunities our success will depend on our ability to form and maintain alliances with industry participants such as caterpillar nikon and cnh global our failure to form and maintain such alliances or the preemption of such alliances by actions of competitors or us will adversely affect our ability to penetrate emerging markets if we experience problems from current or future alliances it could harm our operating results and we may not be able to realize value from any such strategic alliances 

we face competition in our markets which could decrease our revenues and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition 

our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price quality and performance of our products the level of customer service the development of new technology and our ability to participate in emerging markets within each of our markets we encounter direct competition from other gps optical and laser suppliers and competition may intensify from various larger us and nonus competitors and new market entrants particularly from emerging markets such as china and india the competition in the future may in some cases result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could decrease our revenues and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the future against existing and additional competitors will depend largely on our ability to execute our strategy to provide systems and products with significantly differentiated features compared to currently available products we may not be able to implement this strategy successfully and our products may not be competitive with other technologies or products that may be developed by our competitors many of whom have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing sales and other resources than we do 

we are subject to the impact of governmental and other similar certifications and failure to obtain the requisite certifications could harm our operating results 

we market certain products that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold for example ce certification for radiated emissions is required for most gps receiver and data communications products sold in the european union an inability to obtain such certifications in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our operating results also some of our products that use integrated radio communication technology require product type certification and some products require an end user to obtain licensing from the fcc for frequencyband usage these are secondary licenses that are subject to certain restrictions an inability or delay in obtaining such certifications or changes to the rules by the fcc could adversely affect our ability to bring our products to market which could harm our customer relationships and therefore our operating results any failure to obtain the requisite certifications could also harm our operating results 

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect your investment in our common stock 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile during fiscal 2007 our stock price ranged from 2547 to 5741 on a postsplit basis we believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate perhaps substantially including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of hightech companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the market price of our common stock may decline 

 

provisions in our charter documents and under california law could prevent or delay a change of control which could reduce the market price of our common stock 

certain provisions of our articles of incorporation as amended and restated our bylaws as amended and restated and the california general corporation law may be deemed to have an antitakeover effect and could discourage a third party from acquiring or make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without approval of our board of directors these provisions could also limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock certain provisions allow the board of directors to authorize the issuance of preferred stock with rights superior to those of the common stock 

we have adopted a preferred shares rights agreement commonly known as a poison pill the provisions described above our poison pill and provisions of the california general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that reflect our plans estimates and beliefs our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and those listed under risks factors 

executive level overview 

trimble’s focus is on combining positioning technology with wireless communication and application capabilities to create systemlevel solutions that enhance productivity and accuracy for our customers the majority of our markets are enduser markets including engineering and construction firms governmental organizations public safety workers farmers and companies who must manage fleets of mobile workers and assets in our advanced devices segment we also provide components to original equipment manufacturers to incorporate into their products in the end user markets we provide a system that includes a hardware platform that may contain software and customer support some examples of our solutions include products that automate and simplify the process of surveying land products that automate the utilization of equipment such as tractors and bulldozers products that enable a company to manage its mobile workforce and assets and products that allow municipalities to manage their fixed assets 

solutions targeted at the enduser make up a significant majority of our revenue to create compelling products we must attain an understanding of the end users’ needs and work flow and how locationbased technology can enable that end user to work faster more efficiently and more accurately we use this knowledge to create highly innovative products that change the way work is done by the enduser with the exception of our mobile solutions and advanced devices segments our products are generally sold through a dealer channel and it is crucial that we maintain a proficient global thirdparty distribution channel 

during 2007 we continued to execute our strategy with a series of actions that can be summarized in four categories 

reinforcing our position in existing markets 

 we believe that our markets provide us with additional substantial potential for substituting our technology for traditional methods in 2007 we continued to develop new products and to strengthen our distribution channels in order to expand our market opportunity a number of new products such as the ag gps ezguide 500 system juno™st handheld computer spectra precision gl412 and 422 grade lasers and trimble ccs900 compaction control system strengthened our competitive position and created new value for the user 

extending our position in existing markets through new product categories 

 we are utilizing the strength of the trimble brand in our markets to expand our revenues by bringing new products to existing users in fiscal 2007 we introduced the trimble vx spatial station and a suite of interactive product training modules for the engineering and construction industry 

bringing existing technology to new markets 

 we continue to reinforce our position in existing markets and position ourselves in newer markets that will serve as important sources of future growth our efforts in asia pacific including china india and russia and europe including eastern europe all reflected improving financial results with the promise of more in the future 

 

entering new market segments 

 in 2007 we acquired road a global provider of solutions designed to automate the management of mobile resources and to optimize the service delivery process for customers across a variety of industries inpho a leader in photogrammetry and digital surface modeling for aerial surveying mapping and remote sensing applications ingenieurbüro breining a provider of customized field data collection and office software solutions for the cadastral survey market in germany we also acquired utilitycenter assets from uai inc which is a leading provider of geographic information system gisbased workflow automation and outage management solutions for electric and gas utilities and hhk datentechnik a provider of customized office and field software solutions for the cadastral survey market in germany 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements we consider the accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting polices these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

revenue recognition 

we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists shipment has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer or is uncertain revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 

contracts andor customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement shipping documents and customer acceptance when applicable are used to verify delivery we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis as well as the customer’s payment history 

revenue for orders is not recognized until the product is shipped and title has transferred to the buyer we bear all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods up to that point our shipment terms for us orders and international orders fulfilled from our european distribution center typically provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the carrier named by the buyer at the named place or point if no precise point is indicated by the buyer we may choose within the place or range stipulated where the carrier will take the goods into carrier’s charge other shipment terms may provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the buyer shipping and handling costs are included in the cost of goods sold 

revenue to distributors and resellers is recognized upon shipment assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met distributors and resellers do not have a right of return 

revenue from purchased extended warranty and support agreements is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the warrantysupport period 

we present revenue net of sales taxes and any similar assessments 

we apply statement of position sop no 972 “software revenue recognition” to products where the embedded software is more than incidental to the functionality of the hardware this determination requires significant judgment including a consideration of factors such as marketing research and development efforts and any postcustomer contract support pcs relating to the embedded software 

our software arrangements generally consist of a perpetual license fee and pcs we have established vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for our pcs contracts based on renewal rates the remaining value of the software arrangement is allocated to the license fee using the residual method license revenue is primarily recognized when the software has been delivered and there are no remaining obligations revenue from pcs is recognized ratably over the term of the pcs agreement 

we apply eitf issue 003 application of aicpa statement of position 972 to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entitys hardware for hosted arrangements which the customer does not have the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without incurring a significant penalty and it is not feasible for the customer to run the software either on its own hardware or on a thirdparty’s hardware subscription revenue related to our hosted arrangements is recognized ratably over the contract period upfront fees for our hosted solution primarily consist of amounts for the invehicle enabling hardware device and peripherals if any for upfront fees relating to propriety hardware where the firmware is more than incidental to the functionality of the hardware in accordance with sop no 972 “software revenue recognition” we defer the upfront fees at installation and recognize them ratably over the minimum service contract period generally one to five years product costs are also deferred and amortized over such period 

in accordance with eitf issue 0021 “accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” when a nonsoftware sale involves multiple elements the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each element is met 

allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns 

our accounts receivable balance net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns reserve was 2399 million as of december 28 2007 as compared with 1771 million as of december 29 2006 the allowance for doubtful accounts was 52 million and 41 million as of december 28 2007 and december 29 2006 respectively we evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors such as age of the accounts receivable balances credit quality historical experience and current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us a specific allowance for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 

a reserve for sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates experienced in the ordinary course of business the reserve for sales returns as of december 28 2007 and december 29 2006 were 17 million and 859000 respectively for estimated future returns that were recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established our revenue could be adversely affected 

inventory valuation 

our inventories net balance was 1430 million as of december 28 2007 compared with 1126 million as of december 29 2006 our inventory allowances as of december 28 2007 were 296 million as compared with 286 million as of december 29 2006 our inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or market adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value if required are made for estimated excess obsolescence or impaired balances factors influencing these adjustments include decline in demand technological changes product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues if actual factors are less favorable than those projected by us additional inventory writedowns may be required 

income taxes 

 

income taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred tax assets or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized 

our valuation allowance is attributable to primarily acquisition related net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize these deferred tax assets and accordingly a valuation allowance has been provided for such amounts when the tax attributes are utilized and the valuation allowance is released the benefit of the release of the valuation allowance will be accounted for as a credit to goodwill rather than as a reduction of the income tax provision  

goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of entities accounted for using the purchase method of accounting are estimated by management based on the fair value of assets received identifiable intangible assets are comprised of distribution channels patents licenses technology acquired backlog and trademarks identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straightline method and estimated useful lives ranging from one to ten years with a weighted average useful life of 62 years goodwill is not subject to amortization but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment applying a fairvalue based test 

impairment of goodwill intangible assets and other longlived assets 

we evaluate goodwill at a minimum on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing a twostep process first impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit’s carrying amount including goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a discounted cash flow approach if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in step two the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill the difference is recognized as an impairment loss our evaluation resulted in no impairment of goodwill 

depreciation and amortization of the intangible assets and other longlived assets is provided using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives reflecting the pattern of economic benefits associated with these assets changes in circumstances such as technological advances changes to our business model or changes in the capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives of intangible assets or other longlived assets differing from initial estimates in those cases where we determine that the useful life of an asset should be revised the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value will be expensed and the residual value is depreciated over its revised remaining useful life these assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable based on their future cash flows the estimated future cash flows are based upon among other things assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows the assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value no indicators of impairment have been identified 

warranty costs 

the liability for product warranties was 108 million as of december 28 2007 as compared with 86 million as of december 29 2006 we accrue for warranty costs as part of cost of sales based on associated material product costs technical support labor costs and costs incurred by third parties performing work on our behalf our expected future cost is primarily estimated based upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment the products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to three years and in some instances up to 55 years 

while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates revisions to the estimated warranty accrual and related costs may be required 

stock compensation 

beginning in fiscal 2006 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” sfas 123r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to our employees and directors including stock option and rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans based on estimated fair values we adopted sfas 123r using the modified prospective application method under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes prior to fiscal 2006 we applied accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 25 and the disclosure provisions of sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” sfas 123 as a result the company’s financial statements for fiscal 2006 include stockbased compensation expenses that are not comparable to financial statements prior to fiscal 2006 

stockbased compensation expense recognized in the company’s consolidated statements of income for the period includes compensation expense for awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of december 30 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas 123 and compensation expense for awards granted subsequent to december 30 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas 123r the fair value of rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans was estimated using the blackscholes optionpricing model for stock options granted prior to october 1 2005 the fair value was estimated at the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model for stock options granted on or after october 1 2005 the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial valuation model 

the determination of fair value of sharebased payment awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors riskfree interest rates and expected dividends in addition the binomial model incorporates actual optionpricing behavior and changes in volatility over the option’s contractual term 

beginning in fiscal 2006 our expected stock price volatility for stock purchase rights is based on implied volatilities of traded options on our stock and our expected stock price volatility for stock options is based on a combination of our historical stock price volatility for the period commensurate with the expected life of the stock option and the implied volatility of traded options the use of implied volatilities was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our stock with terms similar to our awards and also upon our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility however because the expected life of our stock options is greater than the terms of our traded options we used a combination of our historical stock price volatility commensurate with the expected life of our stock options and implied volatility of traded options prior to fiscal 2006 we used our historical stock price volatility in accordance with sfas 123 for purposes of our proforma information 

we estimated the expected life of the awards based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and postvesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the options and purchase rights the riskfree interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the expected term of the awards 

we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future accordingly our expected dividend yield is zero 

because stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2007 and 2006 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures sfas 123r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 

if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas 123r in future periods the compensation expense that we record under sfas 123r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period in addition valuation models including the blackscholes and binomial models may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stockbased compensation consequently there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stockbased compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise expiration early termination or forfeiture of those stockbased payments in the future certain stockbased payments such as employee stock options may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements alternatively value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 

see note 2 and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

results of operations 

overview 

the following table is a summary of revenue gross margin and operating income for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

 

basis of presentation 

we have a 5253 week fiscal year ending on the friday nearest to december 31 which for fiscal 2007 was december 28 2007 fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 were all 52week years 

revenue 

in fiscal 2007 total revenue increased by 2821 million or 30 to 12223 million from 9402 million in fiscal 2006 the increase in fiscal 2007 was due to stronger performances across all our operating segments engineering and construction revenue increased 1062 million or 17 field solutions increased 614 million or 44 mobile solutions increased 968 million or 159 and advanced devices increased 177 million or 17 as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2006 revenue growth within these segments was primarily driven by new products a robust agricultural environment strong international growth as well as the impact of acquisitions of 978 million partially offset by regional pockets of softness in the us markets 

in fiscal 2006 total revenue increased by 1652 million or 21 to 9402 million from 7749 million in fiscal 2005 the increase in fiscal 2006 was primarily due to stronger performance across all our operating segments the engineering and construction field solutions mobile solutions and advanced devices segments increased 21 9 93 and 13 respectively as compared to fiscal 2005 revenue growth within these segments was driven by new product introductions increased penetration of existing markets and geographical expansion mobile solutions growth in particular benefited from the prior year acquisitions overall 2006 acquisitions impacted total company revenue growth by approximately 2 

 during fiscal 2007 sales to customers in the united states represented 50 europe represented 27 asia pacific represented 12 and other regions represented 11 of our total revenues during the 2006 fiscal year sales to customers in the united states represented 54 europe represented 25 asia pacific represented 12 and other regions represented 9 of our total revenues during fiscal 2005 sales to customers in the united states represented 54 europe represented 25 asia pacific represented 11 and other regions represented 10 of our total revenues we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to account for a major portion of our revenues 

 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 it is possible however that in future periods the failure of one or more large customers to purchase products in quantities anticipated by us may adversely affect the results of operations 

gross margin 

our gross margin varies due to a number of factors including product mix pricing distribution channel used effects of production volumes new product startup costs and foreign currency translations 

in fiscal 2007 our gross margin increased by 1518 million as compared to fiscal 2006 due to higher revenue higher margin products including software and subscription revenue and improved manufacturing utilization partially offset by an increase of 145 million in amortization of purchased intangibles primarily due to the acquisition of road gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 501 in fiscal 2007 and 490 in fiscal 2006 the increase in the gross margin percentage was driven primarily by a 2 percentage point increase due to higher margin products including software and subscription revenue offset by a decrease of 1 percentage point due to increased amortization of purchased intangibles 

in fiscal 2006 our gross margin increased by 713 million as compared to fiscal 2005 due to higher revenue and the success of higher margin products including survey and machine control products and higher subscription revenues the increase was partially offset by decreases due to the impact of the reclassification of the caterpillar trimble control technologies ctct transactions of 181 million previously recorded in nonoperating expenses amortization of softwarerelated purchased intangibles of 52 million and stockbased compensation expense of 12 million that were not included in gross margin during the same period in fiscal 2005 gross margin as a percentage of total revenues was 490 in fiscal 2006 and 503 in fiscal 2005 the decrease in the gross margin percentage was driven primarily by a decrease of 3 percentage points due to the ctct impact amortization of purchased intangibles and stockbased compensation offset by an increase of 2 percentage points due to higher margin products and subscription revenues 

 because of potential product mix changes within and among the industry markets market pressures on unit selling prices fluctuations in unit manufacturing costs including increases in component prices and other factors current level gross margin cannot be assured 

operating income 

operating income increased by 429 million for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 operating income as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2007 was 146 as compared to 144 for fiscal 2006 due to higher revenue and associated gross margin and software and subscription revenue partially offset by additional amortization of purchased intangibles 

operating income increased by 104 million for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 due to higher revenues and the success of higher margin products offset by decreases due to the impact of the reclassification of the ctct transactions previously recorded in nonoperating expenses and stockbased compensation expense that was not included in the operating income during fiscal 2005 

operating income as a percentage of total revenue was 144 for fiscal 2006 compared to 161 in fiscal 2005   the decrease in operating income was due to a 4 percentage point ctct transaction reclassification impact amortization of purchased intangibles increased acquisition expenses and stockbased compensation impact partially offset by 2 percentage point increase driven by gross margin expansion 

results by segment 

to achieve distribution marketing production and technology advantages in our targeted markets we manage our operations in the following four segments engineering and construction field solutions mobile solutions and advanced devices operating income loss equals net revenue less cost of sales and operating expenses excluding general corporate expenses amortization of purchased intangibles inprocess research and development expenses restructuring charges nonoperating income expense and income taxes 

in the first fiscal quarter of 2006 we combined the operating results of the former component technologies and portfolio technologies segments and included the combined operating results in the advanced devices segment the change in presentation was made in recognition of the small size of each of the businesses relative to the total company the presentation of prior periods’ segment operating results has been changed to conform to our current segment presentation 

the following table is a breakdown of revenue and operating income by segment for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

 

a reconciliation of our consolidated segment operating income to consolidated income before income taxes follows 

 

 

engineering and construction 

engineering and construction revenues increased by 1062 million or 17 while segment operating income increased by 380 million or 28 for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 the revenue growth was driven by all business units within the segment strong international markets acquisitions made during the last twelve months and foreign exchange gains segment operating income increased as a result of higher revenue and increased sales of higher margin products including software revenue and operating expense control 

engineering and construction revenues increased by 1127 million or 21 while segment operating income increased by 182 million or 15 for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 the revenue growth was driven by the continued strength in survey products as well as increased sales of machine control products aggressive marketing programs and geographic expansion segment operating income increased as a result of higher revenues and increased sales of higher margin products partially offset by expenses related to ctct transactions and stockbased compensation expense that were not present in fiscal 2005 

field solutions 

field solutions revenues increased by approximately 614 million or 44 while segment operating income increased by 236 million or 63 for fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 revenue was driven primarily by the introduction of new agricultural products and a robust agricultural market both in the us and internationally operating income increased primarily due to higher revenue and operating expense control 

field solutions revenues increased by approximately 114 million or 9 while segment operating income increased by 49 million or 15 for fiscal year 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 revenue increased primarily due to growth in our gis business in gis growth was due to new products and a continuing shift to a higher value differentiated distribution channel operating income increased primarily due to increased revenue partially offset by the inclusion of stockbased compensation that was not present in fiscal 2005 

mobile solutions 

mobile solutions revenues increased by 968 million or 159 while segment operating income increased by 100 million or 391 for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 revenue grew due to increased subscription revenue due primarily to the road acquisition operating income increased primarily due to higher subscription revenue and associated gross margin

advanced devices 

advanced devices revenues increased by 177 million or 17 and segment operating income increased by 72 million or 71 for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 the increase in revenue was primarily driven by stronger performance in our component technologies timing and embedded product revenue operating income increased due to strong timing and embedded product revenue licensing revenue associated with a nokia intellectual property agreement signed in the third quarter of 2006 and strong operating expense control 

advanced devices revenues increased by 118 million or 13 while segment operating income decreased by 31 million or 24 for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 the increase in revenue was primarily due to stronger performance in our embedded and airborne products as well as licensing revenues associated with a nokia intellectual property agreement signed in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 operating income decreased for fiscal 2006 due to sales of lower gross margin products a reduction in revenue in our military and advanced systems product line increased costs related to the trimtrac product line and inclusion of stockbased compensation that were not present in the corresponding periods of fiscal 2005 partially offset by stronger embedded and airborne product revenue and intellectual property licensing revenue

the following table shows research and development “rd” sales and marketing and general and administrative “ga” expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues for the fiscal years ended 2007 2006 and 2005 and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions of those operating expenses below 

 

overall rd sales and marketing and ga expenses increased by approximately 947 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

research and development expenses increased by 276 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the inclusion of expenses of 168 million from acquisitions not applicable in the prior year a 97 million increase in compensation related expenses and a 32 million increase due to foreign currency exchange rates partially offset by decreased consulting fees cost of software developed for external sale subsequent to reaching technical feasibility were not considered material and were expensed as incurred

 overall research and development spending remained relatively constant at approximately 11 of revenues we expect to continue to devote resources to the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products we believe that research and development is critical to our strategic product development objectives and that to leverage our leading technology and to meet the changing requirements of our customers we will need to fund investments in several development projects in parallel 

sales and marketing expenses increased by 429 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 the increase was primarily due to the inclusion of expenses of 207 million from acquisitions not applicable in the prior period a 99 million increase in compensationrelated expenses a 43 million increase due to foreign currency exchange rates and a 34 million increase in marketing expenses spending overall remained relatively constant at approximately 15 of revenues

other operating expenses 

restructuring charges 

included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet is a restructuring accrual of 13 million as of december 28 2007 in conjunction with the acquisition of road we accrued 36 million for severance and benefits these restructuring costs were recorded in accordance with eitf 953 as part of the purchase price with no impact on our consolidated statements of income during fiscal 2007 we paid 23 million against this restructuring accrual the remaining restructuring accrual of 13 million is expected to be settled by the first half of fiscal 2008 

included in our consolidated statements of income for fiscal 2007 under “restructuring charges” is a restructuring cost of 30 million for charges associated with the acceleration of vesting of employee stock options for certain terminated road employees of the total amount 14 million was settled in cash and 16 million was recorded as shareholder’s equity 

there were no restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2006 restructuring charges of 03 million were recorded in fiscal 2005 primarily related to office closure costs due to integration efforts of the mensi acquisition 

inprocess research and development 

 

we recorded inprocess research and development iprd expenses of 21 million 19 million and 11 million related to acquisitions made in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively at the date of each acquisition the projects associated with the iprd efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no alternative future uses the value of the iprd was determined using a discounted cash flow model similar to the income approach focusing on the income producing capabilities of the inprocess technologies accordingly the value assigned to these iprd amounts were charged to expense on the respective acquisition date of each of the acquired companies 

 

amortization of purchased and other intangible assets 

 

total amortization expense of purchased and other intangible assets was 387 million in fiscal 2007 of which 198 million was recorded in cost of sales and 190 million was recorded in operating expenses total amortization expense of purchased and other intangibles represented 32 of revenue in fiscal 2007 an increase of 255 million from fiscal 2006 when it represented 14 of revenue the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of certain technology and patent intangibles as a result of acquisitions made in fiscal 2007 primarily road and to a lesser extent fiscal 2006 acquisition intangibles that included a full year of amortization expense in fiscal 2007 but only partial year amortization expense in fiscal 2006 due to the timing of the acquisitions 

total amortization expense of purchased and other intangibles represented 14 of revenue in fiscal 2006 an increase of 62 million from fiscal 2005 when it represented 09 of revenue the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of certain technology and patent intangibles as a result of acquisitions made in fiscal 2006 as well as fiscal 2005 acquisition intangibles that included a full year of amortization expense in fiscal 2006 but only partial year amortization expense in fiscal 2005 due to the timing of the acquisitions 

nonoperating income expense 

the following table shows nonoperating income expense for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions of those expenses below 

 

total nonoperating income expense decreased by 72 million during fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 of this decrease 60 million was due to higher interest expense due to an increase in debt associated with the road acquisition 31 million was due to a change in foreign currency transactions due to fluctuations in the us to canadian and euro currencies and these decreases were partially offset by increased profits from our ctct joint venture 

total nonoperating income expense increased by 129 million during fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 of this increase 47 million was due to higher interest income and lower interest expense as a result of interest income earned on higher cash balances and debt repaid in fiscal 2005 and also a 07 million increase in foreign currency transaction gains in addition expenses for joint ventures net increased by 73 million due a 52 million increase in income from joint ventures and the absence of 116 million of net transfer pricing expense with ctct that was included in fiscal 2005 but is now included in operating income partially offset by the recognition of a onetime deferred gain on the ctct joint venture of 93 million in fiscal 2005 

income tax provision 

our effective income tax rate for fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 was 36 30 and 32 respectively the 2007 rate was greater than the us federal statutory rate of 35 due to impacts resulting from sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” the 2006 rate was less than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to operations in foreign jurisdictions subject to an effective tax rate lower than the us and the extraterritorial income exclusion eti deduction the 2005 income tax rate was less than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to the benefit from the repatriation of undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings provided by the american jobs creation act of 2004 

litigation matters 

 from time to time we are involved in litigation arising out of the ordinary course of our business there are no known claims or pending litigation that are expected to have a material effect on our overall financial position results of operations or liquidity 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

other than lease commitments incurred in the normal course of business see contractual obligation table below we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities guarantee contracts retained or contingent interests in transferred assets or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity we do not have any majorityowned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements additionally we do not have any interest in or relationship with any special purpose entities 

in the normal course of business to facilitate sales of its products we indemnify other parties including customers lessors and parties to other transactions with the company with respect to certain matters we have agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties these agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with its officers and directors and the company’s bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents 

it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under these agreements were not material and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 28 2007 and december 29 2006 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

cash and cash equivalents 

as of december 28 2007 cash and cash equivalents totaled 1032 million compared to 1296 million at december 29 2006 we had debt of 607 million at december 28 2007 compared to 481000 at december 29 2006 

 our ability to continue to generate cash from operations will depend in large part on profitability the rate of collections of accounts receivable our inventory turns and our ability to manage other areas of working capital 

 we believe that our cash and cash equivalents together with our revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs and stock purchases under the stock repurchase program for at least the next twelve months 

 we anticipate that planned capital expenditures primarily for computer equipment software manufacturing tools and test equipment and leasehold improvements associated with business expansion will constitute a partial use of our cash resources decisions related to how much cash is used for investing are influenced by the expected amount of cash to be provided by operations 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 1870 million for fiscal 2007 as compared to 1358 million for fiscal 2006 this increase of 511 million was primarily driven by an increase in net income before noncash depreciation and amortization and increases in deferred revenue and income taxes payable this was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to increased revenue 

cash provided by operating activities was 1358 million for fiscal 2006 as compared to 924 million for fiscal 2005 this increase of 434 million was primarily driven by an increase in net income before stockbased compensation expense and associated excess tax benefits with the remainder due to working capital improvements in inventories and account receivables 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 3114 million for fiscal 2007 as compared to 1142 million for fiscal 2006 the increase was primarily attributable to cash used for the road acquisition 

cash used in investing activities was 1142 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to 744 million in fiscal 2005 the 398 million increase in spending was due to an increase of 485 million in cash used for acquisitions partially offset by a decrease of 69 million in capital equipment spending 

financing activities 

cash provided by financing activities was 1038 million for fiscal 2007 as compared to 342 million for fiscal 2006 primarily related to outstanding debt that was incurred for the road acquisition 

cash provided by financing activities was 342 million for fiscal 2006 compared to cash used of 134 million for fiscal 2005 the 476 million improvement was primarily due to a 383 million decrease in repayment of net debt and 88 million in excess tax benefits relating to stockbased compensation upon the exercise of stock options which were not present in fiscal 2005 

accounts receivable and inventory metrics 

 

accounts receivable days of sales outstanding were relatively flat at 70 days as of december 28 2007 as compared to 69 days as of december 30 2006 with a slight increase due to a larger percentage of international business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 our accounts receivable days of sales outstanding are calculated based on ending accounts receivable net divided by revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter times 91 days our inventory turns were at 43 for fiscal 2007 as compared to 41 for fiscal 2006 due to operational efficiencies our inventory turnover is based on the total cost of sales for the fiscal period over the average inventory for the corresponding fiscal period 

debt 

at the end of fiscal 2007 our total debt was comprised primarily of our term loan related to the acquisition of road in the amount of approximately 607 million as compared with approximately 481000 at the end of fiscal 2006 

on july 28 2005 we entered into a 200 million unsecured revolving credit agreement the 2005 credit facility with a syndicate of 10 banks with the bank of nova scotia as the administrative agent the funds available under the 2005 credit facility may be used for our general corporate purposes and up to 25 million of the 2005 credit facility may be used for letters of credit we incurred a commitment fee when the 2005 credit facility was not used the commitment fee is not material to our results during all periods presented 

on february 16 2007 the company amended and restated its existing 200 million unsecured revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of 11 banks with the bank of nova scotia as the administrative agent the 2007 credit facility under the 2007 credit facility the company exercised the option in the existing credit agreement to increase the availability under the revolving credit line by 100 million for an aggregate availability of up to 300 million and extended the maturity date of the revolving credit line by 18 months from july 2010 to february 2012 up to 25 million of the availability under the revolving credit line may be used to issue letters of credit and up to 20 million may be used for swing line loans in addition during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 the company incurred a fiveyear term loan under the 2007 credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 100 million which will mature concurrently with the revolving credit line the term loan will be repaid in quarterly installments with principal being amortized at the following annual rates year 1 at 10 year 2 at 15 year 3 at 15 year 4 at 20 year 5 at 20 and the last quarterly payment to be made at maturity together with a final payment of 20 the maximum leverage ratio under the 2007 credit facility is 3001 the funds available under the new 2007 credit facility may be used by the company for acquisitions stock repurchases and general corporate purposes for additional discussion of our debt see note 9 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

the company may borrow funds under the 2007 credit facility in us dollars or in certain other currencies and borrowings will bear interest at the companys option at either i a base rate based on the administrative agents prime rate plus a margin of between 0 and 0125 depending on the companys leverage ratio as of its most recently ended fiscal quarter or ii a reserveadjusted rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor euro interbank offered rate euribor stockholm interbank offered rate  stibor or other agreedupon rate depending on the currency borrowed plus a margin of between 0625 and 1125 depending on the companys leverage ratio as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter the companys obligations under the 2007 credit facility are guaranteed by certain of the companys domestic subsidiaries 

 

 

the 2007 credit facility contains customary affirmative negative and financial covenants including among other requirements negative covenants that restrict the companys ability to dispose of assets create liens incur indebtedness repurchase stock pay dividends make acquisitions make investments enter into mergers and consolidations and make capital expenditures within certain limitations and financial covenants that require the maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios the 2007 credit facility contains events of default that include among others nonpayment of principal interest or fees breach of covenants inaccuracy of representations and warranties cross defaults to certain other indebtedness bankruptcy and insolvency events material judgments and events constituting a change of control upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default interest on the obligations will accrue at an increased rate and the lenders may accelerate the companys obligations under the 2007 credit facility however that acceleration will be automatic in the case of bankruptcy and insolvency events of default as of december 28 2007 we were in compliance with all financial debt covenants 

 

 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 28 2007 

 

1 we may borrow funds under the 2007 credit facility in us dollars or in certain other currencies and will bear interest at our option at either i a base rate based on the administrative agents prime rate plus a margin of between 0 and 0125 depending on our leverage ratio as of its most recently ended fiscal quarter or ii a reserveadjusted rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor euro interbank offered rate euribor stockholm interbank offered rate stibor or other agreedupon rate depending on the currency borrowed plus a margin of between 0625 and 1125 depending on our leverage ratio as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter our obligations under the 2007 credit facility are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries we estimate the interest to be 50 per annum 

total debt consists of term loans of 600 million under our credit facilities and government loans of 07 million to foreign subsidiaries see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further financial information regarding longterm debt 

other purchase obligations and commitments represent open noncancelable purchase orders for material purchases with our vendors purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty our pension obligation which is not included in the table above is included in “other current liabilities” and “other noncurrent liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets additionally as of december 28 2007 we had acquisition earnouts of 76 million and holdbacks of 103 million recorded in “other current liabilities” and “other noncurrent liabilities” the maximum remaining payments including the 76 million and 103 million recorded will not exceed 715 million the remaining earnouts and holdbacks are payable through 2010 

we adopted fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” fin 48 on december 30 2006 a total of 284 million including interests and penalties represents the fin 48 liability at december 28 2007 at this time we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with tax authorities regarding this liability

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tableend 

we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors 

market interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents and shortterm investments consisted primarily of money market funds and certificate of deposits for fiscal 2007 and 2006 the main objective of these instruments was safety of principal and liquidity while maximizing return without significantly increasing risk 

   due to the shortterm nature of our cash equivalents and shortterm investments we do not anticipate any material effect on our portfolio due to fluctuations in interest rates 

we are exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing interest rates under our senior secured credit facilities our credit facilities are comprised of an unsecured revolving credit agreement with a maturity date of february 2012 and a fiveyear term loan which will mature concurrently with the revolving credit line we may borrow funds under the revolving credit agreement in us dollars or in certain other currencies and borrowings will bear interest at our option at either i a base rate based on the administrative agents prime rate plus a margin of between 0 and 0125 depending on our leverage ratio as of its most recently ended fiscal quarter or ii a reserveadjusted rate based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” euro interbank offered rate “euribor” stockholm interbank offered rate “ stibor” or other agreedupon rate depending on the currency borrowed plus a margin of between 0625 and 1125 depending on our leverage ratio as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter 

as of december 28 2007 we did not have an outstanding balance on the revolving credit lines and the worldwide outstanding principal balance on the term loan was 600 million a hypothetical 10 increase in the threemonth libor rates could result in approximately 03 million annual increase in interest expense on the existing principal balances 

 the hypothetical changes and assumptions made above will be different from what actually occurs in the future furthermore the computations do not anticipate actions that may be taken by our management should the hypothetical market changes actually occur over time as a result actual earnings effects in the future will differ from those quantified above 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain trade and intercompany receivables and payables primarily denominated in australian canadian japanese new zealand south african and swedish currencies the euro and the british pound these contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements as the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses on the forward contracts these instruments are marked to market through earnings every period and generally range from one to three months in original maturity we do not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for trading purposes 

foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of december 28 2007 and december 29 2006 are summarized as follows in thousands 

 

 we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position utilizing our current hedging strategy

we began operations in 1978 and incorporated in california in 1981 our common stock has been publicly traded on nasdaq since 1990 under the symbol trmb 

on january 17 2007 trimble’s board of directors approved a 2for1 split of all outstanding shares of the company’s common stock payable february 22 2007 to stockholders of record on february 8 2007 all shares and per share information presented has been adjusted to reflect the stock split on a retroactive basis for all periods presented 

technology overview 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from applying global navigation satellite system gnss technology to terrestrial applications the gnss includes a network of 24 orbiting us based satellites and associated ground control that is funded and maintained by the u s government and is available worldwide free of charge a russian satellite based system and the future european galileo system gnss positioning is based on a technique that precisely measures distances from four or more satellites the satellites continuously transmit precisely timed radio signals using extremely accurate atomic clocks a gnss receiver measures distances from the satellites in view by determining the travel time of a signal from the satellite to the receiver and then uses those distances to compute its position under normal circumstances a standalone gnss receiver is able to calculate its position at any point on earth in the earths atmosphere or in lower earth orbit to approximately 10 meters 24 hours a day much better accuracies are possible through a technique called “differential gnss” in addition to providing position gnss provides extremely accurate time measurement 

gnss accuracy is dependent upon the locations of the receiver and the number of gnss satellites that are above the horizon at any given time reception of gnss signals requires lineofsight visibility between the satellites and the receiver which can be blocked by buildings hills and dense foliage the receiver must have a line of sight to at least four satellites to determine its latitude longitude attitude angular orientation and time the accuracy of gnss may also be limited by distortion of gnss signals from ionospheric and other atmospheric conditions 

our gnss products are based on proprietary receiver technology over time the advances in positioning wireless communication and information technologies have enabled us to add more capability to our products and thereby deliver more value to our users for example the developments in wireless technology and deployments of next generation wireless networks have enabled less expensive wireless communications these developments allow for the efficient transfer of position data to locations away from the positioning field device allowing the data to be accessed by more users and thereby increasing productivity this has allowed us to include a wireless link in many of our products and connect remote field operations to a central location 

our laser and optical products either measure distances and angles to provide a position in three dimensional space or they provide highly accurate laser references from which position can be established the key element of these products is typically a laser which is generally a commercially available laser diode and a complex mechanical assembly these elements are augmented by software algorithms 

 

business strategy   

 

our business strategy is developed around an analysis of several key elements 

 

 

 

 

business segments and markets 

we are organized into four reporting segments encompassing our various applications and product lines engineering and construction field solutions mobile solutions and advanced devices our segments are distinguished by the markets they serve each segment consists of businesses which are responsible for product development marketing sales strategy and financial performance 

in the first quarter of 2006 trimble combined the operating results of the former components technologies and portfolio technologies segments and included the combined operating results in the advanced devices segment the change in presentation was made in recognition of the small size of each of the businesses relative to the total company the presentation of prior period’s segment operating results has been conformed to the company’s current segment presentation 

engineering and construction 

products in the engineering and construction segment improve productivity and accuracy throughout the entire construction process including the initial survey planning design site preparation and building phases our products are intended to both improve the productivity of each phase as well as facilitate the entire process by improving information flow from one step to the next 

the product solutions typically include multiple technologies the elements of these solutions may incorporate gps optical laser radio or cellular communications 

 

an example of the customer benefits provided by our product is our gps and robotic optical surveying instruments which enable the surveyor to perform operations in the field faster more reliably than conventional surveying instruments and with a smaller crew similarly our construction machine guidance products allow the operator to achieve the desired landform while eliminating stakeout and reducing rework these steps in the construction process can be readily linked together with data collection modules to minimize the time and effort required to maintain data accuracy throughout the entire construction process 

we sell and distribute our products in this segment through a global network of independent dealers that are supported by trimble personnel this channel is supplemented by relationships that create additional channel breadth including our joint ventures with caterpillar nikon and private branding arrangements with other companies 

we also design and market handheld data collectors and data collection software for field use by surveyors contractors and other professionals these products are sold directly through dealers and other survey manufacturers 

competitors in this segment are typically companies that provide optical laser or gps positioning products our principal competitors are topcon corporation and leica geosystems price points in this segment range from less than 1000 for certain laser systems to approximately 125000 for a highprecision threedimensional machine control system

risks and uncertainties 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k and in any other documents to which we refer you in this form 10k before purchasing our securities the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 

our inability to accurately predict orders and shipments may affect our revenue expenses and earnings per share  

we have not been able in the past to consistently predict when our customers will place orders and request shipments so that we cannot always accurately plan our manufacturing requirements as a result if orders and shipments differ from what we predict we may incur additional expenses and build excess inventory which may require additional reserves and allowances any significant change in our customers’ purchasing patterns could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and reported earnings per share for a particular quarter 

our operating results in each quarter may be affected by special conditions such as seasonality late quarter purchases weather and other potential issues 

due in part to the buying patterns of our customers a significant portion of our quarterly revenues occurs from orders received and immediately shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of each quarter although our operating expenses tend to remain fairly predictable engineering and construction purchases tend to occur in early spring and governmental agencies tend to utilize funds available at the end of the government’s fiscal year for additional purchases at the end of our third fiscal quarter in september of each year concentrations of orders sometimes also occur at the end of our other two fiscal quarters additionally a majority of our sales force earns commissions on a quarterly basis which may cause concentrations of orders at the end of any fiscal quarter if for any reason expected sales are deferred orders are not received or shipments are delayed a few days at the end of a quarter our operating results and reported earnings per share for that quarter could be significantly impacted 

we are dependent on a specific manufacturer and assembler for many of our products and on specific suppliers of critical parts for our products 

we are substantially dependent upon solectron corporation in california china and mexico as our preferred manufacturing partner for many of our gps products previously manufactured out of our sunnyvale facilities under the agreement with solectron we provide to solectron a twelvemonth product forecast and place purchase orders with solectron at least thirty calendar days in advance of the scheduled delivery of products to our customers depending on production lead time although purchase orders placed with solectron are cancelable the terms of the agreement would require us to purchase from solectron all inventory not returnable or usable by other solectron customers accordingly if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products we may be unable to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity from solectron to meet customers’ delivery requirements or we may accumulate excess inventories if such inventories are not usable by other solectron customers our current contract with solectron continues in effect until either party gives the other ninety days written notice  

in addition we rely on specific suppliers for a number of our critical components we have experienced shortages of components in the past our current reliance on specific or a limited group of suppliers involves several risks including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components and reduced control over pricing any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture such components internally could significantly delay our ability to ship our products which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our reputation and brand and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate 

our operating results have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control results in any period could be affected by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition demand for our products in any quarter or year may vary due to the seasonal buying patterns of our customers in the agricultural and engineering and construction industries due to the foregoing factors our operating results in one or more future periods are expected to be subject to significant fluctuations the price of our common stock could decline substantially in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors which are based primarily on historical models that are not necessarily accurate representations of the future 

our gross margin is subject to fluctuation 

our gross margin is affected by a number of factors including product mix product pricing cost of components foreign currency exchange rates and manufacturing costs for example sales of nikonbranded products generally have lower gross margins as compared to our gps survey products absent other factors a shift in sales towards nikonbranded products would lead to a reduction in our overall gross margins a decline in gross margin could potentially negatively impact our earnings per share 

failure to maintain effective internal controls in compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act could have an adverse effect on our business and stock price 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to include an internal control report of management in our annual report on form 10k for fiscal 2004 2005 and 2006 we satisfied the requirements of section 404 which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors addressing these assessments 

a system of controls however well designed and operated cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the system will be met in addition the design of a control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events because of the inherent limitations of control systems there is only reasonable assurance that our controls will succeed in achieving their stated goals under all potential future conditions 

we are dependent on new products 

our future revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to bring new products to market on a timely basis we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance of such products we may incur problems in the future in innovating and introducing new products our development stage products may not be successfully completed or if developed may not achieve significant customer acceptance if we were unable to successfully define develop and introduce competitive new products and enhance existing products our future results of operations would be adversely affected development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and we might not achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success a delay in new product introductions could have a significant impact on our results of operations 

we are dependent on proprietary technology 

our future success and competitive position is dependent upon our proprietary technology and we rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright law to protect our intellectual property the patents owned or licensed by us may be invalidated circumvented and challenged the rights granted under these patents may not provide competitive advantages to us any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us if at all 

others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology duplicate our technology or design around the patents owned by us in addition effective copyright patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in certain countries the steps taken by us to protect our technology might not prevent the misappropriation of such technology 

the value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many current patent filings we recognize that as new patents are issued or are brought to our attention by the holders of such patents it may be necessary for us to withdraw products from the market take a license from such patent holders or redesign our products we do not believe any of our products currently infringe patents or other proprietary rights of third parties but we cannot be certain they do not do so in addition the legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant expense of operations such events could have a material adverse effect on our revenues or profitability 

our products may contain errors or defects which could result in damage to our reputation lost revenues diverted development resources and increased service costs warranty claims and litigation 

 

our devices are complex and must meet stringent requirements we warrant that our products will be free of defect for various periods of time depending on the product in addition certain of our contracts include epidemic failure clauses if invoked these clauses may entitle the customer to return or obtain credits for products and inventory or to cancel outstanding purchase orders even if the products themselves are not defective 

we must develop our products quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing market and we have a history of frequently introducing new products products and services as sophisticated as ours could contain undetected errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new models or versions are released in general our products may not be free from errors or defects after commercial shipments have begun which could result in damage to our reputation lost revenues diverted development resources increased customer service and support costs and warranty claims and litigation which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are dependent on the availability of allocated bands within the radio frequency spectrum 

our gps technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service “sps” provided by the us government’s gps the gps sps operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union “itu” a specialized technical agency of the united nations these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference 

any itu reallocation of radio frequency bands including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products many of our products use other radio frequency bands together with the gps signal to provide enhanced gps capabilities such as realtime kinematic precision the continuing availability of these nongps radio frequencies is essential to provide enhanced gps products to our precision survey and construction machine controls markets any regulatory changes in spectrum allocation or in allowable operating conditions may cause a material adverse effect on our operating results 

in addition unwanted emissions from mobile satellite services and other equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or inband from licensed and unlicensed devices may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products the federal communications commission fcc continually receives proposals for novel technologies and services such as ultrawideband technologies which may seek to operate in or across the radio frequency bands currently used by the gps sps and other public safety services adverse decisions by the fcc that result in harmful interference to the delivery of the gps sps and other radio frequency spectrum also used in our products may result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

many of our products rely on gnss technology the gps and other satellite systems 

gnss technology gps satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage the satellites currently in orbit were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of 30 satellites in place some have already been in operation for more than 12 years to repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites a reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities 

in 2004 a presidential policy affirmed a 1996 presidential decision directive that marked the first time in the evolution of gps that access for civilian use was free of direct user fees in addition presidential policy has been complemented by corresponding legislation that was signed into law however there can be no assurance that the us government will remain committed to the operation and maintenance of gps satellites over a long period or that the policies of the us government for the use of gps without charge will remain unchanged because of everincreasing commercial applications of gps other us government agencies may become involved in the administration or the regulation of the use of gps signals any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select gpsbased systems instead of products based on competing technologies 

many of our products also use signals from systems that augment gps such as the wide area augmentation system waas and national differential gps system ndgps many of these augmentation systems are operated by the federal government and rely on continued funding and maintenance of these systems in addition some of our products also use satellite signals from the russian glonass system any curtailment of the operating capability of these systems could result in decreased user capability thereby impacting our markets 

the european governments have begun development of an independent satellite navigation system known as galileo we have access to the preliminary signal design which is subject to change although an operational galileo system is several years away if we are unable to develop a timely commercial product it may have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 

we may be materially affected by new regulatory requirements 

 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations including the handling and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous wastes and emissions and discharges into the environment failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action penalties or the imposition of other liabilities 

in particular under certain of these laws and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of remediating hazardous substances or petroleum products on or from its property without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination as well as incur liability to third parties impacted by such contamination in addition we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and upcoming requirements relating to the materials composition of many of our products the european union “eu” adopted new directives to manage the use of hazardous materials and to facilitate the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment sold in the eu one of these is the restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment “rohs” directive the rohs directive restricts the use of lead mercury and certain other substances in electrical and electronic products placed on the market in the european union after july 1 2006 

china adopted the management measures on electronic information product pollution control to manage toxic and hazardous substances in electronic information products in 2006 also known as “china rohs” the new regulations will require labeling of products containing toxic or hazardous substances placed on the chinese market after march 1 2007 similar laws and regulations have been or may be enacted in other regions including in the united states and japan other environmental regulations may require us to reengineer our products to utilize components which are more environmentally compatible and such reengineering and component substitution may result in additional costs to us although we do not anticipate any material adverse effects based on the nature of our operations and the effect of such laws there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war or terrorism 

acts of war or acts of terrorism could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruption to our economy and create further uncertainties to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the us and as such we face exposure to movements in nonus currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows fluctuation in currency impacts our operating results 

currently we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our net income 

we face risks in investing in and integrating new acquisitions 

we have recently acquired a number of companies including road and intend to continue to acquire other companies acquisitions of companies entail numerous risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a result of such acquisitions we have significant assets that include goodwill and other purchased intangibles the testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines for impairment requires significant use of judgment and assumptions changes in business conditions could require adjustments to the valuation of these assets in addition losses incurred by a company in which we have an investment may have a direct impact on our financial statements or could result in our having to writedown the value of such investment any such problems in integration or adjustments to the value of the assets acquired could harm our growth strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and compliance with debt covenants 

our debt could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 

upon consummation of the road acquisition on february 20 2007 we borrowed 250 million under an amended credit agreement and term loan which has increased our outstanding indebtedness and interest expense our debt could have important consequences such as 

 

 

 

 

additionally if we were to default under our amended credit agreement and were unable to obtain a waiver for such a default interest on the obligations would accrue at an increased rate and the lenders could accelerate our obligations under the amended credit agreement however that acceleration will be automatic in the case of bankruptcy and insolvency events of default additionally our subsidiaries that have guaranteed the amended credit agreement could be required to pay the full amount of our obligations under the amended credit agreement any such action on the part of the lenders against us could have a materially adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to enter into or maintain important alliances 

we believe that in certain business opportunities our success will depend on our ability to form and maintain alliances with industry participants such as caterpillar nikon and cnh global our failure to form and maintain such alliances or the preemption of such alliances by actions of competitors or us will adversely affect our ability to penetrate emerging markets no assurances can be given that we will not experience problems from current or future alliances or that we will realize value from any such strategic alliances 

we face competition in our markets 

our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price quality and performance of our products the level of customer service the development of new technology and our ability to participate in emerging markets within each of our markets we encounter direct competition from other gps optical and laser suppliers and competition may intensify from various larger us and nonus competitors and new market entrants particularly from emerging markets such as china and india some of which may be our current customers the competition in the future may in some cases result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the future against existing and additional competitors will depend largely on our ability to execute our strategy to provide systems and products with significantly differentiated features compared to currently available products we may not be able to implement this strategy successfully and our products may not be competitive with other technologies or products that may be developed by our competitors many of whom have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing sales and other resources than we do 

we must carefully manage our future growth 

growth in our sales or continued expansion in the scope of our operations could strain our current management financial manufacturing and other resources and may require us to implement and improve a variety of operating financial and other systems procedures and controls we have recently implemented a new enterprise resource planning software system and we may experience in our financial and order management processing as a result of new procedures problems associated with any improvement or expansion of these systems procedures or controls may adversely affect our operations and these systems procedures or controls may not be designed implemented or improved in a costeffective and timely manner any failure to implement improve and expand such systems procedures and controls in a timely and efficient manner could harm our growth strategy and adversely affect our financial condition and ability to achieve our business objectives 

we are subject to the impact of governmental and other similar certifications 

we market certain products that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold for example ce certification for radiated emissions is required for most gps receiver and data communications products sold in the european union an inability to obtain such certifications in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our operating results also some of our products that use integrated radio communication technology require product type certification and some products require an end user to obtain licensing from the fcc for frequencyband usage these are secondary licenses that are subject to certain restrictions an inability or delay in obtaining such certifications or changes to the rules by the fcc could adversely affect our ability to bring our products to market which could harm our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to the adverse impact of radio frequency congestion 

we have certain products such as gps rtk systems and surveying and mapping systems that use integrated radio communication technology requiring access to available radio frequencies allocated by the fcc or the ntia in the case of federal government users of this equipment for which the end user is required to obtain a license in order to operate their equipment in addition access to these frequencies by state agencies is under management by state radio communications coordinators some bands are experiencing congestion that excludes their availability for access by state agencies in some states to reduce congestion the fcc announced that it will require migration of radio technology from wideband to narrowband operations in these bands the rules require migration of users to narrowband channels by 2011 in the meantime congestion could cause fcc coordinators to restrict or refuse licenses an inability to obtain access to these radio frequencies by end users could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect your investment in our common stock 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile during fiscal 2006 our stock price ranged from 1751 to 2618 on a postsplit basis we believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate perhaps substantially including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of hightech companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the market price of our common stock may decline 

 

provisions in our charter documents and under california law could prevent or delay a change of control which could reduce the market price of our common stock 

certain provisions of our articles of incorporation as amended and restated our bylaws as amended and restated and the california general corporation law may be deemed to have an antitakeover effect and could discourage a third party from acquiring or make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without approval of our board of directors these provisions could also limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock certain provisions allow the board of directors to authorize the issuance of preferred stock with rights superior to those of the common stock 

we have adopted a preferred shares rights agreement commonly known as a poison pill the provisions described above our poison pill and provisions of the california general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us

 item 7 man age ments discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that reflect our plans estimates and beliefs our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and those listed under risks factors 

executive level overview 

trimble’s focus is on combining positioning technology with wireless communication and application capabilities to create systemlevel solutions that enhance productivity and accuracy for our customers the majority of our markets are enduser markets including engineering and construction firms governmental organizations public safety workers farmers and companies who must manage fleets of mobile workers and assets in our advanced devices segment we also provide components to original equipment manufacturers to incorporate into their products in the end user markets we provide a system that includes a hardware platform that may contain software and customer support some examples of our solutions include products that automate and simplify the process of surveying land products that automate the utilization of equipment such as tractors and bulldozers products that enable a company to manage its mobile workforce and assets and products that allow municipalities to manage their fixed assets 

solutions targeted at the enduser make up a significant majority of our revenue to create compelling products we must attain an understanding of the end users’ needs and work flow and how locationbased technology can enable that end user to work faster more efficiently and more accurately we use this knowledge to create highly innovative products that change the way work is done by the enduser with the exception of our tms segment our products are generally sold through a dealer channel and it is crucial that we maintain a proficient global thirdparty distribution channel 

during 2006 we continued to execute our strategy with a series of actions that can be summarized in four categories 

reinforcing our position in existing markets 

generally we believe that our markets provide us with additional substantial potential for substituting our technology for traditional methods in 2006 we continued to develop new products and to strengthen our distribution channels to realize these opportunities a number of new products such as trimble s6 trimble sps700 robotic construction total station and the enhanced trimble gcs900 grade control system strengthened our competitive position and created new value for the user 

extend our position in existing markets through new product categories 

we are utilizing the strength of the trimble brand in our markets to expand our revenues by bringing new products to existing users a 2006 example was the introduction of the aggps ezboom 2010 product in order to create new categories of products on the construction site we acquired quantm meridian xyz solutions and bitwyse 

bring existing technology to new markets 

 we continue to reinforce our position in existing markets and positioned ourselves in newer markets that will serve as important sources of future growth our efforts in china india russia korea and eastern europe all reflected improving financial results with the promise of more in the future 

entered completely new markets 

in fiscal 2006 we acquired visual statement which provides desktop software tools for crime and collision incident investigation analysis and reconstitution as well as statewide enterprise solutions for reporting and analysis used by public safety agencies and eleven technology inc which is a mobile application software company with a leading position in the consumer packaged goods industry in addition we increased our reach with existing products in new markets particularly emerging markets such as china and india 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements we consider the accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting polices these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

revenue recognition 

our revenues are recorded in accordance with the securities and exchange commission’s sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 104 “revenue recognition” and in accordance with statement of position sop no 972 “software revenue recognition” and statement of position sop no 989 “modification of sop 972” the company recognizes product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer or is uncertain revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 

contracts and customer purchase orders are typically used to determine the existence of an arrangement shipping documents and customer acceptance when applicable are used to verify delivery we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis as well as the customer’s payment history 

our shipment terms for us orders and international orders fulfilled from its european distribution center are typically fca free carrier shipping point except certain sales to us government agencies which are shipped fob destination fca shipping point means that we fulfill the obligation and title has passed to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the carrier named by the buyer at the named place or point if no precise point is indicated by the buyer we may choose within the place or range stipulated where the carrier will take the goods into carrier’s charge fob destination means revenue for orders are not recognized until the product is delivered and title has transferred to the buyer we bear all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods up to that point shipping and handling costs are included in the cost of goods sold 

revenue to distributors and resellers is recognized upon delivery assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met distributors and resellers do not have a right of return 

revenues from purchased extended warranty and support agreements are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the warrantysupport period 

we apply statement of position sop no 972 “software revenue recognition” to products where the embedded software is more than incidental to the functionality of the hardware this determination requires significant judgment including a consideration of factors such as marketing research and development efforts and any postcustomer contract support relating to the embedded software 

in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue 0021 “accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” when a nonsoftware sale involves multiple elements the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each element are met 

our software arrangements generally consist of a perpetual license fee and post contract customer support pcs we have established vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for our pcs contracts based on the renewal rate the remaining value of the software arrangement is allocated to the license fee using the residual method which revenue is primarily recognized when the software has been delivered and there are no remaining obligations revenue from pcs is recognized ratably over the term of the pcs agreement 

allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns 

our accounts receivable balance net of allowance for doubtful accounts was 1720 million as of december 29 2006 compared with 1451 million as of december 30 2005 we evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors such as age of the accounts receivable balances credit quality historical experience and current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us a specific allowance for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 

a reserve for sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates experienced in the ordinary course of business the reserve for sales returns as of december 29 2006 and december 30 2005 were 900000 and 15 million respectively for estimated future returns that were recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established our revenue could be adversely affected 

inventory valuation 

our inventories net balance was 1126 million as of december 29 2006 compared with 1079 million as of december 30 2005 our inventory allowances as of december 29 2006 were 286 million compared with 232 million as of december 30 2005 our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with costs primarily computed on a standard cost basis adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value if required are made for estimated excess obsolescence or impaired inventory factors influencing these adjustments include decline in demand technological changes product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues if actual factors are less favorable than those projected by us additional inventory writedowns may be required 

income taxes 

 

income taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred tax assets or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized 

the company’s valuation allowance is attributable to primarily the california research credit and acquisition net operating loss carryforwards valuation allowance amounts are offsets to related deferred tax assets management believes that it is more likely than not that the company will not realize these deferred tax assets and accordingly a valuation allowance has been established for such amounts when the tax credits are utilized and the valuation allowance is released the benefit of the release of the valuation allowance will be accounted for as a credit to shareholder’s equity rather than as a reduction of the income tax provision  

 

annual goodwill impairment test 

goodwill as of december 29 2006 was 3745 million compared with 2861 million as of december 30 2005 the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant assumptions if an evaluation is required the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets would be compared to their carrying amount to determine if a writedown to fair market value or discounted cash flow value is required 

we performed an annual impairment test of goodwill at the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2006 and 2005 and found there was no impairment of goodwill we will continue to evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at the end of each fiscal third quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the determination of the net carrying value of goodwill and the extent to which if any there is impairment are dependent on material estimates and judgments on our part including the useful life over which the intangible assets are to be amortized and the estimates of the value of future net cash flows which are based upon further estimates of future revenues expenses and operating income 

accounting for longlived assets including intangibles subject to amortization 

depreciation and amortization of our longlived assets is provided using straightline methods over their estimated useful lives changes in circumstances such as technological advances changes to our business model or changes in the capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from initial estimates in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a longlived asset should be revised we will depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value over its revised remaining useful life factors such as changes in the planned use of equipment customer attrition contractual amendments or mandated regulatory requirements could result in shortened useful lives 

longlived assets and asset groups are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable the estimated future cash flows are based upon among other things assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows longlived assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value in the period in which the determination is made 

warranty costs 

the liability for product warranties was 86 million as of december 29 2006 compared with 75 million as of december 30 2005 we accrue for warranty costs as part of cost of sales based on associated material product costs technical support labor costs and costs incurred by third parties performing work on our behalf our expected future cost is primarily estimated based upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment the products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to three years and in some instances up to 55 years 

while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates revisions to the estimated warranty accrual and related costs may be required 

stock compensation 

we apply standard of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans and stock purchase plan for fiscal 2006 as a result the company’s financial statements for fiscal 2006 include stockbased compensation expenses that are not comparable to financial statements prior to fiscal 2006 prior to fiscal 2006 we applied accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 25 and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans and stock purchase plan accordingly we did not recognize compensation cost for stock options granted at a price equal to fair market value prior to fiscal 2006 

for options granted prior to october 1 2005 the fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model for stock options granted on or after october 1 2005 the fair value of each award is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial valuation model similar to the blackscholes model the binomial model takes into account variables such as volatility dividend yield rate and risk free interest rate in addition   the binomial model incorporates actual optionpricing behavior for these reasons we believe that the binomial model provides a fair value that is more representative of actual experience and future expected experience than the value calculated using the blackscholes model 

note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements describes the plans we operate and note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the effects to reported net income and earnings per share for fiscal 2006 and pro forma net income and earnings per share for fiscal 2005 and 2004 as if we had elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value of the options granted at grant date

results of operations 

overview 

the following table is a summary of revenue gross margin and operating income for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

 

 

basis of presentation 

we have a 5253 week fiscal year ending on the friday nearest to december 31 which for fiscal 2006 was december 29 2006 fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 were 52week years 

revenue 

in fiscal 2006 total revenue increased by 1653 million or 21 to 9402 million from 7749 million in fiscal 2005 the increase in fiscal 2006 was primarily due to stronger performances across all our operating segments the engineering and construction field solutions mobile solutions and advanced devices segments increased 21 9 93 and 13 respectively compared to fiscal 2005 revenue growth within these segments was driven by new product introductions increased penetration of existing markets and geographical expansion mobile solutions growth in particular benefited from the prior year acquisitions overall 2006 acquisitions impacted total company revenue growth by approximately 2 

in fiscal 2005 total revenue increased by 1061 million or 16 to 7749 million from 6688 million in fiscal 2004 the increase in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to stronger performances across all our operating segments with the exception of component technologies the engineering and construction field solutions and mobile solutions segments increased 19 21 and 34 respectively compared to fiscal 2004 revenue growth within these segments was driven by new product introductions and increased penetration of existing markets both the engineering and construction and mobile solutions operating segments also benefited from the impact of the pacific crest apache and mobiletech acquisitions 

 during the 2006 fiscal year sales to customers in the united states represented 54 europe represented 25 asia pacific represented 12 and other regions represented 9 of our total revenues during the 2005 fiscal year sales to customers in the united states represented 54 europe represented 25 asia pacific represented 11 and other regions represented 10 of our total revenues we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to account for a major portion of our revenues 

 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 it is possible however that in future periods the failure of one or more large customers to purchase products in quantities anticipated by us may adversely affect the results of operations 

gross margin 

our gross margin varies due to a number of factors including product mix pricing distribution channel used effects of production volumes new product startup costs and foreign currency translations in fiscal 2006 our gross margin increased by 713 million as compared to fiscal 2005 due to higher revenue and the success of higher margin products including survey and machine control products and higher subscription revenues the increase was partially offset by decreases due to the impact of the reclassification of the ctct transactions of 181 million previously recorded in nonoperating expenses amortization of softwarerelated purchased intangibles of 52 million and stockbased compensation expense of 12 million that were not included in gross margin during the same period in fiscal 2005 gross margin as a percentage of total revenues was 49 in fiscal 2006 and 50 in fiscal 2005 the 1 decrease in the gross margin percentage was driven by a decrease of 3 due to the ctct impact amortization of purchased intangibles and stockbased compensation offset by an increase of 2 due to higher margin products and subscription revenues 

in fiscal 2005 our gross margin increased by 650 million due to due to higher revenue and success of our market segmentation strategy higher service revenues cost reductions and introduction of higher margin products gross margin as a percentage of total revenues was 50  in fiscal 2005 and 49 in fiscal 2004 

 because of potential product mix changes within and among the industry markets market pressures on unit selling prices fluctuations in unit manufacturing costs including increases in component prices and other factors current level gross margins cannot be assured 

operating income 

operating income increased by 104 million for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 due to higher revenues and the success of higher margin products offset by decreases due to the impact of the reclassification of the ctct transactions previously recorded in nonoperating expenses and stockbased compensation expense that was not included in operating income during the same period in fiscal 2005 

 

operating income as a percentage of total revenue was 14 for fiscal 2006 compared to 16 in fiscal 2005   the 2 decrease in operating income was due to a 4 ctct transaction reclassification impact amortization of purchased intangibles increased acquisition expenses and stockbased compensation impact partially offset by 2 increase driven by gross margin expansion 

operating income increased by 393 million for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 operating income as a percentage of total revenue was 16 as compared to 13 in fiscal 2004 the increase was due to improvement in revenues along with gross margins and greater leverage of operating expenses operating expenses represented 34 of total revenue in fiscal 2005 as compared to 36 in fiscal 2004 

results by segment 

to achieve distribution marketing production and technology advantages in our targeted markets we manage our operations in the following four segments engineering and construction field solutions mobile solutions and advanced devices operating income loss equals net revenue less cost of sales and operating expenses excluding general corporate expenses amortization of purchased intangibles inprocess research and development expenses restructuring charges nonoperating income expense and income taxes 

in the first fiscal quarter of 2006 we combined the operating results of the former component technologies and portfolio technologies segments and included the combined operating results in the advanced devices segment the change in presentation was made in recognition of the small size of each of the businesses relative to the total company the presentation of prior period’s segment operating results has been changed to conform to our current segment presentation 

 

 

the following table is a breakdown of revenue and operating income by segment for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

 

 

 

 

a reconciliation of our consolidated segment operating income to consolidated income before income taxes follows 

 

engineering and construction 

engineering and construction revenues increased by 1127 million or 21 while segment operating income increased by 182 million or 15 for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 the revenue growth was driven by the continued strength in survey products as well as increased sales of machine control products aggressive marketing programs and geographic expansion segment operating income increased as a result of higher revenues and increased sales of higher margin products partially offset by 57 million in expenses related to ctct transactions 40 million in stockbased compensation expense that were not present in the corresponding period of fiscal 2005 

engineering and construction revenues increased by 840 million or 19 while segment operating income increased by 385 million or 48 for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 the revenue growth was driven by the introduction of products such as the trimble s6 and machine control products and growth of existing products such as the trimble r8 gps system revenue growth was also attributed to the acquisitions for fiscal 2005 segment operating income increased as a result of higher revenues and increased sales of higher margin products 

field solutions 

field solutions revenues increased by approximately 114 million or 9 while segment operating income increased by 49 million or 15 for fiscal year 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 revenue increased primarily due growth in our gis business in gis growth was due to new products and a continuing shift to a higher value differentiated distribution channel the agricultural business remained stable as compared to the prior year due to a steady agricultural market operating income increased primarily due to strong operating leverage and increased revenue partially offset by the inclusion of stockbased compensation that was not present in the corresponding periods of fiscal 2005 

field solutions revenues increased by approximately 223 million or 21 while segment operating income increased by 74 million or 29 for fiscal year 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 revenue increased primarily due to successful new products such as the ag gps ezguide system and ag gps ezsteer system in our agriculture product line and as a result of higher demand for both automated and manual guidance products into the agricultural market operating income increased primarily due to increased revenue and associated gross margins 

mobile solutions 

mobile solutions revenues increased by 294 million or 93 while segment operating income increased by 56 million or 183 for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 revenue increased due to increased subscriber growth an increase in recurring subscription revenues the benefit of acquisitions especially mobiletech and entry into new vertical markets operating income increased primarily due to higher subscription revenue and associated gross margins partially offset by the inclusion of stockbased compensation that was not present in fiscal 2005 

mobile solutions revenues increased by 80 million or 34 in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 due to increased subscriber growth an increase in sales into the readymix suppliers and increased sales from our dealer channel as we continue to develop and extend this channel operating loss decreased by 29 million or 49 in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 primarily attributable to an increase in revenues and increase in gross margins due higher recurring service revenue 

advanced devices 

advanced devices revenues increased by 118 million or 13 while segment operating income decreased by 31 million or 24 for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 the increase in revenue was primarily due to stronger performance in our embedded and airborne products as well as licensing revenues associated with a nokia intellectual property agreement signed in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 operating income decreased for fiscal 2006 due to sales of lower gross margin products a reduction in revenue in our military and advanced systems product line increased costs related to the trimtrac product line and inclusion of stockbased compensation that were not present in the corresponding periods of fiscal 2005 partially offset by stronger embedded and airborne product revenue and intellectual property licensing revenue 

advanced devices revenues decreased by 81 million or 8 while segment operating income decreased by 55 million or 30 for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 the decrease in revenue and operating income were primarily due to the decline in demand for our invehicle navigation products as a result of changes in buying strategies among certain automotive manufacturers and softness in the timing business which was offset by a stronger performance in our applanix airborne business 

research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 

the following table shows research and development “rd” sales and marketing and general and administrative “ga” expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues for the fiscal years ended 2006 2005 and 2004 and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions of those operating expenses below 

 

overall rd sales and marketing and ga expenses increased by approximately 593 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

research and development expenses increased by 196 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the inclusion of expenses of 46 million from acquisitions not applicable in the prior year 49 million increase in compensation related expenses 26 million in stockbased compensation expense not present in fiscal 2005 and 23 million increase in rd materials primarily due to compliance with the european lead free initiative all of our rd costs have been expensed as incurred cost of software developed for external sale subsequent to reaching technical feasibility were not considered material and were expensed as incurred 

research and development expenses increased by 67 million in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to the inclusion of expenses from acquisitions not applicable in the prior year in the amount of 28 million and increase in compensation of 28 million 

 overall research and development spending remained relatively constant at approximately 11 of revenues we expect to continue to devote resources to the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products we believe that research and development is critical to our strategic product development objectives and that to leverage our leading technology and meet the changing requirements of our customers we will need to fund investments in several development projects in parallel 

sales and marketing expenses increased by 234 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 the increase was primarily due the inclusion of expenses from acquisitions not applicable in the prior period in the amount of 75 million 80 million increase in compensation related expenses 28 million in stockbased compensation expense not present in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and 19 million in customer trade show expenses due to increased size and attendance at the shows spending overall remained relatively constant at approximately 15 of revenues 

sales and marketing expenses increased by 122 million in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 but decreased as a percent of total revenues the increase was primarily due to advertising and promotion costs associated with the launch of new products of 54 million the inclusion of expenses from acquisitions not applicable in the prior year of 15 million increase in travel expenses of 14 million and an increase in compensation of 17 million 

 we intend to continue to focus and expand our sales and marketing efforts across all the geographies and markets we serve in order to increase market awareness of our products and to better support our existing customers worldwide our future growth will depend in part on the timely development and continued viability of the markets in which we currently compete as well as our ability to continue to identify and exploit new markets for our products 

general and administrative expenses increased by 163 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the inclusion of expenses from acquisitions not applicable in the prior year of 43 million 39 million increase in compensationrelated expenses and 60 million in stockbased compensation expense not present in fiscal 2005 spending overall remained relatively constant at approximately 7 of revenues 

general and administrative expenses increased by 74 million in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to an increase in compensation expense of 59 million increase in rent expense of 10 million as we were making duplicate payments during our move to our new headquarters the inclusion of expenses from acquisitions not applicable in the prior year of 18 million and increase of 08 million in patent expense this was partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of 17 million 

other operating expenses 

restructuring charges 

there were no restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2006 restructuring charges of 03 million and 06 million were recorded in fiscal years 2005 and 2004 respectively the charges in fiscal 2005 were primarily related to office closure costs due to integration efforts of the mensi acquisition the charges in fiscal 2004 were primarily related to severance costs due to the realignment of trimble mobile solutions inc as a result of the realignment the headcount decreased by 36 in fiscal 2004 as of december 29 2006 an accrual balance of 01 million related to the fiscal 2005 office closure is expected to be paid over the next several years 

inprocess research and development 

 

we recorded inprocess research and development iprd expense of 19 million and 11 million related to acquisitions made in fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively we did not record any iprd expense in fiscal 2004 at the date of each acquisition the projects associated with the iprd efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no alternative future uses the value of the iprd was determined using a discounted cash flow model similar to the income approach focusing on the income producing capabilities of the inprocess technologies accordingly the value assigned to these iprd amounts were charged to expense on the respective acquisition date of each of the acquired companies 

 

amortization of purchased and other intangible assets 

 

total amortization expense of purchased and other intangible assets was 133 million in fiscal 2006 of which 54 million was recorded in cost of sales and 79 million was recorded in operating expenses total amortization expense of purchased and other intangibles represented 14 of revenue in fiscal 2006 an increase of 62 million from fiscal 2005 when it represented 09 of revenue the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of certain technology and patent intangibles as a result of acquisitions made in fiscal 2006 as well as fiscal 2005 acquisition intangibles that included a full year of amortization expense in fiscal 2006 but only partial year amortization expense in fiscal 2005 due to the timing of the acquisitions 

amortization expense of purchased and other intangibles represented 09 of revenue in fiscal 2005 a decrease of 15 million from fiscal 2004 when it represented 13 of revenue although there were acquisitions in fiscal 2005 amortization expense decreased due to the fact our spectra precision group intangibles were fully amortized in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 

nonoperating expense net 

the following table shows nonoperating expense net for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions of those expenses below 

 

nonoperating income net increased by 129 million during fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 of this increase 47m was due to higher interest income and lower interest expense as a result of interest income earned on higher cash balances and debt repaid in fiscal 2005 and also a 07 million increase in foreign currency transaction gains in addition expenses for affiliated operations net increased by 73 million due a 52 million increase in income from affiliated operations and the absence of 116 million of net transfer pricing expense with ctct that was included in fiscal 2005 but is now included in operating income partially offset by the recognition of a onetime deferred gain on the ctct joint venture of 93 million in fiscal 2005 

nonoperating expense net decreased by 105 million during fiscal 2005 as compared with fiscal 2004 primarily due to a decrease in net interest expense of 20 million as a result of the repayment of debt and interest earned on higher cash balances offset by a 09 million writeoff of debt issuance costs relating to the 2003 credit facility an increase of 19 million in foreign currency transaction gain and a 73 million decrease in expenses for affiliated operations as a result of increased profits from our joint ventures and recognition of the remaining deferred gain from the caterpillar joint venture this was partially offset by a decrease in other income primarily due to the absence of a nonrecurring gain in investments of approximately 10 million in fiscal year 2004 

income tax provision 

our effective income tax rate for fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 was 30 32 and 10 respectively the 2006 rate was less that the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to operations in foreign jurisdictions subject to an effective tax rate lower than the us and extraterritorial income exclusion eti deduction    the 2005 income tax rate was less that the us federal statutory rate primarily due to the benefit from the repatriation of undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings provided by the american jobs creation act of 2004 the 2004 income tax rate was less than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the realization of benefits from net operating losses and other previously reserved deferred tax assets 

litigation matters 

 from time to time we are involved in litigation arising out of the ordinary course of our business there are no known claims or pending litigation that are expected to have a material effect on our overall financial position results of operations or liquidity 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

other than lease commitments incurred in the normal course of business see contractual obligation table below we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities guarantee contracts retained or contingent interests in transferred assets or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity we do not have any majorityowned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements additionally we do not have any interest in or relationship with any special purpose entities 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

cash and cash equivalents 

our financial condition further strengthened as cash and cash equivalents totaled 1296 million at december 29 2006 compared to 739 million at december 30 2005 we essentially had no debt at december 29 2006 and december 20 2005 

in fiscal 2006 cash provided by operating activities was 1381 million compared to 929 million in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2005 this increase of 452 million was primarily driven by a 228 million increase in net income before stockbased compensation expense and associated excess tax benefits with the remainder due to working capital improvements in inventories and account receivables 

our accounts receivable days of sales outstanding improved to 55 days at the end of fiscal 2006 from 66 days at the end of fiscal 2005 the decrease is primarily due to increased collection efforts and improvement in monitoring of outstanding receivables in addition in the first quarter of 2006 the company established a dealer floor plan financing program in the us and canada through a nonrecourse financing facility our accounts receivable days of sales outstanding is based upon the latest month revenues plus any uncollected accounts receivable from prior months’ revenues calculated into days our inventory turns were at 41 for fiscal 2006 as compared to 39 for fiscal 2005 our inventory turnover is based on the total cost of sales for the fiscal period over the average inventory for the corresponding fiscal period 

in fiscal 2005 cash provided by operating activities was 929 million as compared to 746 million in fiscal 2004 the increase of 183 million was primarily driven by the 172 million increase in net income during fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 our ability to continue to generate cash from operations will depend in large part on profitability the rate of collections of accounts receivable our inventory turns and our ability to manage other areas of working capital our accounts receivable days for sales outstanding increased from 63 days at the end of fiscal 2004 to 66 days at the end of fiscal 2005 the increase is due to acquisitions delayed payments from some government contracts and past due accounts from a couple of key customers our inventory turns was unchanged at 40 at the end of fiscal 2005 and 2004 

cash used in investing activities was 1164 million in fiscal 2006 compared to 749 million in fiscal 2005 the 415 million increase in spending was due to an increase of 485 million in cash used for acquisitions partially offset by a decrease of 69 million in capital equipment spending 

cash used in investing activities was 749 million in fiscal 2005 as compared to 251 million in fiscal 2004 the 498 million increase was primarily due to an increase of 400 million in cash used for acquisitions and an increase of 106 million in investment in capital equipment of which 66 million was related to the relocation of our sunnyvale headquarters 

cash provided from financing activities was 342 million for fiscal 2006 compared to cash used of 134 million in fiscal 2005 the 476 million improvement was primarily due to a 383 million decrease in repayment of net debt 88 million in excess tax benefits relating to stockbased compensation upon the exercise of stock options which were not present in fiscal 2005 and a 21 million increase in proceeds received from issuance of common stock 

cash used in financing activities was 134 million in fiscal 2005 as compared to 242 million in fiscal 2004 the 108 million decrease was primarily due to a 129 million decrease in repayment of net debt as we repaid our entire debt balance in the second fiscal quarter of 2005 this was partially offset by a 23 million decrease in proceeds received from issuance of common stock and warrants 

 we believe that our cash and cash equivalents together with our credit facilities 200 million as of december 29 2006 will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months 

 we anticipate that planned capital expenditures primarily for computer equipment software manufacturing tools and test equipment and leasehold improvements associated with business expansion  will constitute a partial use of our cash resources decisions related to how much cash is used for investing are influenced by the expected amount of cash to be provided by operations 

 additionally on february 16 2007 we acquired road which was funded through cash of trimble and a new debt financing arrangement post acquisition expenditures will be funded through anticipated positive cash flow from operations the positive cash flow from operations is a result of our belief that we will be able to manage our assets efficiently and achieve our overall financial projections

tableend 

we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors 

market interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents and shortterm investments consisted primarily of money market funds and certificate of deposits for fiscal 2006 and 2005 the main objective of these investments was safety of principal and liquidity while maximizing return without significantly increasing risk 

 due to the shortterm nature of our cash equivalents and shortterm investments we do not anticipate any material effect on our portfolio due to fluctuations in interest rates 

 

we may be exposed to market risk in the event we borrow against our 2005 credit facility borrowings under the 2005 credit facility have interest payments based on a floating rate of libor plus a number of basis points tied to a formula based on our leverage ratio the 2005 credit facility had outstanding principal balances of zero as of december 29 2006 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain trade and intercompany receivables and payables primarily denominated in australian canadian japanese new zealand south african and swedish currencies the euro and the british pound these contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements as the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses on the forward contracts these instruments are marked to market through earnings every period and generally range from one to three months in original maturity we do not enter into foreign exchange forward contract for trading purposes 

foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of december 29 2006 and december 30 2005 are summarized as follows in thousands

 item 1   business overview 

trimble navigation limited a california corporation “trimble” or “the company” or “we” or “our” or “us” provides advanced positioning product solutions most typically to commercial and government users the principle applications served include surveying agriculture machine guidance asset and fleet management and telecommunications infrastructure our products typically provide benefits that can include lower operational costs and higher productivity examples of products include systems that guide agricultural and construction equipment surveying instruments systems that track fleets of vehicles and data collection systems that enable the management of large amounts of georeferenced information in addition we also manufacture components for in vehicle navigation and telematics systems and timing modules used in the synchronization of wireless networks 

trimble products often combine knowledge of location or position together with a wireless link to provide a solution to a specific application position is provided through a number of alternative technologies including the global positioning system gps and systems that use laser or optical technologies to establish position wireless communication techniques include both public networks such as cellular and private networks such as business band radio our products are augmented by our software algorithms this includes embedded firmware that enables the positioning solution and applications software that allows the customer to make use of the positioning information 

we design and market our own products our manufacturing strategy includes a combination of in house assembly as well as the use of third party subcontractors our global operations include major development manufacturing or logistics operations in the united states sweden germany new zealand france canada and the netherlands products are sold through dealers representatives joint ventures and other channels throughout the world these channels are supported by our sales offices located in more than 15 countries 

we began operations in 1978 and incorporated in california in 1981 our common stock has been publicly traded on nasdaq since 1990 under the symbol trmb 

technology overview 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from applying global navigation satellite systems gnss to terrestrial applications gnss systems include a system of 24 orbiting us based satellites and associated ground control that is funded and maintained by the u s government and is available worldwide free of charge a russian satellite based system and the future european galileo system gnss positioning is based on a technique that precisely measures distances from four or more satellites the satellites continuously transmit precisely timed radio signals using extremely accurate atomic clocks a gnss receiver measures distances from the satellites in view by determining the travel time of a signal from the satellite to the receiver and then uses those distances to compute its position under normal circumstances a standalone gnss receiver is able to calculate its position at any point on earth in the earths atmosphere or in lower earth orbit to approximately 10 meters 24 hours a day much better accuracies are possible through a technique called “differential gnss” in addition to providing position gnss provides extremely accurate time measurement 

gnss accuracy is dependent upon the locations of the receiver and the number of gnss satellites that are above the horizon at any given time reception of gnss signals requires lineofsight visibility between the satellites and the receiver which can be blocked by buildings hills and dense foliage the receiver must have a line of sight to at least four satellites to determine its latitude longitude attitude angular orientation and time the accuracy of gnss may also be limited by distortion of gnss signals from ionospheric and other atmospheric conditions 

our gnss products are based on proprietary receiver technology over time the advances in positioning wireless communication and information technologies have enabled us to add more capability to our products and thereby deliver more value to our users for example the developments in wireless technology and deployments of next generation wireless networks have enabled less expensive wireless communications these developments allow for the efficient transfer of position data to locations away from the positioning field device allowing the data to be accessed by more users and thereby increasing productivity this has allowed us to include a wireless link in many of our products and connect remote field operations to a central location 

page 5 

our laser and optical products either measure distances and angles to provide a position in three dimensional space or they provide highly accurate laser references from which position can be established the key element of these products is typically a laser which is generally a commercially available laser diode and a complex mechanical assembly these elements are augmented by software algorithms

page 12 

 

sales and marketing 

we tailor the distribution channel to the needs of our products and regional markets through a number of forms of sales channel solutions around the world we sell our products worldwide primarily through dealers distributors and authorized representatives occasionally granting exclusive rights to market certain products within specific countries this channel is supported and supplemented where third party distribution is not available by our regional sales offices throughout the world we also utilize distribution alliances oem relationships and joint ventures with other companies as a means to serve selected markets 

during the 2005 fiscal year united states represented 54 europe represented 25 asia pacific represented 11 and other regions represented 10 of our total revenues during the 2004 fiscal year united states represented 50 europe represented 28 asia pacific represented 13 and other regions represented 9 of our total revenues 

warranty 

the warranty periods for our products are generally between one and three years selected military programs may require extended warranty periods up to 55 years and certain nikon products have a fiveyear warranty period we support our gps products through a circuit board replacement program from locations in the united kingdom germany japan and the united states the repair and calibration of our nongps products are available from companyowned or authorized facilities we reimburse dealers and distributors for all authorized warranty repairs they perform 

while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from the estimates revisions to the estimated warranty accrual and related costs may be required 

seasonality of business 

 our individual segment revenues may be affected by seasonal buying patterns typically the second fiscal quarter has been the strongest quarter for the company driven by the construction buying season the second quarter has averaged 27 of total revenue in the last two fiscal years 

backlog 

in most of our markets the time between order placement and shipment is short therefore we believe that backlog is not a reliable indicator of present or future business conditions 

manufacturing 

manufacturing of substantially all our gps subsystems is subcontracted to solectron corporation during fiscal 2005 we continued to utilize solectrons suzhou facilities in china for all of our component technologies products during 2004 we expanded our use of solectron in mexico for our field solutions products and handhelds we continue to utilize solectron california for our highend gps products and new product introduction services solectron is responsible for substantially all material procurement assembly and testing we continue to manage product design through pilot production for the subcontracted products and we are directly involved in qualifying suppliers and key components used in all our products our current contract with solectron continues in effect until either party gives the other ninety days written notice

 item 1a   risk factors 

risks and uncertainties 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k and in any other documents to which we refer you in this form 10k before purchasing our securities the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 

our inability to accurately predict orders and shipments may affect our revenue expenses and earnings per share  

we have not been able in the past to consistently predict when our customers will place orders and request shipments so that we cannot always accurately plan our manufacturing requirements as a result if orders and shipments differ from what we predict we may incur additional expenses and build excess inventory which may require additional reserves and allowances any significant change in our customers’ purchasing patterns could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and reported earnings per share for a particular quarter 

our operating results in each quarter may be affected by special conditions such as seasonality late quarter purchases weather and other potential issues 

due in part to the buying patterns of our customers a significant portion of our quarterly revenues occurs from orders received and immediately shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of each quarter although our operating expenses tend to remain fairly predictable engineering and construction purchases tend to occur in early spring and governmental agencies tend to utilize funds available at the end of the government’s fiscal year for additional purchases at the end of our third fiscal quarter in september of each year concentrations of orders sometimes also occur at the end of our other two fiscal quarters additionally a majority of our sales force earns commissions on a quarterly basis which may cause concentrations of orders at the end of any fiscal quarter if for any reason expected sales are deferred orders are not received or shipments are delayed a few days at the end of a quarter our operating results and reported earnings per share for that quarter could be significantly impacted 

we are dependent on a specific manufacturer and assembler for many of our products and on specific suppliers of critical parts for our products 

we are substantially dependent upon solectron corporation in california china and mexico as our preferred manufacturing partner for many of our gps products previously manufactured out of our sunnyvale facilities under the agreement with solectron we provide to solectron a twelvemonth product forecast and place purchase orders with solectron at least thirty calendar days in advance of the scheduled delivery of products to our customers depending on production lead time although purchase orders placed with solectron are cancelable the terms of the agreement would require us to purchase from solectron all inventory not returnable or usable by other solectron customers accordingly if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products we may be unable to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity from solectron to meet customers’ delivery requirements or we may accumulate excess inventories if such inventories are not usable by other solectron customers 

our current contract with solectron continues in effect until either party gives the other ninety days written notice 

in addition we rely on specific suppliers for a number of our critical components we have experienced shortages of components in the past our current reliance on specific or a limited group of suppliers involves several risks including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components and reduced control over pricing any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture such components internally could significantly delay our ability to ship our products which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our reputation and brand and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate 

our operating results have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control results in any period could be affected by 

page 17 

 

 

in addition demand for our products in any quarter or year may vary due to the seasonal buying patterns of our customers in the agricultural and engineering and construction industries due to the foregoing factors our operating results in one or more future periods are expected to be subject to significant fluctuations the price of our common stock could decline substantially in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors which are based primarily on historical models that are not necessarily accurate representations of the future 

our gross margin is subject to fluctuation 

our gross margin is affected by a number of factors including product mix product pricing cost of components foreign currency exchange rates and manufacturing costs for example sales of nikonbranded products generally have lower gross margins as compared to our gps survey products absent other factors a shift in sales towards nikonbranded products would lead to a reduction in our overall gross margins a decline in gross margin could potentially negatively impact our earnings per share 

failure to maintain effective internal controls in compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act could have an adverse effect on our business and stock price 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act requires us to include an internal control report of management in our annual report on form 10k for fiscal 2004 and 2005 we satisfied the requirements of section 404 which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors addressing these assessments 

a system of controls however well designed and operated cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the system will be met in addition the design of a control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events because of the inherent limitations of control systems there is only reasonable assurance that our controls will succeed in achieving their stated goals under all potential future conditions 

we are dependent on new products 

our future revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to bring new products to market on a timely basis we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance of such products we may incur problems in the future in innovating and introducing new products our development stage products may not be successfully completed or if developed may not achieve significant customer acceptance if we were unable to successfully define develop and introduce competitive new products and enhance existing products our future results of operations would be adversely affected development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and we might not achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success a delay in new product introductions could have a significant impact on our results of operations 

page 18 

 

we are dependent on proprietary technology 

our future success and competitive position is dependent upon our proprietary technology and we rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright law to protect our intellectual property the patents owned or licensed by us may be invalidated circumvented and challenged the rights granted under these patents may not provide competitive advantages to us any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us if at all 

others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology duplicate our technology or design around the patents owned by us in addition effective copyright patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in certain countries the steps taken by us to protect our technology might not prevent the misappropriation of such technology 

the value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many current patent filings we recognize that as new patents are issued or are brought to our attention by the holders of such patents it may be necessary for us to withdraw products from the market take a license from such patent holders or redesign our products we do not believe any of our products currently infringe patents or other proprietary rights of third parties but we cannot be certain they do not do so in addition the legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant expense of operations such events could have a material adverse effect on our revenues or profitability 

our products may contain errors or defects which could result in damage to our reputation lost revenues diverted development resources and increased service costs warranty claims and litigation 

 

our devices are complex and must meet stringent requirements we warrant that our products will be free of defect for various periods of time depending on the product in addition certain of our contracts include epidemic failure clauses if invoked these clauses may entitle the customer to return or obtain credits for products and inventory or to cancel outstanding purchase orders even if the products themselves are not defective 

we must develop our products quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing market and we have a history of frequently introducing new products products and services as sophisticated as ours could contain undetected errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new models or versions are released in general our products may not be free from errors or defects after commercial shipments have begun which could result in damage to our reputation lost revenues diverted development resources increased customer service and support costs and warranty claims and litigation which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are dependent on the availability of allocated bands within the radio frequency spectrum 

our gps technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service “sps” provided by the us government’s gps the gps sps operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union “itu” a specialized technical agency of the united nations these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference 

any itu reallocation of radio frequency bands including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products many of our products use other radio frequency bands together with the gps signal to provide enhanced gps capabilities such as realtime kinematic precision the continuing availability of these nongps radio frequencies is essential to provide enhanced gps products to our precision survey and construction machine controls markets any regulatory changes in spectrum allocation or in allowable operating conditions may cause a material adverse effect on our operating results 

in addition unwanted emissions from mobile satellite services and other equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or inband from licensed and unlicensed devices may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products the fcc continually receives proposals for novel technologies and services such as ultrawideband technologies which may seek to operate in or across the radio frequency bands currently used by the gps sps and other public safety services adverse decisions by the fcc that result in harmful interference to the delivery of the gps sps and other radio frequency spectrum also used in our products may result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

page 19 

 

many of our products rely on the gps satellite system 

the gps satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage the satellites currently in orbit were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of 29 satellites in place some have already been in operation for 12 years to repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites a reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities 

in 2004 a presidential policy affirmed a 1996 presidential decision directive that marked the first time in the evolution of gps that access for civilian use free of direct user fees in addition presidential policy has been complemented by corresponding legislation that was signed into law however there can be no assurance that the us government will remain committed to the operation and maintenance of gps satellites over a long period or that the policies of the us government for the use of gps without charge will remain unchanged because of everincreasing commercial applications of gps other us government agencies may become involved in the administration or the regulation of the use of gps signals any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select gpsbased systems instead of products based on competing technologies 

many of our products also use signals from systems that augment gps such as the wide area augmentation system waas and national differential gps system ndgps many of these augmentation systems are operated by the federal government and rely on continued funding and maintenance of these systems in addition some of our products also use satellite signals from the russian glonass system any curtailment of the operating capability of these systems could result in decreased user capability thereby impacting our markets 

the european governments have begun development of an independent satellite navigation system known as galileo we believe we will have access to the signal design to develop compatible receivers however if access to the signal structure is delayed it may have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 

we may be materially affected by new regulatory requirements 

 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations including the handling and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous wastes and emissions and discharges into the environment failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action penalties or the imposition of other liabilities 

in particular under certain of these laws and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of remediating hazardous substances or petroleum products on or from its property without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination as well as incur liability to third parties impacted by such contamination in addition we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and upcoming requirements relating to the materials composition of many of our products the european union “eu” has adopted new directives to facilitate the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment sold in the eu one of these is the restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment “rohs” directive the rohs directive restricts the use of lead mercury and certain other substances in electrical and electronic products placed on the market in the european union after september 30 2006 

similar laws and regulations have been or may be enacted in other regions including in the united states china and japan other environmental regulations may require us to reengineer our products to utilize components which are more environmentally compatible and such reengineering and component substitution may result in additional costs to us although we do not anticipate any material adverse effects based on the nature of our operations and the effect of such laws there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war or terrorism 

acts of war or acts of terrorism could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat or 

page 20 

any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruption to our economy and create further uncertainties to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the us and as such we face exposure to movements in nonus currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows fluctuation in currency impacts our operating results 

currently we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our net income 

we face risks in investing in and integrating new acquisitions 

we have recently acquired several companies and may in the future acquire other companies acquisitions of companies divisions of companies or products entail numerous risks including 

 

 

 

as a result of such acquisitions we have significant assets that include goodwill and other purchased intangibles the testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines for impairment requires significant use of judgment and assumptions changes in business conditions could require adjustments to the valuation of these assets in addition losses incurred by a company in which we have an investment may have a direct impact on our financial statements or could result in our having to writedown the value of such investment any such problems in integration or adjustments to the value of the assets acquired could harm our growth strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and compliance with debt covenants 

we may not be able to enter into or maintain important alliances 

we believe that in certain business opportunities our success will depend on our ability to form and maintain alliances with industry participants such as caterpillar nikon and cnh global our failure to form and maintain such alliances or the preemption of such alliances by actions of other competitors or us will adversely affect our ability to penetrate emerging markets no assurances can be given that we will not experience problems from current or future alliances or that we will realize value from any such strategic alliances 

page 21 

we face competition in our markets 

our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price quality and performance of our products the level of customer service the development of new technology and our ability to participate in emerging markets within each of our markets we encounter direct competition from other gps optical and laser suppliers and competition may intensify from various larger us and nonus competitors and new market entrants some of which may be our current customers the competition in the future may in some cases result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the future against existing and additional competitors will depend largely on our ability to execute our strategy to provide systems and products with significantly differentiated features compared to currently available products we may not be able to implement this strategy successfully and our products may not be competitive with other technologies or products that may be developed by our competitors many of whom have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing sales and other resources than we do 

we must carefully manage our future growth 

growth in our sales or continued expansion in the scope of our operations could strain our current management financial manufacturing and other resources and may require us to implement and improve a variety of operating financial and other systems procedures and controls we have recently implemented a new enterprise resource planning software system and we may experience in our financial and order management processing as a result of new procedures problems associated with any improvement or expansion of these systems procedures or controls may adversely affect our operations and these systems procedures or controls may not be designed implemented or improved in a costeffective and timely manner any failure to implement improve and expand such systems procedures and controls in a timely and efficient manner could harm our growth strategy and adversely affect our financial condition and ability to achieve our business objectives 

we are dependent on retaining and attracting highly skilled development and managerial personnel 

our ability to maintain our competitive technological position will depend in a large part on our ability to attract motivate and retain highly qualified development and managerial personnel competition for qualified employees in our industry and locations is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract motivate and retain enough qualified employees necessary for the future continued development of our business and products 

we are subject to the impact of governmental and other similar certifications 

we market certain products that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold for example ce certification for radiated emissions is required for most gps receiver and data communications products sold in the european union an inability to obtain such certifications in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our operating results also some of our products that use integrated radio communication technology require an end user to obtain licensing from the federal communications commission fcc for frequencyband usage these are secondary licenses that are subject to certain restrictions an inability or delay in obtaining such certifications or changes to the rules by the fcc could adversely affect our ability to bring our products to market which could harm our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to the adverse impact of radio frequency congestion 

we have certain products such as gps rtk systems and surveying and mapping systems that use integrated radio communication technology requiring access to available radio frequencies allocated by the fcc or the ntia in the case of federal government users of this equipment for which the end user is required to obtain a license in order to operate their equipment in addition access to these frequencies by state agencies is under management by state radio communications coordinators some bands are experiencing congestion that excludes their availability for access by state agencies in some states to reduce congestion the fcc announced that it will require migration of radio technology from wideband to narrowband operations in these bands the rules require migration of users to narrowband channels by 2011 in the meantime congestion could cause fcc coordinators to restrict or refuse licenses an inability to obtain access to these radio frequencies by end users could have an adverse effect on our operating results

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect your investment in our common stock 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile during fiscal 2005 our stock price ranged from 4455 to 2664 we believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate perhaps substantially including 

 

 

 

in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of hightech companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the market price of our common stock may decline 

provisions in our charter documents and under california law could prevent or delay a change of control which could reduce the market price of our common stock 

certain provisions of our articles of incorporation as amended and restated our bylaws as amended and restated and the california general corporation law may be deemed to have an antitakeover effect and could discourage a third party from acquiring or make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without approval of our board of directors these provisions could also limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock certain provisions allow the board of directors to authorize the issuance of preferred stock with rights superior to those of the common stock 

we have adopted a preferred shares rights agreement commonly known as a poison pill the provisions described above our poison pill and provisions of the california general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us

 item 7   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that reflect our plans estimates and beliefs our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and those listed under risks factors 

executive level overview 

trimble’s foundation remains positioning technology we have augmented this technology with wireless communication and application capabilities in order to enable us to participate in a wider number of markets and to play a more central role in those markets our efforts to market these technologies can generally be characterized as falling into the categories of either end user markets or component markets the engineering and construction field solutions and mobile solutions segments can be broadly described as end user markets and the component technologies and portfolio technologies segments can be described as components markets in the end user markets we provide a value added solution to the end user typically this requires a solution that includes a hardware platform and customer support in the components businesses we typically sell to another company that adds significant value and brings the solution to the end user 

the segments constituting the end user solutions activities make up over 80 of our revenue the critical success factors in these businesses center around attaining a significant understanding of the end users’ needs applying that knowledge to create highly innovative products integrating those products into an effective system and establishing a proficient global thirdparty distribution 

the components businesses require different characteristics to be successful the customer is typically an oem system integrator or other third party that integrates our components into a system to satisfy this customer group our focus is on price product functionality and quality with recent product introductions we have begun to add higher functionality into our products in order to provide greater value and potentially capture higher average selling prices for our offerings worldwide applications for the product range from vehicle tracking to remote asset management including by way of example monitoring and tracking of construction materials truck trailers and offroad equipment 

during 2005 we continued to execute our strategy with a series of actions that can be summarized in four categories 

reinforcing our position in existing markets 

generally we believe that our markets provide us with additional substantial potential for substituting our technology for traditional methods in 2005 we continued to develop new products and to strengthen our distribution channels to realize these opportunities the acquisitions of pacific crest and apache provided us with additional hardware competencies and applications knowledge a number of new products like trimble s6 and machine control products strengthened our competitive position and created new value for the user 

extend our position in existing markets through new product categories 

we are utilizing the strength of the trimble brand in our markets to expand our revenues by bringing new products to existing users a 2005 example was the introduction of ag gps steer system 

bring existing technology to new markets 

 we continue to reinforce our position in existing markets and positioned ourselves in newer markets that will serve as important sources of future growth our efforts in china india russia korea and eastern europe all reflected improving financial results with the promise of more in the future 

entered completely new markets 

 in fiscal 2005 we acquired advanced public safety inc aps a software development company that provides mobile and handheld software products used by law enforcement firerescue and other public safety agencies with this acquisition we plan to leverage our rugged mobile computing devices and fleet management systems to provide complete mobile resource solutions for the public safety industry the aps acquisition opens up a new vertical 

page 27 

segment in which we can offer public safety agencies complete mobile computing and resource management solutions in addition we acquired mobiletech solutions inc a provider of field workforce automation solutions and that has a leading market position in the direct store delivery dsd market we expect the mobiletech solutions acquisition to extend our portfolio of fleet management and field workforce applications   

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements we consider the accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting polices these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue in accordance with us gaap the accounting rules related to revenue recognition are complex and are impacted by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices both of which are subject to change 

we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer or is uncertain revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met revenue is reduced by a sales return reserve as described under “allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns” 

contracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement shipping documents and customer acceptance when applicable are used to verify delivery we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis as well as the customer’s payment history 

our shipment terms for us orders and international orders fulfilled from our european distribution center are typically fca free carrier shipping point except certain sales to us government agencies which are shipped fob destination fca shipping point means that we fulfill the obligation to deliver when the goods are handed over cleared for export and into the charge of the carrier named by the buyer at the named place or point if no precise point is indicated by the buyer we may choose within the place or range stipulated where the carrier will take the goods into carrier’s charge 

other international orders are shipped fob destination which means these international orders are not recognized as revenue until the product is delivered and title has transferred to the buyer or fca shipping point fob destination means that we bear all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods up to that point 

revenue to distributors and resellers is recognized upon delivery assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met distributors and resellers do not have a right of return 

revenue from purchased extended warranty and support agreements is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the warrantysupport period 

in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue 0021 “accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” when a sale involves multiple elements the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each element are met 

software revenue is recognized in accordance with statement of position sop no 972 “software revenue recognition” and statement of position sop no 989 “modification of sop 972” our software arrangements generally consist of a perpetual license fee and postcontract customer support pcs we have established vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for our pcs contracts based on the renewal rate the remaining value of the software arrangement is allocated to the license fee using the residual method and revenue is primarily recognized when the software has been delivered and there are no remaining obligations revenue from pcs is recognized ratably over the term of the pcs agreement 

page 28 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns 

our accounts receivable balance net of allowance for doubtful accounts was 1451 million as of december 30 2005 compared with 1239 million as of december 31 2004 the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december 30 2005 was 52 million compared with 90 million as of december 31 2004 we make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable in our calculation of the allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors such as age of the accounts receivable balances credit quality historical experience and current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us a specific allowance for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 

a reserve for sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates experienced in the ordinary course of business the reserve for sales returns as of december 30 2005 and december 31 2004 included 15 million and 22 million respectively for estimated future returns that were recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established our revenue could be adversely affected 

inventory valuation 

our inventories net balance was 1079 million as of december 30 2005 compared with 877 million as of december 31 2004 our inventory allowances as of december 30 2005 were 232 million compared with 262 million as of december 31 2004 our inventory is recorded at the lower of standard cost or market net realizable value we generally use a standard cost accounting system to value inventory and these standards are reviewed a minimum of once a year and multiple times a year in our most active manufacturing plants we perform an in depth excess and obsolete analysis of our inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and current market conditions we adjust the inventory value based on estimated excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us additional inventory writedowns may be required 

income taxes 

 

judgments and estimates occur in the calculation of income tax and deferred tax assets and liabilities 

income taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred tax assets or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 

the valuation allowance decreased by 71 million in fiscal 2005 218 million in fiscal 2004 and 131 million in fiscal 2003 approximately 12 million 80 million and 141 million of the valuation allowance at december 30 2005 december 31 2004 and january 2 2004 respectively relate to the tax benefit of stock option deduction which will be credited to equity if and when realized in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance we consider future taxable income resolution of tax uncertainties and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 

goodwill impairment 

goodwill as of december 30 2005 was 2861 million compared with 2595 million as of december 31 2004 we performed goodwill impairment tests at the end of the fiscal third quarter of 2005 and 2004 for each reporting unit and found there was no impairment of our goodwill we will continue to evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at the end of each fiscal third quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 

 

the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant assumptions for goodwill the annual impairment evaluation includes a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit 

page 29 

including goodwill to that reporting unit’s fair value if the reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeds the reporting unit’s carrying value no impairment of goodwill exists if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the unit’s carrying value then an additional analysis is performed to allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if that unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the unit was the purchase price if the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities is less than the carrying value of the unit’s goodwill an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 

we cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill such events include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on our customer base or a material negative change in our relationships with significant customers 

accounting for longlived assets including intangibles subject to amortization 

depreciation and amortization of our longlived assets is provided using straightline methods over their estimated useful lives changes in circumstances such as the passage of new laws or changes in regulations technological advances changes to our business model or changes in the capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from initial estimates in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a longlived asset should be revised we will depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value over its revised remaining useful life factors such as changes in the planned use of equipment customer attrition contractual amendments or mandated regulatory requirements could result in shortened useful lives 

 

longlived assets and asset groups are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable the estimated future cash flows are based upon among other things assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows longlived assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value in the period in which the determination is made 

warranty costs 

the liability for product warranties was 75 million as of december 30 2005 compared with 64 million as of december 31 2004 see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our warranty liability the warranty periods for our products are generally between one and three years selected military programs may require extended warranty periods up to 55 years and certain nikon products have a five year warranty period  we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs technical support labor costs and costs incurred by third parties performing warranty work on our behalf our expected future cost is primarily estimated based upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment 

while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates revisions to the estimated warranty accrual and related costs may be required 

guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 

in the normal course of business to facilitate sales of its products we indemnify other parties including customers lessors and parties to other transactions with us with respect to certain matters we have agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties these agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents 

it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by the company under these agreements were not material and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 30 2005 and december 31 2004 

page 30 

 

stock compensation 

we apply accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 25 and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans and stock purchase plan accordingly we do not recognize compensation cost for stock options granted at a price equal to fair market value 

in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 123 “sfas 123” accounting for stockbased compensation and “statement of financial accounting standards no 148” “sfas 148” “accounting for stockbased compensation  transition and disclosure” we estimated the fair value of the options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan and determined the expense net of related tax effects that would have been included in the determination of net income if the fair value based method had been applied to all awards stockbased compensation net of tax was 87 million 86 million and 98 million for fiscal 2005 fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 

for options granted prior to october 1 2005 the fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model for stock options granted on or after october 1 2005 the fair value of each award is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial valuation model similar to the blackscholes model the binomial model takes into account variables such as volatility dividend yield rate and risk free interest rate in addition   the binomial model incorporates actual optionpricing behavior and changes in volatility over the option’s contractual term for these reasons we believe that the binomial model provides a fair value that is more representative of actual experience and future expected experience than the value calculated using the blackscholes model below is a comparison of assumptions used in under each valuation model in fiscal 2005 

 

note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements describes the plans we operate and note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the pro forma effects to reported net income and earnings per share for fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 as if we had elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value of the options granted at grant date 

investment in joint ventures 

we have adopted the equity method of accounting for our investments in the caterpillar and nikon joint ventures this requires that we record our share of the joint ventures’ profits or losses in a given fiscal period see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for joint venture accounting

results of operations 

overview 

the following table is a summary of revenue gross margin and operating income for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

 

basis of presentation 

we have a 5253 week fiscal year ending on the friday nearest to december 31 which for fiscal 2005 was december 30 2005 fiscal 2005 was a 53week year and fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 were 52week years as a result of the extra week in fiscal 2005 yearoveryear results are not exactly comparable thus due to the inherent nature of adopting a 5253 week fiscal year the company analysts shareholders investors and others will have to make appropriate adjustments to any analysis performed when comparing our activities and results in fiscal years that contain 53 weeks to those that contain the standard 52 weeks

revenue   

in fiscal 2005 total revenue increased by 1061 million or 159 to 7749 million from 6688 million in fiscal 2004 the increase in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to stronger performances across all our operating segments with the exception of component technologies the engineering and construction field solutions and mobile solutions segments increased 19 21 and 34 respectively compared to fiscal 2004 revenue growth within these segments was driven by new product introductions and increased penetration of existing markets both the engineering and construction and mobile solutions operating segments also benefited from the impact of the pacific crest apache and mobiletech acquisitions 

in fiscal 2004 total revenue increased by 1279 million or 236 to 6688 million from 5409 million in fiscal 2003 this increase was primarily due to stronger performances in most of our operating segments driven by new product offerings and increased penetration of the markets we serve primarily engineering and construction and field solutions expanded distribution and selective acquisitions primarily mobile solutions and portfolio technologies as well as the positive impact of the weaker us dollar on revenues generated in foreign currencies primarily the euro 

 during the 2005 fiscal year sales to customers in the united states represented 54 europe represented 25 asia pacific represented 11 and other regions represented 10 of our total revenues during the 2004 fiscal year sales to customers in the united states represented 50 europe represented 28 asia pacific represented 13 and other regions represented 9 of our total revenues we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to account for a major portion of our revenues 

 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 it is possible however that in future periods the failure of one or more large customers to purchase products in quantities anticipated by us may adversely affect the results of operations 

gross margin 

our gross margin varies due to a number of factors including product mix pricing distribution channel used the effects of production volumes new product startup costs and foreign currency translations gross margin as a percentage of total revenues was 503 in fiscal 2005 and 486 in fiscal 2004 the increase in gross margin percentage for fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 was due to the success of our market segmentation strategy higher service revenues cost reductions and introduction of higher margin products 

gross margin as a percentage of total revenues was 486  in fiscal 2004 and 496 in fiscal 2003 the decrease in gross margin percentage for fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 was due to changes in the mix of products sold principally related to increased sales of lower margin nikonbranded survey and construction products our agriculture products pricing pressure in our component technologies business which typically demonstrates increased unit volumes coupled with declining unit prices the impact of the weaker us dollar on our non us manufacturing and distribution costs 

 because of potential product mix changes within and among the industry markets market pressures on unit selling prices fluctuations in unit manufacturing costs including increases in component prices and other factors current level gross margins cannot be assured 

operating income 

operating income as a percentage of total revenue was 161 in fiscal 2005 compared to 128 in fiscal 2004 and 100 in fiscal 2003 the increase is driven by improvement in revenues in gross margins and greater leverage of operating expenses operating expenses represented 342 of total revenue in fiscal 2005 as compared to 358 in fiscal 2004 

results by segment 

to achieve distribution marketing production and technology advantages in our targeted markets we manage our operations in the following five segments engineering and construction field solutions component technologies mobile solutions and portfolio technologies segment operating income loss is net revenue less operating expenses excluding general corporate expenses amortization of purchased intangibles restructuring charges nonoperating income expense and income taxes 

page 33 

 

the following table is a breakdown of revenue and operating income by segment for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 

 

 

a reconciliation of our consolidated segment operating income to consolidated income before income taxes follows 

 

engineering and construction   

engineering and construction revenues increased by 840 million or 19 while segment operating income increased by 385 million or 484 for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 the revenue growth was driven by the introduction of products such as the trimble s6 and machine control products and growth of existing products such as the trimble r8 gps system revenue growth was also attributed to the acquisitions for fiscal 2005 segment operating income increased as a result of higher revenues and increased sales of higher margin products 

page 34 

 

engineering and construction revenues increased by 734 million or 20 while segment operating income increased by 188 million or 311 for fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 the relatively strong environment of fiscal 2003 continued into fiscal 2004 resulting in continued robust demand for survey machine control and laser products in addition the full year effects for nikonbranded products contributed to the year over year increase targeted new product introductions such as the 5500 servo driven total station provided improved market penetration the weaker us dollar also contributed to increased revenues in this operating segment operating income increased at a higher rate than revenue growth due to greater operating leverage on expenses 

field solutions 

field solutions revenues increased by approximately 223 million or 211 while segment operating income increased by 74 million or 293 for fiscal year 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 revenue increased primarily due to successful new products such as the ag gps ezguide system and ag gps ezsteer system in our agriculture product line and as a result of higher demand for both automated and manual guidance products into the agricultural market in the first quarter of the fiscal year 

field solutions revenues increased by approximately 257 million or 322 while segment operating income increased by 107 million or 735 for fiscal year 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 revenues increased primarily as a result of higher demand for both automated and manual guidance products in the agricultural market in particular revenues were enhanced by the introduction of ezguide plus we saw increases in our gis product lines due to increases in our dealer and distributor business additionally programs designed to expand our distribution channel by supplementing valueadded solutions focused business partners to our traditional dealer profile were successful in addition we saw improved results in europe and increased opportunities in china increases in this segment’s operating income were primarily due to higher revenues

component technologies revenues decreased by 116 million or 177 and segment operating income decreased by 58 million or 421 for the fiscal year 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 revenues decreased primarily due to the decline in demand for our invehicle navigation products as a result of changes in buying strategies among certain automotive manufacturers and softness in the timing businesses the decrease was partially offset by an increase in the oem board business operating income decreased primarily due to lower revenue and unfavorable product mix 

component technologies revenues increased by 13 million or 21 while segment operating income decreased by 27 million or 162 for the fiscal year 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 revenues increased primarily due to higher demand from vehicle navigation and tracking customers partially offset by the decline in demand from wireless infrastructure customers the segment operating income decrease was primarily due to pricing pressures from the embedded and invehicle navigation product lines a less favorable product mix and increased spending for development of new categories of products 

mobile solutions 

mobile solutions revenues increased by 80 million or 338 in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 due to increased subscriber growth an increase in sales into the readymix suppliers and increased sales from our dealer channel as we continue to develop and extend this channel operating loss decreased in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 primarily attributable to an increase in revenues and increase in gross margins due higher recurring service revenue 

mobile solutions revenues increased by 106 million or 813 in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 due primarily to increases sales into the construction materials market higher dealer sales and a significant enterprise sale during the first quarter of fiscal 2004 we completed the acquisition of tracernet to strengthen our presence in this segment the benefits of the integration were not fully reflected until the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and the full year impact of these activities were not realized until fiscal 2005 segment operating loss decreased by 05 million or 71 in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 due to increased revenues which was largely offset by increased expenses related to the integration of the tracernet acquisition

portfolio technologies   

portfolio technologies revenues increased by 35 million or 105 while segment operating income increased by 03 million or 64 for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 the increase in revenue and operating income was primarily due to stronger performance in our applanix airborne business which was offset by an increase in marketing expenses related to our trimble outdoors initiative 

portfolio technologies revenues increased by 169 million or 1006 while segment operating income increased by 66 million or 3886 for fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 the increases in revenues and operating income were primarily due to the inclusion of full year results of applanix acquired in july 2003 and higher sales of our military and advanced systems products 

research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 

the following table shows research and development “rd” sales and marketing and general and administrative “ga” expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues for the fiscal years ended 2005 2004 and 2003 and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions of those operating expenses below 

 

overall rd sales and marketing and ga increased by approximately 263 million in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 

research and development expenses increased by 67 million in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to the inclusion of expenses from acquisitions not applicable in the prior year in the amount of 28 million and increase in compensation of 28 million all of our rd costs have been expensed as incurred cost of software developed for external sale subsequent to reaching technical feasibility were not considered material and were expensed as incurred 

research and development expenses increased by 99 million in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to sustaining engineering expenses and costs incurred related to new product development continued investment in next generation technologies and the effect of foreign currency fluctuations 

 overall research and development spending remained relatively constant at approximately 11 of revenues we expect to continue to devote resources to the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products we believe that research and development is critical to our strategic product development objectives and that to leverage our leading technology and meet the changing requirements of our customers we will need to fund investments in several development projects in parallel 

sales and marketing expenses increased by 122 million in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 but decreased as a percent of total revenues the increase was primarily due to advertising and promotion costs associated with the launch of new products of 54 million the inclusion of expenses from acquisitions not applicable in the prior year of 15 million increase in travel expenses of 14 million increase in compensation of 17 million and an increase 06 million foreign currency transaction loss 

sales and marketing expenses increased by 102 million in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 but decreased as a percent of total revenues the majority of the increase was due to the increase in revenue promotional programs associated with new products and the foreign exchange impact on expenses in our non us operations   

 we intend to continue to focus and expand our sales and marketing efforts across all the geographies and markets we serve in order to increase market awareness of our products and to better support our existing customers worldwide our future growth will depend in part on the timely development and continued viability of the markets in which we currently compete as well as our ability to continue to identify and exploit new markets for our products 

page 36 

 

general and administrative expenses increased by 74 million in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to an increase in compensation expense of 59 million increase in rent expense of 10 million as we were making duplicate payments during our move to our new headquarters the inclusion of expenses from acquisitions not applicable in the prior year of 18 million and increase of 08 million in patent expense this was partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of 17 million and an increase of 04 million foreign currency transaction gain spending overall remained relatively constant at approximately 7 of revenues 

general and administrative expenses increased by 54 million in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to the inclusion of ga expenses from acquisitions expenses related to compliance with the sarbanesoxley act and bad debt expenses of 12 million 

other operating expenses 

restructuring charges 

restructuring charges of 03 million 06 million and 20 million were recorded in fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the charges in fiscal 2005 were primarily related to office closure costs due to integration efforts of the mensi acquisition the charges in fiscal 2004 were primarily related to severance costs due to the realignment of trimble mobile solutions inc while charges in fiscal 2003 were primarily related to our japanese office relocation due to the nikontrimble joint venture formation as a result of these actions the headcount of the affected operations decreased by 36 and 77 in fiscal 2004 and 2003 respectively as of december 30 2005 the remaining accrual balance of 03 million is related to the office closure expected to be paid over the next several years 

inprocess research and development 

 

we recorded inprocess research and development iprd expense of 11 million related to acquisitions made in fiscal 2005 we did not record any iprd expense in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 at the date of each acquisition the projects associated with the iprd efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no alternative future uses the value of the iprd was determined using a discounted cash flow model similar to the income approach focusing on the income producing capabilities of the inprocess technologies accordingly the value assigned to these iprd amounts were charged to expense on the respective acquisition date of each of the acquired companies 

 

amortization of purchased and other intangible assets 

 

amortization expense of purchased and other intangibles represented 09 of revenue in fiscal 2005 a decrease of 15 million from fiscal 2004 when it represented 13 of revenue although we had acquisitions in the current fiscal year amortization decreased due to the fact our spectra precision group intangibles were fully amortized in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 amortization expense of purchased and other intangibles represented 13 of revenue in fiscal 2004 an increase of 06 million from fiscal 2003 when it represented 15 of revenue

nonoperating expense net 

the following table shows nonoperating expense net for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions of those expenses below 

 

nonoperating expense net decreased by 105 million or 985 during fiscal 2005 as compared with fiscal 2004 primarily due to a decrease in net interest expense of 20 million as a result of the repayment of debt and interest earned on higher cash balances offset by a 09 million writeoff of debt issuance costs relating to the 2003 credit facility an increase of 19 million in foreign currency transaction gain and a 73 million decrease in expenses for affiliated operations as a result of increased profits from our joint ventures and recognition of the remaining deferred gain from the caterpillar joint venture this was partially offset by a decrease in other income primarily due to the absence of a nonrecurring gain in investments of approximately 10 million in fiscal year 2004 

 expenses for affiliated operation decreased by 73 million in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 due to the recognition of the remaining 92 million deferred gain related to the caterpillar joint venture since the joint venture is now profitable on a sustainable basis future operating losses are not anticipated and there are no future outstanding financial obligations by us to the joint venture we recognized the gain this amount was offset by an increased impact from the incremental transfer pricing effects due to growth in our construction product sales of 26 million see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for financial information regarding joint ventures furthermore we recorded our share of profits in the caterpillar joint venture which increased by 25 million this was partially offset by a decrease in our share of profits in our nikontrimble joint venture of 11 million 

nonoperating expense net decreased by 76 million or 42 during fiscal 2004 as compared with fiscal 2003 primarily due to lower interest expense after the repayment of the principal balance of a subordinated note in june 2003 the write off of 23 million of debt issuance costs as a result of our debt refinancing in june 2003 and 13 million related to the write off of the remaining unamortized portion of the warrants issued to spectraphysics holdings usa inc the increases in expense for affiliated operations were primarily due to our higher construction machine control revenues which led to increased impact from the pricing effects of transactions between us and the caterpillar joint venture this was partially offset by an increase of 11 million related to our share of profits in the nikontrimble joint venture the increase in other income expense was primarily due to a net gain related to the sale of an investment 

income tax provision 

our effective income tax rates for fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 were 32 10 and 8 respectively the 2004 and 2003 income tax rates are less than the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the realization of benefits from net operating losses and other previously reserved deferred tax assets our 2005 income tax rate is less than us federal statutory rate primarily due to the benefit from the us incentive repatriation of undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings provided by the american jobs creation act of 2004   

repatriation of foreign earnings the american jobs creation act of 2004 the act provides for a special onetime elective dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer equal to 85 of the eligible distribution during the fourth quarter of 2005 the company repatriated 395 million of which 24 million qualified for the special onetime elective dividends received deduction and 155 million constituted earnings that do not qualify under the act previously taxed income and return of capital the company recorded a 64 million tax benefit from these foreign earnings

litigation matters 

 from time to time we are involved in litigation arising out of the ordinary course of our business there are no known claims or pending litigation that are expected to have a material effect on our overall financial position results of operations or liquidity 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

other than lease commitments incurred in the normal course of business see contractual obligation table below we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities guarantee contracts retained or contingent interests in transferred assets or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity we do not have any majorityowned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements additionally we do not have any interest in or relationship with any special purpose entities 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

cash and cash equivalents 

our financial condition further strengthened at december 30 2005 cash and cash equivalents totaled 739 million with essentially no debt compared to cash and cash equivalents of 719 million and debt of 390 million at december 31 2004 

in fiscal 2005 cash provided by operating activities was 929 million as compared to 746 million in fiscal 2004 the increase of 183 million was primarily driven by the 172 million increase in net income during fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 our ability to continue to generate cash from operations will depend in large part on profitability the rate of collections of accounts receivable our inventory turns and our ability to manage other areas of working capital our accounts receivable days for sales outstanding increased from 63 days at the end of fiscal 2004 to 66 days at the end of fiscal 2005 the increase is due to acquisitions delayed payments from some government contracts and past due accounts from a couple of key customers our inventory turns was unchanged at four at the end of fiscal 2005 and 2004 

in fiscal 2004 cash provided by operating activities was 746 million as compared to 296 million in fiscal 2003 the increase of 450 million was primarily driven by the 292 million increase in net income during fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 and better management of working capital our accounts receivable days for sales outstanding decreased from 65 days at the end of fiscal 2003 to 63 days at the end of fiscal 2004 our inventory turns was unchanged at four at the end of fiscal 2005 and 2004 

cash used in investing activities was 749 million in fiscal 2005 as compared to 251 million in fiscal 2004 the 498 million increase was primarily due to an increase of 400 million in cash acquisitions and an increase of 106 million in investment in capital equipment of which 66 million was related to the relocation of our sunnyvale headquarters 

cash used in investing activities was 251 million in fiscal 2004 as compared to 227 million in fiscal 2003 the increase was primarily due to cash acquisitions and investment in capital equipment during fiscal 2004 we spent approximately 128 million on capital expenditures 

page 39 

cash used in financing activities was 134 million in fiscal 2005 as compared to 242 million in fiscal 2004 the 108 million decrease was primarily due to a 129 million decrease in repayment of net debt as we repaid our entire debt balance in the second fiscal quarter of 2005 this was partially offset by a 23m decrease in proceeds received from issuance of common stock and warrants 

cash used in financing activities was 242 million in fiscal 2004 as compared to 54000 in fiscal 2003 however during fiscal 2004 we repaid approximately 652 million of debt related to our previous 2003 credit facility these debt payments were funded by cash provided by operating activities and the issuance of common stock to employees pursuant to our stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan of approximately 268 million 

 we believe that our cash and cash equivalents together with our credit facilities 200 million as of december 30 2005 will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months 

 we expect fiscal 2006 capital expenditures to be approximately 15 million to 20 million primarily for computer equipment software upgrades manufacturing tools and test equipment and leasehold improvements associated with business expansion   decisions related to how much cash is used for investing are influenced by the expected amount of cash to be provided by operations 

debt 

at the end of fiscal 2005 our total debt was comprised of government loans to foreign subsidiaries in amount of approximately 649000 as compared with approximately 390 million at the end of fiscal 2004 

on july 28 2005 we entered into a 200 million unsecured revolving credit agreement “2005 credit facility” with a syndicate of 10 banks with the bank of nova scotia as the administrative agent the 2005 credit facility replaces our 175 million secured 2003 credit facility the funds available under the new 2005 credit facility may be used for our general corporate purposes and up to 25 million of the 2005 credit facility may be used for letters of credit we incur a commitment fee if the 2005 credit facility is not used the commitment fee is not material to our results during all periods presented at december 30 2005 and as of the date of this report the company has a zero balance outstanding and was in compliance with all financial debt covenants for additional discussion of our debt see note 9 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 30 2005 

 

total debt consists of government loans to foreign subsidiaries see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further financial information regarding longterm debt 

other purchase obligations and commitments represent open noncancelable purchase orders for material purchases with our vendors and a forecasted commitment with a supplier for outsourced services as described in note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements our pension obligation which is not included in the table above and is included in “other noncurrent liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets is disclosed at note 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

new accounting standards 

in may 2005 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard fasb no 154 accounting changes and error corrections sfas 154 which replaces accounting principles board opinions no 20 accounting changes and sfas no 3 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statementsan amendment of apb opinion no 28 sfas 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections it establishes retrospective application or the latest practicable date as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of an error sfas 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 and is required to be adopted by the company in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 the company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas 154 will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition but does not expect it to have a material impact 

in march 2005 the fasb issued fasb interpretation number fin 47 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 143 fin 47 fin 47 requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated fin 47 is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2005 the company was not impacted by the adoption of fin 47 in fiscal 2005 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” sfas no 123r requires employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans to be accounted for under the fair value method and eliminates the ability to account for these instruments under the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb opinion no 25 and allowed under the original provisions of sfas no 123 sfas no 123r requires the use of an option pricing model for estimating fair value which is amortized to expense over the service periods the requirements of sfas no 123r are effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 sfas no 123r allows for either prospective recognition of compensation expense or retrospective recognition which may be back to the original issuance of sfas no 123 or only to interim periods in the year of adoption the company will use the prospective method for future fiscal period after the sfas no 123r effective date of 123105 as a result financial statements for fiscal periods after our sfas no 123r effective date will include stockbased compensation expenses that are not comparable to financial statements of fiscal periods prior to the sfas no 123r effective date due to constant fluctuations to the expected volatility expected term risk free interest rate and expected forfeiture assumptions used in valuating stockbased compensation expected stockbased compensation expense in future fiscal periods is not predictable

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes all financial instruments are used in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors 

market interest rate risk 

we may be exposed to market risk in the event we borrow against our 2005 credit facility borrowings under the 2005 credit facility have interest payments based on a floating rate of libor plus a number of basis points tied to a formula based on our leverage ratio the 2005 credit facility had outstanding principal balances of zero as of december 30 2005 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain trade and intercompany receivables and payables primarily denominated in australian canadian new zealand and swedish currencies the euro and the british pound these contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements as the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses on the forward contracts these instruments are marked to market through earnings every period and generally range from one to three months in original maturity we do not enter into foreign exchange forward contract for trading purposes 

foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of december 30 2005 and december 31 2004 are summarized as follows in thousands 

 

 we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position utilizing our current hedging strategy

item 1   business overview

trimble navigation limited a california corporation trimble or the company
or we or our or us provides advanced positioning product solutions most
typically to commercial and government users the principle  applications served
include  surveying  construction   agriculture  urban  and  natural  resource
management  and fleet and asset  management  our  products  typically  provide
benefits  that can include lower  operational  costs  and higher  productivity
examples of products  include systems that guide  agricultural  and construction
equipment  surveying  instruments  systems that track fleets of vehicles  and
data  collection  systems  that  enable  the  management  of  large  amounts  of
georeferenced  information  in addition we also manufacture components for in
vehicle  navigation  and  telematics  systems  and timing  modules  used in the
synchronization of wireless networks

trimble products often combine  knowledge of location or position  together with
applications  software  and a wireless  link to provide a solution to a specific
application  position is provided through a number of alternative  technologies
including  the global  positioning  system  gps and systems  that use laser or
optical technologies to establish position  wireless  communication  techniques
include both public networks  such as cellular  and private networks  such as
business band radio a significant amount of the differentiation in our products
is provided through  software  this includes embedded firmware that enables the
positioning solution and applications  software that allows the customer to make
use of the positioning information

we design and market our own products  our  manufacturing  strategy  includes a
combination   of  in  house   assembly  as  well  as  the  use  of  third  party
subcontractors  our global operations include major development  manufacturing
or logistics  operations in the united  states  sweden  germany  new zealand
france  canada  and  the  netherlands  products  are  sold  through  dealers
representatives  joint ventures and other channels throughout the world these
channels are supported by our sales offices located in more than 20 countries

we began  operations in 1978 and  incorporated in california in 1981 our common
stock has been publicly traded on nasdaq since 1990 under the symbol trmb

technology overview

a  majority  of  our  revenue  is  derived  from  applying  gps  to  terrestrial
applications  gps is a system of 24 orbiting  satellites and associated  ground
control that is funded and  maintained by the u s  government and is available
worldwide free of charge gps positioning is based on a technique that precisely
measures  distances from four or more  satellites  the satellites  continuously
transmit precisely timed radio signals using extremely accurate atomic clocks a
gps receiver  measures  distances from the satellites in view by determining the
travel time of a signal from the satellite to the receiver  and then uses those
distances to compute its position under normal circumstances a standalone gps
receiver is able to calculate its position at any point on earth in the earths
atmosphere or in lower earth orbit to approximately 10 meters 24 hours a day
much better  accuracies are possible  through a technique  called  differential
gps in addition to providing  position  gps provides  extremely accurate time
measurement

gps accuracy is dependent  upon the  locations of the receiver and the number of
gps  satellites  that are above the horizon at any given time  reception of gps
signals  requires  lineofsight  visibility  between  the  satellites  and  the
receiver  which can be blocked by  buildings  hills  and dense  foliage  the
receiver must have a line of sight to at least four  satellites to determine its
latitude longitude  attitude angular orientation  and time the accuracy of
gps may also be limited by distortion of gps signals from  ionospheric and other
atmospheric conditions

our gps products are based on proprietary  receiver  technology  over time the
advances in positioning  wireless communication  and information  technologies
have enabled us to add more  capability to our products and thereby deliver more
value to our users for example  the recent developments in wireless technology
and deployments of next generation wireless networks have enabled less expensive
wireless communications  these developments allow for the efficient transfer of
position data to locations away from the positioning field device  allowing the
data to be accessed by more users and thereby increasing productivity  this has
allowed us to include a wireless link in many of our products and connect remote
field operations to a central location

page

our laser and optical products either measure  distances and angles to provide a
position  in three  dimensional  space or they  provide  highly  accurate  laser
references  from which  position can be  established  the key elements of these
products  are  typically a laser  which is generally a  commercially  available
laser diode and a complex mechanical  assembly  these elements are augmented by
software algorithms


business strategy


our business strategy is developed around an analysis of several key elements

     o    attractive  markets  we focus on  markets  that offer  potential  for
          revenue growth profitability and market leadership

     o    innovative   solutions  that  provide  significant   benefits  to  our
          customers  we seek to apply our technology to applications  for which
          position data is important  and where we can create  unique value  we
          look for  opportunities in which the rate of  technological  change is
          high and which have a  requirement  for the  integration  of  multiple
          technologies into a solution

     o    distribution   channels  to  best  access  our  markets    we  select
          distribution channels that best serve the needs of individual markets
          these channels can include  independent  dealers  direct sales joint
          ventures  oem sales and distribution alliances with key partners we
          view  international  expansion as an important element of our strategy
          and seek to develop international channels

business segments and markets

we are organized  into four main  operating  segments  encompassing  our various
applications and product lines  engineering and construction  field solutions
component technologies and mobile solutions our portfolio technologies segment
aggregates smaller businesses  primarily focused on defense and the integration
of gps and inertial technologies  our segments are distinguished by the markets
they serve  each  segment  consists of  businesses  which are  responsible  for
product development marketing sales strategy and financial performance

engineering and construction

products in the engineering and  construction  segment improve  productivity and
accuracy  throughout  the entire  construction  process  including  the  initial
survey  planning  design site preparation  and building phases our products
are  intended  to  both  improve  the  productivity  of each  phase  as well as
facilitate the entire process by improving information flow from one step to the

status of a vehicle without driver intervention  our agreement with mcneilus a
major  manufacturer  of trucks for the ready mix concrete  and waste  management
industries  facilitates  factory  installations  of our management  solution to
ready mix concrete fleet operators mcneilus along with a trimble sales force
markets our  solution  as a retrofit  for trucks  already in the field  or as a
factoryinstalled  option  we plan on leveraging our  technology  partners and
customers into other verticals  such as other  construction  material  delivery
vehicles and waste management  trucks  where a customized  solution can provide
similar benefits as in ready mix

we also have a horizontal  market  strategy  that  focuses on providing  turnkey
solutions  to a broad  range of service  fleets and mobile  workers  that span a
large number of market segments here we leverage the same general applications
that are used in our vertical  markets without the same level of  customization
these  products  are  distributed   through   individual   dealers  as  well  as
aftermarket automotive electronics suppliers

sales and marketing

we tailor the  distribution  channel to the needs of our  products  and regional
markets through a number of forms of sales channel  solutions  around the world
we sell our products  worldwide  primarily  through dealers  distributors  and
authorized  representatives  occasionally  granting  exclusive rights to market
certain  products  within  specific  countries  this channel is  supported  and
supplemented  where third party  distribution is not available by our regional
sales offices in north america  europe  australia  china korea new zealand
singapore and united arab emirates we also utilize distribution alliances oem
relationships  and  joint  ventures  with  other  companies  as a means to serve
selected markets

sales  to   unaffiliated   customers   outside  the  united   states   comprised
approximately  50 in 2004 51 in 2003 and 49 in 2002 during the 2004 fiscal
year  north and south  america  represented  57  europe  the middle east and
africa represented 30 and asia represented 13 of our total revenues

support and warranty

the warranty periods for our products are generally between one and three years
selected  military  programs  may require  extended  warranty  periods up to 55
years  certain tds products have a 90day  warranty  period  and certain nikon
products have a fiveyear warranty period we support our gps products through a
circuit board replacement program from locations in the united kingdom germany
japan and the united states the repair and calibration of our nongps products
are available from companyowned or authorized facilities  we reimburse dealers
and distributors for all authorized warranty repairs they perform

while we engage in extensive  product quality programs and processes  including
actively  monitoring  and  evaluating  the quality of component  suppliers  our
warranty  obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage  and
service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product  failure  should actual
product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from the
estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty accrual and related costs may be
required

seasonality of business

 our  revenues  are  affected  by  seasonal  buying  patterns  in  some  of our
businesses  over half of our  total  revenue  comes  from our  engineering  and
construction  business  which  has the  biggest  seasonal  impact  on our total
revenue this business and therefore our total revenue is seasonally strongest
during the second quarter due to the start of the construction  buying season in
the northern  hemisphere  in spring  typically  we expect the first and fourth
quarters  to be the  seasonal  lows due to the lack of  construction  during the
winter months  the second quarter has averaged to 262 of total revenue in the
last two fiscal years versus a straight line of 25 per quarter

backlog

in most of our markets  the time between order placement and shipment is short
therefore  we believe  that  backlog is not a reliable  indicator of present or
future business conditions

item 7 managements  discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
of operations

the following  discussion  should be read in conjunction  with the  consolidated
financial  statements and the related notes the following  discussion  contains
forwardlooking  statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs  our
actual   results   could  differ   materially   from  those   discussed  in  the
forwardlooking  statements  factors  that could cause or  contribute  to these
differences  include  but are not limited to those  discussed  below and those
listed under risks and uncertainties


executive level overview

trimbles  foundation  remains  positioning  technology  we have augmented this
technology  with wireless  communication  and software  capabilities in order to
enable us to participate in a wider number of markets and to play a more central
role in those markets our efforts to market these technologies can generally be
characterized  as falling  into the  categories  of either  end user  markets or
component markets the engineering and construction field solutions and mobile
solutions  segments  can be  broadly  described  as end  user  markets  and  the
component  technologies and portfolio  technologies segments can be described as
components markets in the end user markets we provide a value added solution to
the end user  typically  this  requires  a  solution  that  includes a hardware
platform  significant applications software and substantial levels of customer
support in the components businesses we typically sell to another company that
adds significant value and brings the solution to the end user

the segments constituting the end user solutions  activities  make up over 80
of our revenue  the critical success factors in these businesses  center around
attaining a significant  understanding  of the end users  needs  applying that
knowledge to create highly innovative products  integrating those products into
an  effective  system  and  establishing  a  proficient   global   thirdparty
distribution

the components  businesses  require different  characteristics to be successful
the customer is typically an oem system  integrator  or other third party that
integrates our components  into a system  to satisfy this customer  group  our
focus is on price  product  functionality  and  quality  with recent  product
introductions  we have begun to add higher  functionality  into our  products in
order to provide  greater value and  potentially  capture higher average selling
prices for our offerings  for example  our trimtrac product integrates gps and
gsm  cellular   technologies  into  a  fully  functional   location  device  it
establishes a new asset tracking or security  capability at an aggressive  price
point  and  opens up a new  class  of  customers  and  applications  which  were
previously not available to us

during 2004 we continued  to execute our strategy  with a series of actions that
can be summarized in four categories

reinforcing our position in existing markets

generally  we believe that our markets provide us with additional  substantial
potential for  substituting our technology for traditional  methods  in 2004 we
continued to develop new products and to strengthen our distribution channels to
realize these  opportunities  the acquisitions of geonav and tracernet provided
us with additional software capability and applications  knowledge  a number of
new products such as the easy guide plus strengthened our competitive position
and  created  new value for the user  the first full year of  operation  of our
joint  venture  with nikon  proved  successful  in  extending  our  position  in
surveying instruments

extend our position in existing markets through new product categories

we are  utilizing the strength of the trimble brand in our markets to expand our
revenues by bringing  new  products to existing  users  a 2004  example was the
introduction  of  asset  and  fleet  management  services  to  the  construction
industry

bring existing technology to new markets

we continue to  reinforce  our  position in  existing  markets  and  positioned
ourselves  in newer  markets  that will  serve as  important  sources  of future
growth  our  efforts in china  india  russia  korea and  eastern  europe all
reflected improving financial results with the promise of more in the future

page

pioneer completely new markets

in 2004 we introduced the trimtrac product and trimble  outdoors  both products
embed new feature  sets and are  intended to address  markets not  traditionally
served by trimble

critical accounting policies and estimates

our accounting  policies are more fully  described in note 2 of the notes to the
consolidated  financial statements  the preparation of financial statements and
related disclosures in conformity with accounting  principles generally accepted
in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates
that affect the amounts  reported in the consolidated  financial  statements and
accompanying  notes to the consolidated  financial  statements  we consider the
accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting polices  these
critical   accounting   policies  are  impacted   significantly   by  judgments
assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported
based on these policies

revenue recognition

we recognize product revenue when persuasive  evidence of an arrangement exists
delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is
reasonably  assured  in  instances  where  final  acceptance  of the product is
specified  by the  customer  or is  uncertain  revenue  is  deferred  until all
acceptance  criteria have been met revenue is reduced by a sales return reserve
as described under allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns

revenue from purchased  extended warranty and support agreements is deferred and
recognized ratably over the term of the warrantysupport  period  substantially
all technology  licenses and research  revenue have consisted of initial license
fees and  royalties  which were  recognized  when  earned  provided  we had no
remaining obligations

contracts  and customer  purchase  orders are  generally  used to determine  the
existence of an arrangement  shipping documents and customer  acceptance  when
applicable  are used to verify delivery  we assess whether the fee is fixed or
determinable  based on the payment terms  associated  with the  transaction  and
whether  the  sales  price  is  subject  to  refund  or  adjustment  we  assess
collectibility  based  primarily  on the  creditworthiness  of the  customer  as
determined  by credit  checks and analysis  as well as the  customers  payment
history

our shipment terms for us orders  and  international  orders fulfilled from our
european  distribution  center are typically fca free carrier  shipping point
except   certain  sales  to  us  government   agencies  which  are  shipped  fob
destination  fca shipping point means that we fulfill the obligation to deliver
when the goods are handed over  cleared for export  and into the charge of the
carrier  named by the buyer at the named place or point  if no precise point is
indicated by the buyer we may choose within the place or range stipulated where
the carrier will take the goods into carriers charge

other  international  orders are  shipped  fob  destination  which  means these
international  orders  are not  recognized  as  revenue  until  the  product  is
delivered  and title has  transferred  to the buyer or fca shipping  point  fob
destination  means  that we bear all  costs  and  risks of loss or damage to the
goods up to that point

revenue to distributors and resellers is recognized upon delivery  assuming all
other criteria for revenue recognition have been met distributors and resellers
do not have a right of return

when a sale involves multiple  elements  the entire fee from the arrangement is
allocated  to each  respective  element  based on its  relative  fair  value and
recognized  when  revenue  recognition  criteria  for each  element are met the
amount of product revenue  allocated to an individual  element is limited to the
lesser of its relative  fair value or the amount not  contingent on our delivery
of other elements under the  arrangement  regardless of the  probability of our
performance

our software  arrangements  generally consist of a license fee and postcontract
customer support pcs we have established  vendorspecific  objective evidence
vsoe of fair  value  for our pcs  contracts  based on the  renewal  rate  the
remaining  value of the  software  arrangement  is  allocated to the license fee
using the residual method and revenue is primarily recognized when the software
has been delivered and there are no remaining  obligations  revenue from pcs is
recognized ratably over the term of the pcs agreement

allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns

our accounts  receivable  balance  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  was
1239  million as of december  31  2004  compared  with 1046  million as of
january 2 2004 the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december 31 2004 was
90 million compared with 100 million as of january 2 2004 we evaluate the
collectibility  of our trade  accounts  receivable  based on a number of factors
such as age of the accounts  receivable  balances  credit  quality  historical
experience and current economic conditions that may affect a customers ability
to pay in circumstances where we are aware of a specific  customers  inability
to meet its financial  obligations to us a specific  allowance for bad debts is
estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized  receivable to the estimated
amount we believe will ultimately be collected in addition to specific customer
identification  of potential bad debts  bad debt charges are recorded  based on
our  recent  past  loss  history  and an  overall  assessment  of past due trade
accounts receivable amounts outstanding

a reserve for sales returns is established based on historical trends in product
return rates  experienced  in the ordinary  course of business  the reserve for
sales  returns as of december 31 2004 and january 2 2004 included 22 million
and 33 million  respectively for estimated future returns that were recorded
as a reduction of our accounts  receivable  and  revenue  if the actual  future
returns were to deviate from the  historical  data on which the reserve had been
established our revenue could be adversely affected

inventory valuation

our inventories net balance was 877 million as of december 31 2004 compared
with  708  million  as of january 2  2004  our  inventory  allowances  as of
december 31 2004 were 262 million  compared with 259 million as of january
2 2004  our inventory is recorded at the lower of standard cost or market net
realizable  value  we generally use a standard cost accounting system to value
inventory and these standards are reviewed a minimum of once a year and multiple
times a year in our most active  manufacturing  plants  we adjust the inventory
value based on estimated excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by
future demand  forecasts  if actual future demand or market conditions are less
favorable than those projected by us  additional  inventory  writedowns may be
required

income taxes

income taxes are accounted for under the liability  method whereby  deferred tax
asset or liability  account  balances are  calculated  at the balance sheet date
using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences
are  expected to affect  taxable  income  a valuation  allowance is recorded to
reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not
that such assets will not be realized

the  valuation  allowance  decreased  by 218  million in fiscal 2004 and 131
million in fiscal 2003  approximately 8 million of the valuation  allowance at
december  31  2004 and 141  million  at  january  2 2004  relates to the tax
benefit of stock option deductions which will be credited to equity if and when
realized  in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we consider future
taxable  income  resolution of tax  uncertainties  and prudent and feasible tax
planning strategies

goodwill impairment

goodwill  as of  december  31  2004 was 2595  million  compared  with 2414
million as of january 2 2004 we performed goodwill impairment tests at the end
of the fiscal third quarter of 2004 and 2003 for each  reporting  unit and found
there was no  impairment  of our  goodwill  we will  continue to  evaluate  our
goodwill  for  impairment  on an annual  basis at the end of each  fiscal  third
quarter  and  whenever  events and  changes in  circumstances  suggest  that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable

for  goodwill  the annual  impairment  evaluation  includes a comparison of the
carrying  value of the reporting  unit  including  goodwill to that  reporting
units fair value  if the  reporting  units  estimated  fair value exceeds the
reporting units carrying value no impairment of goodwill  exists  if the fair
value of the reporting unit does not exceed the units carrying  value  then an
additional  analysis is performed  to allocate  the fair value of the  reporting
unit to all of the assets and  liabilities of that unit as if that unit had been
acquired  in a  business  combination  and the  fair  value  of the unit was the
purchase  price  if the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the

page

fair value of the identifiable  assets and liabilities is less than the carrying
value  of the  units  goodwill  an  impairment  charge  is  recorded  for  the
difference

we cannot predict the  occurrence of certain future events that might  adversely
affect the reported value of goodwill  such events include but are not limited
to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions
the impact of the  economic  environment  on our  customer  base  or a material
negative change in our relationships with significant customers

accounting for longlived assets including intangibles subject to amortization

depreciation  and  amortization  of our  longlived  assets  is  provided  using
straightline   methods  over  their   estimated   useful   lives   changes  in
circumstances  such as the  passage  of new  laws  or  changes  in  regulations
technological advances changes to our business model or changes in the capital
strategy  could  result  in the  actual  useful  lives  differing  from  initial
estimates  in  those  cases  where  we  determine  that  the  useful  life of a
longlived  asset should be revised  we will  depreciate  the net book value in
excess of the estimated  residual value over its revised  remaining useful life
factors  such as changes in the planned use of  equipment  customer  attrition
contractual  amendments  or mandated  regulatory  requirements  could result in
shortened useful lives

longlived assets and asset groups are evaluated for impairment  whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may
not be recoverable  the estimated future cash flows are based upon among other
things  assumptions about expected future operating  performance and may differ
from actual cash flows  longlived  assets evaluated for impairment are grouped
with other  assets to the  lowest  level for which  identifiable  cash flows are
largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities
if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less
than the  carrying  value of the assets  the assets will be written down to the
estimated fair value in the period in which the determination is made

warranty costs

the liability for product  warranties  was 64 million as of december 31 2004
compared  with 51  million as of january 2 2004  see note 2 of the notes to
the  consolidated  financial  statements for further  information  regarding our
warranty liability the warranty periods for our products are generally between
one and three years  selected  military  programs may require extended warranty
periods  up to 55  years  certain  tds  products  have a five  year or  90day
warranty period and certain nikon products have a five year warranty period we
accrue  for  warranty  costs as part of our cost of  sales  based on  associated
material  costs  technical  support  labor costs  and costs  incurred by third
parties  performing  warranty  work on our behalf  our expected  future cost is
primarily  estimated  based  upon  historical  trends in the  volume of  product
returns  within  the  warranty  period  and the cost to  repair or  replace  the
equipment

while we engage in extensive  product quality programs and processes  including
actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component  suppliers  our
warranty  obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage  and
service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product  failure  should actual
product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from our
estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty accrual and related costs may be
required

stock compensation

we apply  accounting  principles  board  opinion no 25  accounting  for stock
issued to employees apb 25 and related  interpretations in accounting for our
stock option plans and stock  purchase  plan  accordingly  we do not recognize
compensation  cost for stock  options  granted at a price  equal to fair  market
value note 15 of the notes to the consolidated  financial  statements describes
the  plans we  operate  and note 2 of the notes to the  consolidated  financial
statements  contains a summary of the pro forma  effects to reported  net income
and earnings per share for fiscal 2004  2003  and 2002 as if we had elected to
recognize  compensation  cost based on the fair value of the options  granted at
grant date

investment in joint ventures

we have  adopted the equity  method of  accounting  for our  investments  in the
caterpillar and nikon joint ventures  this requires that we record our share of
the joint  ventures  profits or losses in a given fiscal period  see note 5 of
the notes to the consolidated financial statements for joint venture accounting

upon the formation of our caterpillar joint venture in april 2002 we received a
cash  distribution  of  110  million  we  have  elected  to  treat  the  cash
distribution  as a deferred gain  being amortized to the extent that losses are
attributable  from  the  caterpillar  joint  venture  under  the  equity  method
described  above  when and if the joint  venture is profitable on a sustainable
basis and future operating losses are not anticipated then we will recognize as
a gain the portion of the 110 million  which is  unamortized  to the extent
that it is possible that we will have any futurefunding  obligation relating to
the  caterpillar  joint venture  then the relevant  amount of the 110 million
will be deferred  until such time that the funding  obligation no longer exists
as of december 31 2004 the balance of the  unamortized  deferred gain was 92
million

basis of presentation

we have a 5253 week fiscal year  ending on the friday  nearest to december 31
which for fiscal 2004 was december  31  2004  fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 were
52week  years and fiscal 2002 a 53week  year as a result of the extra week in
fiscal 2002 yearoveryear results are not exactly comparable thus due to the
inherent  nature of adopting a 5253 week fiscal year  the  company  analysts
shareholders investors and others will have to make appropriate adjustments to
any analysis performed when comparing our activities and results in fiscal years
that contain 53 weeks to those that contain the standard 52 weeks

impact of weaker us dollar on operating results in fiscal 2004

the  depreciation of the us dollar versus major european  currencies  positively
impacted  revenues by  approximately  126 million in fiscal 2004 when compared
with  rates  used  throughout  fiscal  2003  as a  result  of  our  significant
manufacturing  distribution  research and  development  and selling  expenses
incurred  outside  of the us  the  weaker us  dollar  negatively  impacted  our
operating income by approximately 30 million in fiscal 2004 when compared with
rates used throughout fiscal 2003

revenue

in fiscal 2004  total  revenue  increased by 1279  million or 236 to 6688
million  from 5409  million in fiscal  2003  the  increase in fiscal 2004 was
primarily due to stronger  performances in most of our operating segments driven
by the new product  offerings and increased  penetration in the markets we serve
primarily   engineering  and  construction  and  field   solutions   expanded
distribution  and  selective   acquisitions   primarily  mobile  solutions  and
portfolio technologies  as well the positive impact of the weaker us dollar on
revenues generated in foreign  currencies  primarily the euro total revenue in
fiscal 2003  increased by 743  million or 159 to 5409  million from 4666
million in fiscal  2002  this  increase was  primarily  due to the same factors
outlined  above  as  all  of  our  operating  segments   demonstrated   stronger
performances versus prior periods

 total revenue outside the united states comprised  approximately  50 in 2004
51 in 2003  and 49 in 2002  during  the 2004  fiscal  year  north and south
america represented 57 europe the middle east and africa represented 30 and
asia  represented  13 of total  revenues  in fiscal  2004  the united  states
comprised  approximately  50 of total  revenues  we  anticipate  that sales to
international  customers  will continue to account for a significant  portion of
our revenue

 no single  customer  accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues in fiscal
2004  2003  and 2002  it is  possible  however  that in future  periods the
failure  of one or more large  customers  to  purchase  products  in  quantities
anticipated by us may adversely affect the results of operations

gross margin

our gross  margin  varies  due to a number of  factors  including  product  mix
pricing  distribution  channel  used  the effects of production  volumes  new
product  startup costs and foreign  currency  translations  gross margin as a
percentage of total revenues was 486  in fiscal 2004 and 496 in fiscal 2003
the decrease in gross margin  percentage  for fiscal 2004  compared with fiscal
2003  was due to changes in the mix of products  sold  principally  related to
increased sales of lower margin nikonbranded survey and construction  products
our  agriculture  products  pricing  pressure  in  our  component  technologies
business  which  typically  demonstrates  increased  unit volumes  coupled with
declining  unit  prices  the  impact  of the  weaker  us  dollar on our non us
manufacturing and distribution costs

gross  margin as a  percentage  of total  revenues  was 496 in fiscal 2003 and
502 in fiscal 2002 the slight decrease in gross margin  percentage for fiscal
2003  compared with fiscal 2002 was due primarily to the  introduction  of the
nikon products in the third quarter  which was responsible for a margin decline
of  approximately  08 this was partially offset by stronger sales of handheld
survey products  gis wireless  infrastructure  survey products as well as our
ongoing focus on product cost reductions

 because  of  potential  product  mix  changes  within  and among the  industry
markets  market  pressures  on  unit  selling  prices   fluctuations  in  unit
manufacturing costs  including increases in component prices and other factors

current level gross margins  cannot be assured  in addition  should the global
economic  conditions  deteriorate  gross  margin  could  be  further  adversely
impacted

operating income

operating  income as a  percentage  of total  revenue  was 128 in fiscal  2004
compared to 10 in fiscal 2003 and 72 in fiscal  2002  the increase is driven
by  disciplined  management  of operating  expenses and greater  leverage due to
revenue growth  the operating  expenses  represented  358 of total revenue in
fiscal 2004 as compared to 396 in fiscal 2003

results by segment

to achieve distribution marketing production and technology advantages in our
targeted  markets  we manage our  operations  in the following  five  segments
engineering and construction  field solutions  component technologies  mobile
solutions  and portfolio  technologies  operating income loss is net revenue
less operating expenses  excluding general corporate expenses  amortization of
purchased intangibles  restructuring  charges  nonoperating income expense
and income taxes

engineering and construction

engineering and  construction  revenues  increased by 734 million or 20 while
segment  operating income increased by 188 million or 311 for fiscal 2004 as
compared  to fiscal  2003  the  relatively  strong  environment  of fiscal 2003
continued  into fiscal 2004  resulting in continued  robust  demand for survey
machine  control  and laser  products  in addition  the full year effects for
nikonbranded products contributed to the year over year increase  targeted new
product introductions  such as the 5500 servo driven station provided improved
market penetration  the weaker us dollar also contributed to increased revenues
in this  operating  segment  operating  income  increased at a higher rate than
revenue growth due to greater operating leverage on expenses

engineering and construction revenues increased by 474 million or 148 during
fiscal  2003 as  compared  to fiscal  2002  approximately  half of the  revenue
increase was driven by new product  introductions  and our  increased  marketing
efforts  the remaining increase was split evenly between geographic  expansion
especially in asia and russia  and the impact of the weaker us dollar  segment
operating  income increased due to higher revenues that were partially offset by
increased  operating  expenses  outside the united states largely driven by the
weaker us  dollar  increased  research  and  development  spending  on certain
programs as we continue to invest in developing next generation technology  and
lower margins earned on the sale of nikon products  overall  segment operating
income remained consistent at 17 of revenues

field solutions

field solutions revenues increased by approximately 257 million or 322 while
segment  operating  income  increased by 107  million or 735 for fiscal year
2004 as compared to fiscal  2003  revenues  increased  primarily as a result of
higher  demand  for  both  automated  and  manual   guidance   products  in  the
agricultural  market in particular  revenues were enhanced by the introduction
of ezguider plus  we saw increases in our gis product lines due to increases
in our dealer and  distributor  business  additionally  programs  designed  to
expand our distribution channel by supplementing  adding valueadded  solutions
focused business partners to our traditional dealer profile were successful  in
addition  we saw  improved  results in europe and  increased  opportunities  in
china  increases  in segment  operating  income  were  primarily  due to higher
revenues

field solutions revenues increased by approximately 126 million or 188 while
segment operating income increased by 48 million or 499 for fiscal year 2003
as compared to fiscal  2002  revenues  were up year over year due to  continued
strong sales of the  geoexplorerr  ce series handhelds  released at the end of
fiscal 2002  and due to the expansion of our automatic  guidance  products onto
new agricultural vehicles

segment  operating  income increased in 2003 from the fiscal year 2002 primarily
due to higher revenues this increase was partially offset by fractionally lower
gross  margins  and more  investment  in  research  and  development  and  sales
functions this enabled the segment operating income to increase from 14 to 18
of revenues

page

component technologies

component technologies revenues increased by 13 million or 21 while segment
operating  income decreased by 27 million or 162 for the fiscal year 2004 as
compared to fiscal 2003  revenues increased primarily due to higher demand from
vehicle  navigation and tracking  customers  partially offset by the decline in
demand from wireless  infrastructure  customers  the segment  operating  income
decrease was primarily due to pricing pressures from the embedded and invehicle
navigation  product lines a less favorable product mix and increased  spending
for development of new categories of products

component technologies revenues increased by 44 million or 74 while segment
operating  income increased by 59 million or 552 for the fiscal year 2003 as
compared to fiscal 2002 the increase in revenues was primarily due to increased
demand from our existing wireless  infrastructure  customers  segment operating
income increased from 18 to 26 of revenues  the increase was primarily due to
a reduction in costs of goods sold due to the transfer of the  manufacturing  of
our products to china  reduced costs of raw materials  increased  revenues and
higher margins aided by favorable product mix

mobile solutions

mobile  solutions  revenues  increased by 106  million or 813 in fiscal 2004
over  fiscal  2003 due  primarily  to  increases  sales  into  the  construction
materials market higher dealer sales and a significant  enterprise sale during
the first quarter of fiscal 2004 we completed the  acquisition  of tracernet to

higher fleet management  services  revenues as a result of an expanded  customer
base  segment  operating loss decreased by 56 million or 464 in fiscal 2003
over  fiscal  2002 due to  increased  revenues  and  lower  operating  expenses

us dollar on non us operating expenses were approximately 76 million

research  and  development  expenses  increased  by 99  million in fiscal 2004
compared to fiscal 2003  primarily  due to sustaining  engineering  expenses and
costs incurred related to new product development  continued investment in next
generation technologies and the effect of foreign currency fluctuations

research  and  development  expenses  increased  by 64  million in fiscal 2003
compared  to  fiscal  2002  due  to  continued  investment  in  next  generation
technology  primarily in the engineering and construction  segment the weakness
of the us dollar versus major european and new zealand currencies  and also the
inclusion of the research  and  development  expenses  from  applanix  after its
acquisition in july 2003

  overall  spending  remained  relatively  constant  at  approximately  13  of
revenues  we expect to continue to devote  resources to the  development of new
products and the enhancement of existing products  we believe that research and
development is critical to our strategic product development objectives and that
to leverage our leading  technology  and meet the changing  requirements  of our
customers  we will need to fund investments in several development  projects in
parallel

sales and marketing  expenses increased by 102 million in fiscal 2004 compared
to fiscal 2003  but decreased as a percent of total  revenues  the majority of
the increase was due to the increase in revenue promotional programs associated
with new  products  and the foreign  exchange  impact on expenses in our non us
operations

sales and marketing  expenses  increased by 85 million in fiscal 2003 compared
to fiscal 2002 primarily due to higher  revenue  increased sales efforts mostly
in emerging  geographic areas such as china and russia the impact of the weaker

not applicable in the prior fiscal year

 we intend to  continue  to focus and  expand our sales and  marketing  efforts
across all the  geographies  and  markets we serve in order to  increase  market
awareness  of  our  products  and  to  better  support  our  existing  customers

revenues

general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2003 decreased by 14 million and
represented 73 of revenues  compared with 87 in fiscal 2002 in fiscal 2002
we experienced  higher bad debt  expenses  primarily due to the bankruptcy of a
large japanese distributor in addition in fiscal 2003 we incurred 30 million
less in information  systems  expenses  these  reductions were offset in fiscal
2003 by lower  sublease  income  received  expenses  from  applanix  after  the
acquisition in july 2003 and higher compensation costs

other operating expenses

nonoperating  expense  net decreased by 76 million or 42 during fiscal 2004
as compared with fiscal 2003 primarily due to lower  interest  expense after the
repayment of the  principal  balance of a  subordinated  note in june 2003  the
write  off of 23  million  of debt  issuance  costs  as a  result  of our debt
refinancing  in june  2003 and 13  million  related  to the  write  off of the
remaining  unamortized  portion  of  the  warrants  issued  to  spectra  physics
holdings inc the increases in expense for affiliated operations were primarily
due to our higher  construction  machine control revenues which led to increased
impact from the pricing effects of  transactions  between us and the caterpillar
joint venture see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements
for financial information  regarding joint ventures  this was partially offset
by 11  million  related  to our share of profits  in the  nikontrimble  joint
venture  the increase in other income expense was primarily due to a net gain
related to the sale of an investment

nonoperating expense net decreased by 16 million or 8 during fiscal 2003 as
compared with fiscal 2002  primarily  due to a reduction in interest  expense of
28 million  offset by an increase in expenses for affiliated  operations  the
increase in expenses for affiliated operations is primarily due to the full year
impact  of  transfer  pricing  effects  on  transactions   between  us  and  our
caterpillar  joint  venture  which  commenced  operations  in  april  2002  in
addition  we recorded  approximately  03 million relating to our share of the
losses in our nikon joint venture established in 2003

in fiscal 2003  interest expense decreased by approximately 28 million due to
continued  debt  repayment  during  the  year of  approximately  518  million
combined  with the effect of lower  interest  rates  offsetting  the lower debt
interest  during the year we recorded  approximately  36 million of interest
expense due to the write off of 23 million of unamortized  debt issuance costs
as a result  of our  debt  refinancing  in june  2003  as well as 13  million
related to the  unamortized  portion of warrants  associated  with the principal

income tax provision

our  effective  income tax rates for fiscal years 2004  2003 and 2002 were 10
8 and 25 respectively  the fiscal 2002 income tax rate differs from the us
federal statutory rate of 35 due primarily to nonus taxes and the inability to
realize the benefit of net operating losses  the 2004 and 2003 income tax rates
are less than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to the realization of
benefits from net operating  losses and other previously  reserved  deferred tax
assets

 we expect our  effective  income tax rate to go up in fiscal year 2005 because
of the significant  realization of the valuation allowance for deferred taxes in
fiscal  year  2004  the  company  expects  its  effective  income  tax  rate to
approximate 35

 in october  2004  the american  jobs creation act of 2004 was signed into law
providing   changes  in  the  tax  law  including  an  incentive  to  repatriate
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries  we are currently evaluating the
potential  impact of these  provisions  including  assessing the details of the
act analyzing the funds available for repatriation  the economic cost of doing
so and assessing the qualified uses of  repatriated  funds  however  given the
preliminary stage of our evaluation  it is not possible to determine the impact
to our fiscal year 2005 income tax  provision  the company  expects to complete
its evaluation by september 30 2005

1  we have  reclassified  deferred  revenues  previously  included in accounts
     receivable  net to the  liabilities  section in the  consolidated  balance
     sheets in fiscal year 2004 and for all periods presented  as such the dso
     calculation for all fiscal periods has been restated

cash and cash equivalents

in fiscal 2004  our cash and cash  equivalents  increased by 265 million from
fiscal  2003  the  increase was  primarily  due to cash  generated by operating
activities   partially  offset  by  cash  used  in  investing   activities  for
acquisitions and cash used in financing activities for debt repayment

page

in fiscal 2004  cash provided by operating  activities  was 731  million  as
compared to 365  million in fiscal  2003  the  increase of 367  million was
primarily  driven by the 292 million increase in net income during fiscal 2004
compared to fiscal 2003 and better management of working capital our ability to
continue  to  generate  cash  from  operations  will  depend  in  large  part on
profitability  the rate of  collections of accounts  receivable  our inventory
turns  and our ability to manage other areas of working  capital  our accounts
receivable  days  for  sales  outstanding  decreased  from 65 days at the end of
fiscal  2003 to 61 days at the end of  fiscal  2004  our  inventory  turns  was
unchanged at four at the end of fiscal 2004 and 2003

cash used in investing  activities  was 251 million in fiscal 2004 as compared
to 227  million  in  fiscal  2003  the  increase  was  primarily  due to cash
acquisitions and investment in capital  equipment  during fiscal 2004 we spent
approximately 128 million on capital expenditures

cash used in financing  activities  was 242 million in fiscal 2004 as compared
to 54000 in fiscal 2003 however  during fiscal 2004 we repaid approximately
652  million  of debt  related to our  previous  credit  facility  these debt
payments were funded by cash provided by operating activities  and the issuance
of common  stock to  employees  pursuant to our stock  option plan and  employee
stock purchase plan of approximately 268 million

 we  believe  that  our cash and cash  equivalents  together  with our  credit
facilities  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for
at least the next twelve  months  at december 31 2004 we had 719 million of
cash and cash  equivalents  as well as access to 118  million of cash under the
terms of our revolver loans

 we expect fiscal 2005 capital  expenditures to be approximately 14 million to
15 million primarily for computer equipment software manufacturing tools and
test equipment  and leasehold improvements  associated with business expansion
decisions  related to how much cash is used for investing are  influenced by the
expected amount of cash to be provided by operations

debt

at the end of fiscal  2004  our total  debt was  approximately  39  million as
compared  with  approximately  905  million  at the end of fiscal  2003  this
balance primarily consists of 313 million outstanding under a term loan and 7
million  outstanding under a senior secured  revolving credit facility  on june
25  2003  we  obtained a new credit  facility  comprising  of a term loan and
revolver  in the  amount  of  109  million  that  enabled  us to pay  off  our
indebtedness  under our previous credit facility and a subordinated note used to
finance the spectra physics acquisition

the new credit facility is secured by all material assets of our company except
for a portion of assets that are not pledged due to foreign tax  considerations
financial  covenants of the credit facility include leverage  fixed charge and
minimum net worth tests at december 31 2004 and as of the date of this report
we are in compliance with all debt covenants the amortized principal interest
and commitment fees due under the credit facility are paid quarterly  under the
fouryear term loan portion of the credit facility  we are due to make payments
excluding  interest  of  approximately  125  million in each of the next two
fiscal years 2005 and 2006 and 63 million in fiscal 2007

under the terms of the credit  facility  we are  allowed to pay  dividends  and
repurchase  shares of our common  stock up to 25 of net income in the  previous
fiscal year for  additional  discussion of our debt see note 9 of notes to the
consolidated financial statements

1 total excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our balance sheet
as current liabilities or certain obligations as discussed below

 as of  december  31  2004  226  million of our total  debt was  subject to
variable quarterly interest rates per our loan agreement  we pay a threemonth
libor rate plus a certain spread that depends on our leverage ratio  our spread
is expected to be 15 over the  remaining  life of the debt  we have assumed a
threemonth  libor rate of 256 for the first  quarter of fiscal  2005 and have
forecasted  an increase of 25 basis point  quarter  over quarter to a maximum of
481  see note 9 of the notes to the  consolidated  financial  statements for
further financial information regarding longterm debt

other purchase  obligations and  commitments  represent open purchase orders for
material  purchases  with  our  customers  and a  forecasted  commitment  with a
supplier  for  outsourced  services as  described in note 10 of the notes to the
consolidated financial statements  our pension obligation which is not included
in the table above  and is included in other  noncurrent  liabilities on our
consolidated  balance  sheets  is  disclosed  at  note 16 of the  notes  to the
consolidated financial statements

new accounting standards

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r sharebased payment sfas no
123r requires  employee stock options and rights to purchase  shares under stock
participation  plans to be  accounted  for  under  the fair  value  method  and
eliminates  the ability to account  for these  instruments  under the  intrinsic
value method  prescribed  by apb opinion no 25 and allowed  under the original
provisions of sfas no 123 sfas no 123r requires the use of an option  pricing
model for estimating fair value  which is amortized to expense over the service
periods  the  requirements  of sfas no 123r are effective  for fiscal  periods
beginning after june 15 2005 if we had applied the provisions of sfas no 123r
to the financial  statements for the period ending  december 31 2004  assuming
that  adoption  would  result  in  amounts  similar  to the  current  pro  forma
disclosures under sfas 123r net income would have been reduced by approximately
86  million  sfas no  123r  allows for  either  prospective  recognition  of
compensation  expense  or  retrospective  recognition  which may be back to the
original  issuance  of sfas no  123 or only to  interim  periods in the year of
adoption we are currently evaluating these transition methods

risks and uncertainties

you should  carefully  consider the following  risk factors  in addition to the
other  information  contained  in this form 10k and in any other  documents  to
which we refer you in this form 10k  before  purchasing  our  securities  the
risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face

our inability to accurately predict orders and shipments may affect our revenue
expenses and earnings per share

we have not been able in the past to  consistently  predict  when our  customers
will place orders and request shipments so that we cannot always accurately plan
our manufacturing requirements as a result if orders and shipments differ from

page

what we predict  we may incur additional  expenses and build excess  inventory
which may require additional reserves and allowances  any significant change in
our customers  purchasing  patterns could have a material adverse effect on our
operating results and reported earnings per share for a particular quarter

our  operating  results in each  quarter may be affected by special  conditions
such as  seasonality  late  quarter  purchases  weather  and other  potential
issues

due in part to the buying  patterns of our customers  a significant  portion of
our quarterly  revenues occurs from orders  received and immediately  shipped to
customers in the last few weeks and days of each quarter although our operating
expenses  tend  to  remain  fairly  predictable  engineering  and  construction
purchases  tend to occur in early  spring  and  governmental  agencies  tend to
utilize  funds  available  at the  end  of  the  governments  fiscal  year  for
additional purchases at the end of our third fiscal quarter in september of each
year  concentrations of orders sometimes also occur at the end of our other two
fiscal quarters  additionally  a majority of our sales force earns commissions
on a quarterly basis which may cause  concentrations of orders at the end of any
fiscal quarter  if for any reason  expected sales are deferred  orders are not
received  or  shipments  are  delayed a few days at the end of a  quarter  our
operating  results and reported  earnings  per share for that  quarter  could be
significantly impacted

we are  dependent  on a  specific  manufacturer  and  assembler  for many of our
products and on specific suppliers of critical parts for our products

we are substantially  dependent upon solectron corporation in california  china
and mexico as our preferred  manufacturing  partner for many of our gps products
previously  manufactured  out of our sunnyvale  facilities  under the agreement
with  solectron  we provide to solectron a  twelvemonth  product  forecast and
place purchase orders with solectron at least thirty calendar days in advance of
the scheduled delivery of products to our customers depending on production lead
time  although purchase orders placed with solectron are cancelable  the terms
of the agreement  would require us to purchase from  solectron all inventory not
returnable  or  usable  by  other  solectron  customers   accordingly   if  we
inaccurately  forecast  demand  for our  products  we may be  unable  to obtain
adequate  manufacturing  capacity  from  solectron to meet  customers  delivery
requirements or we may accumulate  excess  inventories  if such inventories are
not usable by other solectron customers

our current contract with solectron continues in effect until either party gives
the other ninety days written notice

in  addition  we  rely on  specific  suppliers  for a  number  of our  critical
components we have experienced shortages of components in the past our current
reliance on specific or a limited  group of suppliers  involves  several  risks
including  a  potential  inability  to obtain  an  adequate  supply of  required
components and reduced  control over pricing  any inability to obtain  adequate
deliveries or any other  circumstance  that would require us to seek alternative
sources  of  supply  or  to  manufacture   such  components   internally   could
significantly  delay  our  ability  to ship our  products  which  could  damage
relationships  with  current  and  prospective  customers  and  could  harm  our
reputation and brand and could have a material adverse effect on our business

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate

our  operating  results  have  fluctuated  and can be  expected  to  continue to
fluctuate in the future on a quarterly  and annual basis as a result of a number
of factors many of which are beyond our control results in any period could be
affected by

o    changes in market demand
o    competitive market conditions
o    market acceptance of existing or new products
o    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
o    the cost and availability of components
o    our ability to manufacture and ship products
o    the mix of our customer base and sales channels
o    the mix of products sold
o    our ability to expand our sales and marketing organization effectively
o    our ability to attract and retain key technical and managerial employees
o    the timing of shipments of products under contracts and
o    general global economic conditions

page

in addition  demand for our products in any quarter or year may vary due to the
seasonal  buying patterns of our customers in the  agricultural  and engineering
and construction industries due to the foregoing factors our operating results
in one or  more  future  periods  are  expected  to be  subject  to  significant
fluctuations  the price of our common stock could decline  substantially in the
event such  fluctuations  result in our  financial  performance  being below the
expectations of public market analysts and investors  which are based primarily
on historical models that are not necessarily  accurate  representations  of the
future

our gross margin is subject to fluctuation

our gross  margin is  affected by a number of factors  including  product  mix
product  pricing  cost of  components  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  and
manufacturing costs for example sales of nikonbranded products generally have
lower  gross  margins as  compared  to our gps  survey  products  absent  other
factors  a shift  in  sales  towards  nikonbranded  products  would  lead to a
reduction  in our  overall  gross  margins  a  decline  in gross  margin  could
potentially negatively impact our earnings per share

failure to maintain  effective  internal controls in compliance with section 404
of the sarbanesoxley act could have an adverse effect on our business and stock
price

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act requires us to include an internal control
report of  management  in our  annual  report on form 10k  for fiscal  2004 we
satisfied the  requirements  of section 404  which requires  annual  management
assessments  of  the  effectiveness  of our  internal  controls  over  financial
reporting and a report by our independent auditors addressing these assessments

a system of  controls  however  well  designed  and  operated  cannot  provide
absolute  assurance  that the objectives of the system will be met in addition
the design of a control system is based in part upon certain  assumptions  about
the likelihood of future events  because of the inherent limitations of control
systems  there is only  reasonable  assurance that our controls will succeed in
achieving their stated goals under all potential future conditions

we are dependent on new products

our future  revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to bring new
products  to market on a timely  basis  we must  continue  to make  significant
investments  in  research  and  development  in order to continue to develop new
products  enhance  existing  products  and achieve  market  acceptance  of such
products  we may incur problems in the future in innovating and introducing new
products  our development stage products may not be successfully  completed or
if developed may not achieve significant customer acceptance if we were unable
to successfully  define  develop and introduce  competitive  new products  and
enhance existing  products  our future results of operations would be adversely
affected  development and manufacturing  schedules for technology  products are
difficult to predict and we might not achieve timely initial customer shipments
of new products  the timely  availability of these products in volume and their
acceptance  by customers  are  important to our future  success  a delay in new
product  introductions  could  have  a  significant  impact  on our  results  of
operations

our products may contain errors or defects  which could result in damage to our
reputation  lost revenues diverted development resources and increased service
costs warranty claims and litigation

our devices are complex and must meet  stringent  requirements  we warrant that
our products  will be free of defect for various  periods of time  depending on
the product  in addition  certain of our contracts  include  epidemic  failure
clauses if invoked  these clauses may entitle the customer to return or obtain
credits for products and inventory  or to cancel  outstanding  purchase  orders
even if the products themselves are not defective

we must  develop our  products  quickly to keep pace with the  rapidly  changing
market and we have a history of frequently  introducing new products  products
and  services  as  sophisticated  as ours  could  contain  undetected  errors or
defects  especially  when first  introduced  or when new models or versions are
released  in general our products may not be free from errors or defects after
commercial shipments have begun which could result in damage to our reputation
lost revenues  diverted development  resources  increased customer service and
support costs and warranty claims and litigation  which could harm our business
results of operations and financial condition

page

we may not be able to enter into or maintain important alliances

we believe that in certain business opportunities our success will depend on our
ability to form and  maintain  alliances  with  industry  participants  such as
caterpillar  nikon  mcneilus and cnh global our failure to form and maintain
such  alliances  or the  preemption  of such  alliances  by  actions  of other
competitors  or us  will  adversely  affect our ability to  penetrate  emerging
markets  no assurances can be given that we will not  experience  problems from
current  or  future  alliances  or that we will  realize  value  from  any  such
strategic alliances

we are  dependent  on the  availability  of  allocated  bands  within  the radio
frequency spectrum

our gps technology is dependent on the use of the standard  positioning  service
sps  provided  by the us  governments  gps  the gps sps  operates in radio
frequency  bands that are  globally  allocated  for radio  navigation  satellite
services   international  allocations  of  radio  frequency  are  made  by  the
international  telecommunications  union itu a specialized technical agency
of  the  united  nations  these  allocations  are  further  governed  by  radio
regulations  that have  treaty  status and which may be subject to  modification
every two to three years by the world radio communication conference

any  itu  reallocation  of  radio  frequency  bands  including  frequency  band
segmentation  or sharing of spectrum  may materially  and adversely  affect the
utility and reliability of our products  which would in turn cause a material
adverse  effect on our operating  results  many of our products use other radio
frequency  bands  together  with  the  gps  signal  to  provide  enhanced  gps
capabilities such as realtime kinematic precision the continuing availability
of these nongps radio frequencies is essential to provide enhanced gps products
to  our  precision  survey  and  construction   machine  controls  markets  any
regulatory changes in spectrum allocation or in allowable  operating  conditions
may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products
which would in turn cause a material adverse effect on our operating results

in  addition  unwanted  emissions  from  mobile  satellite  services  and other
equipment  operating in adjacent  frequency  bands or inband from  licensed and
unlicensed   devices  may  materially  and  adversely  affect  the  utility  and
reliability of our products  which could result in a material adverse effect on
our  operating  results  the  fcc  continually  receives  proposals  for  novel
technologies and services such as ultrawideband  technologies  which may seek
to operate in or across  the radio  frequency  bands currently used by the gps
sps and other public safety services  adverse  decisions by the fcc that result
in harmful interference to the delivery of the gps sps and other radio frequency
spectrum  also used in our  products may  materially  and  adversely  affect the
utility  and  reliability  of our  products  which  could  result in a material
adverse effect on our business and financial condition

we are subject to the adverse impact of radio frequency congestion

we have certain  products  such as gps rtk systems  and  surveying and mapping
systems that use integrated radio communication  technology  requiring access to
available  radio  frequencies  allocated  by the fcc or the ntia in the case of
federal  government  users of this equipment for which the end user is required
to obtain a license in order to operate their equipment in addition  access to
these  frequencies  by  state  agencies  is  under  management  by  state  radio
communications  coordinators   some  bands  are  experiencing  congestion  that
excludes  their  availability  for access by state  agencies in some states  to
reduce  congestion  the fcc announced  that it will require  migration of radio
technology  from wideband to narrowband  operations in these bands  in december
2003  the fcc  stayed  the  effectiveness  of its new  rules  until  it acts on
petitions  requesting a  reconsideration  of this new  requirement  the stay is
indefinite  at this point and the outcome of this  proceeding is unknown at this
time an inability to obtain access to these radio frequencies by end users and
for new products to comply with fcc  requirements  could have an adverse effect
on our operating results

many of our products rely on the gps satellite system

the gps  satellites  and their  ground  support  systems are complex  electronic
systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage the
satellites were  originally  designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject
to damage by the hostile space  environment in which they operate  however  of
the current  deployment  of 29  satellites  in place  some have already been in
operation  for 12 years  to repair  damaged  or  malfunctioning  satellites  is
currently not economically  feasible if a significant number of satellites were
to  become  inoperable  there  could be a  substantial  delay  before  they are
replaced with new satellites  a reduction in the number of operating satellites

page

may impair the  current  utility of the gps system and the growth of current and
additional market opportunities

in  addition  there can be no  assurance  that the us  government  will  remain
committed to the operation and maintenance of gps satellites over a long period
or that the policies of the us government for the use of gps without charge will
remain  unchanged  however  a 1996 presidential  decision  directive marks the
first time in the  evolution  of gps that access for civilian use free of direct
user fees is  specifically  recognized  and  supported  by  presidential  policy
reaffirmed in 2004 in addition  presidential  policy has been  complemented by
corresponding   legislation   signed  into  law  because  of   everincreasing
commercial applications of gps other us government agencies may become involved
in the  administration  or the regulation of the use of gps signals  any of the
foregoing  factors  could  affect the  willingness  of buyers of our products to
select gpsbased systems instead of products based on competing technologies

many of our products also use signals from systems that augment gps such as the
wide area  augmentation  system  waas  and  national  differential  gps system
ndgps  many  of  these  augmentation  systems  are  operated  by the  federal
government and rely on continued  funding and maintenance of these systems  any
curtailment  of the  operating  capability  of these  systems  could  result  in
decreased user capability thereby impacting our markets

the european  governments  have begun  development of an  independent  satellite
navigation  system  known as  galileo  we believe  we will have  access to the
signal design to develop compatible receivers  however if access to the signal
structure is delayed it may have a materially adverse effect on our business and
operating results

our  business  is  subject to  disruptions  and  uncertainties  caused by war or
terrorism

acts of war or acts of  terrorism  could have a material  adverse  impact on our
business  operating results and financial  condition  the threat of terrorism
and war and  heightened  security and military  response to this threat  or any
future acts of terrorism may cause further disruption to our economy and create
further  uncertainties  to the extent that such  disruptions  or  uncertainties
result in delays or cancellations  of orders  or the manufacture or shipment of
our products our business  operating results and financial condition could be
materially and adversely affected

our credit agreement contains financial covenants

on june 25 2003 we executed a credit agreement with scotia capital and certain
other  banks  which  provides  for  financial  commitments  totaling  up to 175
million  this credit facility contains  financial  covenants  regarding minimum
fixed charge coverage and maximum  leverage ratio which are extremely  sensitive
to changes in earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization or
ebitda  in turn  ebitda is highly  correlated  to  revenues  and costs  if we
default  on one or more  covenants  we will  have to obtain  either  negotiated
waivers or amendments to the credit agreement  if we were unable to obtain such
waivers or amendments  the banks would have the right to accelerate the payment
of our  outstanding  obligations  under the credit  agreement which would have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and viability as an operating
company an event of default under any debt instrument  if not cured or waived
could have a material adverse effect on us

we face risks in investing in and integrating new acquisitions

acquisitions of companies  divisions of companies  or products entail numerous
risks including

o    potential  inability to  successfully  integrate  acquired  operations  and
     products or to realize  cost  savings or other  anticipated  benefits  from
     integration
o    diversion of managements attention
o    loss of key employees of acquired operations
o    the  difficulty of  assimilating  geographically  dispersed  operations and
     personnel of the acquired companies
o    the potential disruption of our ongoing business
o    unanticipated expenses related to such integration

page

o    the correct assessment of the relative  percentages of inprocess  research
     and development  expense that can be immediately written off as compared to
     the amount which must be amortized over the appropriate life of the asset
o    the impairment of  relationships  with employees and customers of either an
     acquired company or our own business
o    the potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired business and
o    inability to recover strategic investments in development stage entities

as a result  of such  acquisitions  we have  significant  assets  that  include
goodwill and other purchased intangibles the testing of these intangibles under
established  accounting  guidelines for impairment  requires  significant use of
judgment  and  assumptions   changes  in  business   conditions  could  require
adjustments to the valuation of these assets in addition  losses incurred by a
company in which we have an investment may have a direct impact on our financial
statements  or could  result  in our  having  to  writedown  the  value of such
investment  any such problems in integration or adjustments to the value of the
assets  acquired  could harm our  growth  strategy  and have a material  adverse
effect on our business financial condition and compliance with debt covenants

we face competition in our markets

our markets are highly  competitive  and we expect that both direct and indirect
competition  will  increase in the  future  our  overall  competitive  position
depends on a number of factors  including the price  quality and performance of
our products  the level of customer service  the development of new technology
and our ability to participate in emerging markets  within each of our markets
we encounter direct  competition from other gps optical and laser suppliers and
competition may intensify from various larger us and nonus  competitors and new
market entrants some of which may be our current customers  the competition in
the future may in some cases  result in price  reductions  reduced margins or
loss of market share  any of which could  materially  and adversely  affect our
business operating results and financial condition we believe that our ability
to  compete   successfully  in  the  future  against   existing  and  additional
competitors  will  depend  largely on our  ability to execute  our  strategy  to
provide systems and products with significantly differentiated features compared
to currently available  products  we may not be able to implement this strategy
successfully and our products may not be competitive with other technologies or
products  that  may  be  developed  by  our  competitors   many  of  whom  have
significantly greater financial technical manufacturing  marketing sales and
other resources than we do

we are dependent on proprietary technology

our future success and  competitive  position is dependent upon our  proprietary
technology  and we rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright law to
protect our  intellectual  property  the patents owned or licensed by us may be
invalidated  circumvented  and  challenged  the rights  granted  under  these
patents  may not  provide  competitive  advantages  to us any of our pending or
future  patent  applications  may not be issued  within  the scope of the claims
sought by us if at all

others may develop  technologies that are similar or superior to our technology
duplicate our  technology or design around the patents owned by us in addition
effective  copyright  patent and trade secret  protection  may be  unavailable
limited  or not  applied  for in  certain  countries  the steps  taken by us to
protect  our  technology  might  not  prevent  the   misappropriation   of  such
technology

the value of our products relies  substantially  on our technical  innovation in
fields in which there are many current patent filings  we recognize that as new
patents  are  issued or are  brought  to our  attention  by the  holders of such
patents it may be necessary for us to withdraw products from the market take a
license from such patent  holders  or redesign our products  we do not believe
any of our products  currently  infringe patents or other proprietary  rights of
third  parties  but we cannot be certain  they do not do so in  addition  the
legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard  intellectual property or
to defend against  litigation could become a significant  expense of operations
such  events  could  have  a  material   adverse   effect  on  our  revenues  or
profitability

we must carefully manage our future growth

growth in our sales or continued  expansion in the scope of our operations could
strain our current management financial manufacturing and other resources and
may require us to implement  and improve a variety of  operating  financial and
other systems procedures and controls specifically we have experienced strain

page

in our  financial  and order  management  system  we are  expanding  our sales
accounting   manufacturing   and  other  information  systems  to  meet  these
challenges  problems  associated  with any  improvement  or  expansion of these
systems  procedures or controls may adversely  affect our  operations and these
systems procedures or controls may not be designed  implemented or improved in
a costeffective and timely manner any failure to implement improve and expand
such systems  procedures  and controls in a timely and efficient  manner could
harm our growth  strategy  and  adversely  affect our  financial  condition  and
ability to achieve our business objectives

we are dependent on retaining and  attracting  highly  skilled  development  and
managerial personnel

our ability to maintain our competitive technological position will depend in a
large part on our ability to attract  motivate  and retain  highly  qualified
development and managerial personnel competition for qualified employees in our
industry and locations is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be
able to attract  motivate  and retain enough qualified employees necessary for
the future continued development of our business and products

we may encounter problems associated with international operations and sales

our customers are located throughout the world sales to unaffiliated  customers
in nonus locations represented  approximately 50 of our revenues in our fiscal
year 2004  51 of our  revenues in our fiscal year 2003  and 49 in our fiscal
year  2002  respectively   in  addition  we  have  significant  international
operations including a joint venture manufacturing facilities sales personnel
and  customer  support  operations  we have sales  offices  outside the us our
nonus manufacturing  facilities are in sweden canada france and germany and
we have a regional  fulfillment  center in the netherlands  our nonus presence
exposes us to risks not faced by wholly us companies

specifically  we have  experienced  issues  relating to  integration  of nonus
operations greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection longer payment
cycles and currency  fluctuations  additionally  we face the following risks
among others

o    unexpected changes in regulatory requirements
o    tariffs and other trade barriers
o    political  legal and economic instability in nonus markets  particularly
     in  those  markets  in  which  we  maintain   manufacturing   and  research
     facilities
o    difficulties in staffing and management
o    language and cultural barriers
o    seasonal  reductions in business  activities in the summer months in europe
     and some other countries o war and acts of terrorism and
o    potentially adverse tax consequences

in certain nonus markets there may be reluctance to purchase products based on
gps technology given the control of gps by the us government

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates

a significant  portion of our business is conducted  outside the united  states
and as such we face exposure to movements in nonus  currency  exchange  rates
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have
a material  adverse  impact on our financial  results and cash flows  in fiscal
2004  the us dollar  continued to weaken  against  several major  currencies in
which we do business  adversely impacting our financial results  the weaker us
dollar negatively impacts our operating income due to significant manufacturing
distribution research and development and selling expenses incurred outside of
the us while the weaker us dollar positively  impacts our revenues generated in
foreign currencies primarily the euro

currently we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets
and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies the hedging activities
undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency  fluctuations  on
certain  nonfunctional  currency assets and liabilities  our attempts to hedge
against these risks may not be successful  resulting in an adverse impact on our
net income


page


we are subject to the impact of governmental and other similar certifications

we  market  certain  products  that are  subject  to  governmental  and  similar
certifications  before  they can be sold  for  example  ce  certification  for
radiated  emissions is required  for most gps  receiver and data  communications
products sold in the european union an inability to obtain such  certifications
in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our operating results  also
some of our products that use integrated radio communication  technology require
an end user to obtain licensing from the federal communications commission fcc
for  frequencyband  usage  these are  secondary  licenses  that are subject to
certain  restrictions  during the fourth quarter of 1998  the fcc  temporarily
suspended  the  issuance of  licenses  for  certain of our  realtime  kinematic
products  because of  interference  with  certain  other users of similar  radio
frequencies  an inability or delay in obtaining such  certifications or changes
to the rules by the fcc could adversely affect our ability to bring our products
to market  which  could  harm our  customer  relationships  and have a  material
adverse effect on our business

the volatility of our stock price could adversely  affect your investment in our
common stock

the market  price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  highly
volatile  during fiscal 2004 our stock price ranged from 2015 to 3445  we
believe  that a variety of factors  could cause the price of our common stock to
fluctuate perhaps substantially including

o    announcements  and rumors of  developments  related to our  business or the
     industry in which we compete
o    quarterly  fluctuations in our actual or anticipated  operating results and
     order levels
o    general  conditions in the worldwide  economy  including  fluctuations  in
     interest rates
o    announcements of technological innovations
o    new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors
o    developments  in  patents  or  other   intellectual   property  rights  and
     litigation
o    developments in our relationships with our customers and suppliers and
o    any significant acts of terrorism against the united states

in  addition  in recent  years the stock  market in general and the markets for
shares of hightech  companies in particular  have experienced  extreme price
fluctuations  which have often been  unrelated to the operating  performance  of
affected  companies  any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect
the market price of our common  stock  and the market price of our common stock
may decline

we may be materially affected by new regulatory requirements

we face increasing  complexity in our product design and procurement  operations
as we  adjust  to new  and  upcoming  requirements  relating  to  the  materials
composition  of many of our products  the european union eu has adopted two
directives to facilitate the recycling of electrical  and  electronic  equipment
sold in the eu  the  first of  these is the  waste  electrical  and  electronic
equipment  weee  directive  which  directs  eu member  states to enact  laws
regulations   and  administrative   provisions  to  ensure  that  producers  of
electrical and electronic  equipment are  financially  responsible for specified
collection  recycling treatment and environmentally sound disposal of products
placed on the market  after  august 13  2005 and from  products in use prior to
that date that are being  replaced  the eu has also adopted the  restriction on
the use of certain hazardous  substances in electrical and electronic  equipment
rohs  directive  the rohs directive  restricts the use of lead mercury and
certain other  substances in electrical  and electronic  products  placed on the
market in the european union after july 1 2006

similar  laws and  regulations  have been or may be  enacted  in other  regions
including in the united states china and japan other environmental regulations
may require us to reengineer our products to utilize  components  which are more
environmentally compatible and such reengineering and component substitution may
result in additional  costs to us  although we do not  anticipate  any material
adverse  effects  based on the nature of our  operations  and the effect of such
laws there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have
a material adverse effect on our business

we are subject to  environmental  laws and potential  exposure to  environmental
liabilities

we are  subject  to  various  federal  state and local  environmental  laws and
regulations  that govern our operations  including the handling and disposal of
nonhazardous  and  hazardous  wastes  and emissions  and  discharges  into the

page

environment  failure to comply with such laws and  regulations  could result in
costs for corrective action  penalties or the imposition of other liabilities
we also are subject to laws and regulations  that impose  liability and cleanup
responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment  under
certain of these laws and  regulations  a current or previous owner or operator
of property may be liable for the costs of remediating  hazardous  substances or
petroleum products on or from its property  without regard to whether the owner
or operator knew of or caused the contamination as well as incur liability to
third  parties  impacted by such  contamination  the presence of or failure to
remediate  properly  such substances  could adversely  affect the value and the
ability to transfer or encumber  such  property  based on  currently  available
information   although  there  can  be  no  assurance  we  believe  that  such
liabilities will not have a material impact on our business

provisions in our charter  documents and under  california  law could prevent or
delay a change of  control  which could  reduce the market  price of our common
stock

certain  provisions of our articles of  incorporation  as amended and restated
our bylaws as amended and restated  and the california general corporation law
may be deemed to have an antitakeover effect and could discourage a third party
from acquiring or make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  control
of us without  approval of our board of directors  these  provisions could also
limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for
shares of our common stock  certain  provisions allow the board of directors to
authorize the issuance of preferred  stock with rights  superior to those of the
common stock

we have adopted a preferred shares rights agreement commonly known as a poison
pill the  provisions  described  above  our poison pill and provisions of the
california  general  corporation  law may  discourage  delay or prevent a third
party from acquiring us

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk

we are exposed to market risk  related to changes in interest  rates and foreign
currency  exchange rates  we use certain  derivative  financial  instruments to
manage  these  risks  we  do  not  use  derivative  financial  instruments  for
speculative  or  trading  purposes   all  financial  instruments  are  used  in
accordance with policies approved by our board of directors

market interest rate risk

we are exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing  interest rates
under our  secured  credit  facility  our credit  facility  is  comprised  of a
threeyear  us  dollaronly  revolver  that  expires  on june 25  2006  and a
fouryear term loan that expires on june 25 2007  borrowings  under the credit
facility have interest  payments based on a floating rate of libor plus a number
of basis  points tied to a formula  based on our  leverage  ratio  the revolver
matures on june 25 2006 and has an outstanding principal balance of 7 million
while the term loan  matures on june 25 2007 and has an  outstanding  principal
balance of 3125  million  as of december 31 2004 all in us currency  only
the  threemonth  libor  effective  rate at  december  31  2004  was  256  a
hypothetical   10  increase  in   threemonth   libor  rates  could  result  in
approximately  98000  annual  increase  in  interest  expense on the  existing
principal balances we have hedged the market risk with an interest rate swap on
50 of our term loan the rate on that interest rate swap is 2517

 the  hypothetical  changes and  assumptions  made above will be different from
what  actually  occurs  in the  future  furthermore  the  computations  do not
anticipate  actions that may be taken by our management  should the hypothetical
market changes actually occur over time as a result actual earnings effects in
the future will differ from those quantified above

foreign currency exchange rate risk

we enter into foreign  exchange  forward  contracts  to minimize the  shortterm
impact of  foreign  currency  fluctuations  on certain  trade and  intercompany
receivables and payables  primarily  denominated in australian  canadian  new
zealand  and  swedish  currencies  the  euro  and the  british  pound  these
contracts  reduce the exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements as the
gains and losses  associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset
with the gains and losses on the forward contracts these instruments are marked
to market through  earnings  every period and generally  range from one to three
months in  original  maturity  we do not enter into  foreign  exchange  forward
contract for trading purposes

foreign  exchange  forward  contracts  outstanding  as of december  31 2004 and
january 2 2004 are summarized as follows in thousands

item 1   business overview

trimble navigation limited a california corporation trimble or the company
or we or our or us  provides advanced  positioning  product solutions to
commercial  and  government  users in a large number of markets  these  markets
include surveying  construction  agriculture  urban and resource  management
military transportation and telecommunications our products typically provide
benefits  that  can  include  cost   savings   improved   quality   or  higher
productivity  examples of our products include  earthmoving  equipment guidance
systems  surveying  instruments  fleet management  systems  components for in
vehicle  navigation and telematics  systems  farm equipment  guidance  systems
field data collection handhelds  and timing modules used in the synchronization
of wireless networks

our products typically  integrate  positioning  communication  and information
technologies  positioning  technologies  used  include  the global  positioning
system gps  laser  optical  and inertial  while  communication  techniques
include both public  networks  such as cellular  and private  networks such as
business band radio a significant amount of the differentiation in the products
is provided  through  software  both  firmware  that  enables  the  positioning
solution and  applications  software that allows the customer to make use of the
positioning information

we design and market our own products  our  manufacturing  strategy  includes a
combination of in house assembly and fabrication as well as subcontracting those
functions  to third  parties  we  conduct  our  business  globally  with  major
development manufacturing or logistics operations in the united states sweden
germany  new zealand  and the netherlands  products are sold through dealers
representatives  joint ventures and other channels throughout the world these
channels are supported by our sales offices located in more than 20 countries

we began  operations in 1978 and  incorporated in california in 1981 our common
stock has been publicly traded on nasdaq since 1990 under the symbol trmb

technology overview

a  majority  of our  revenues  is  derived  from  applying  gps  to  terrestrial
applications  gps is a system of 24 orbiting  satellites and associated  ground
control that is funded and  maintained by the u s  government and is available
worldwide free of charge gps positioning is based on a technique that precisely
measures  distances from four or more  satellites  the satellites  continuously
transmit precisely timed radio signals using extremely accurate atomic clocks a
gps receiver  measures  distances from the satellites in view by determining the
travel time of a signal from the satellite to the receiver  and then uses those
distances to compute its position under normal circumstances a standalone gps
receiver is able to calculate its position at any point on earth in the earths
atmosphere or in lower earth orbit to approximately 10 meters 24 hours a day
much better  accuracies are possible  through a technique  called  differential
gps in addition gps provides extremely accurate time measurement

gps accuracy is dependent  upon the  locations of the receiver and the number of
gps  satellites  that are above the horizon at any given time  reception of gps
signals  requires  lineofsight  visibility  between  the  satellites  and  the
receiver  which can be blocked by  buildings  hills  and dense  foliage  the
receiver must have a line of sight to at least four  satellites to determine its
latitude longitude  attitude angular orientation  and time the accuracy of
gps may also be limited by distortion of gps signals from  ionospheric and other
atmospheric conditions

our gps products are based on proprietary receiver  technology  the convergence
of positioning  wireless and information  technologies enables significant new
value  to be  added to  positioning  systems  thereby  creating  a more  robust
solution for the user in addition  recent  developments in wireless technology
and deployments of next generation wireless networks have enabled less expensive
wireless communications  these developments allow for the efficient transfer of
position data to locations away from the positioning field device  allowing the
data to be accessed by more users and thereby increasing productivity

our laser and optical  products  measure  distances and angles  accurately using
light  we generally  use  commercially  available  laser diodes to create light
beams for distance measurement in addition our proprietary precision mechanics

page

and software  algorithms  in these  products  combine to give  robust  accurate
distance and angle  measurements for a variety of agricultural  surveying  and
construction applications


business strategy


our  business  strategy  leverages  our  expertise  in  positioning  to  provide
solutions for our customers built around several key elements

o  attractive  markets  we focus on markets  that offer  potential  for revenue
growth profitability and market leadership

o innovative  solutions that provide significant  benefits to our customers  we
seek to apply our technology to applications  for which position data has a high
value  we  anticipate  that  further  advances in  positioning  wireless  and
information  technologies  will enable new classes of  solutions  to emerge that
will create new opportunities

o  distribution  channels  to best  access  our  markets  we utilize a range of
distribution  channels  to best  serve the needs of  individual  markets  these
channels  can  include  independent  dealers   direct  sales  oem  sales  and
distribution  alliances  with key  partners  in addition  we will  continue to
extend our international distribution

business segments and markets

we are organized  into four main  operating  segments  encompassing  our various
applications and product lines  engineering and construction  field solutions
component  technologies  and  mobile  solutions  we also  operate  in  smaller
business  areas   primarily  focused  on  military  and  inertial   integration
technologies  which  aggregate  into the portfolio  technologies  segment  our
segments are  distinguished by the markets they serve  each segment consists of
businesses  which are responsible  for product  development  marketing  sales
strategy and financial performance and is headed by a general manager

segment realignment

in the  first  fiscal  quarter  of  2003  we  realigned  two of our  reportable
segments  the  tripod  data  systems  tds  business  is now  included  in the
engineering  and  construction  segment  previously  it  was  included  in  the
portfolio  technologies segment all comparable  information for earlier periods
has been restated to conform to the new basis

engineering and construction

products in the engineering and  construction  segment improve  productivity and
accuracy  throughout  the entire  construction  process  including  the  initial
survey planning design earthmoving and building phases the product emphasis
is aimed at making each individual  task more efficient  as well as speeding up
the entire process by improving information flow from one step to the next

we  typically  combine a number of  technologies  into  product  solutions  the
elements of these  solutions  may  incorporate  gps  optical  laser  radio or
cellular communications and software

an example  of the  customer  benefits  provided  by our  product is our gps and
robotic  optical  surveying  instruments  which  enable the  surveyor to perform
operations  in  the  field  faster  more  reliably  and  with a  smaller  crew
similarly  our  construction  machine  guidance  products allow the operator to
achieve the desired  landform by eliminating  stakeout and reducing  rework  in
turn  these steps in the  construction  process can be readily linked  together
with data  collection  modules  and  software  to  minimize  the time and effort
required to maintain data accuracy throughout the entire construction process

we sell and distribute  our products from this segment  through a global network
of  independent  dealers that are supported by our sales force  this channel is
supplemented by relationships  that create additional  channel breadth including
our joint ventures with  caterpillar  nikon and private branding  arrangements
with other companies

page

we also design and market handheld data collectors and data collection  software
for field use by surveyors contractors and other professionals these products
are sold directly through dealers and other survey manufacturers  competitors
in this portion of the business are small and geographically diverse

competitors in this segment are typically companies that provide optical laser
or gps positioning  products  our principal  competitors are topcon corporation
and leica  geosystems  price points in this segment range from less than 1000
for  certain  laser  systems to  approximately  125000  for a high  precision
threedimensional machine control system

cnh  global  competitors  in  this  market  are  either  vertically  integrated
implement  companies  such  as  john  deere  or  agricultural   instrumentation
suppliers such as raven rhs csi wireless beeline and integrinautics

our gis  product  line is  centered  on  handheld  data  collectors  that gather
information in the field to be incorporated  into gis databases  typically this
information includes features attributes and positions of fixed infrastructure
and  natural  resource  assets  an example  would be that of a utility  company
performing a survey of its transmission poles including the age and condition of
each  telephone  pole  our handheld  unit enables this data to be collected and
automatically  stored while  confirming the location of the asset  the data can

page

then be downloaded into a gis database  this stored data could later be used to
navigate back to any  individual  asset or item for  maintenance or data update
our mobile gis initiative goes one step further by allowing this  information to
be communicated  from the field worker to the  backoffice gis database  through
the combination of wireless  technologies  bluetooth and cellular  as well as
giving the field  worker the ability to download  information  from the database
using these same wireless  technologies  this capability  provides  significant
advantages to users including improved productivity  accuracy and access to the
information in the field

distribution  for gis  products is  primarily  through a network of  independent
dealers and business partners supported by our sales force primary markets for
our  gis  products  and  solutions  include  government  defense  and  homeland
security   utility  and  communications   and  natural  resources   management
competitors  in this market are  typically  either survey  instrument  companies
having gps  technology  andor  consumer gps  companies  two examples are leica
geosystems and thales navigation

approximate  price points in this  segment  range from 3000 for a gis handheld
unit to 35000 for a fully automated farm equipment control system

representative products sold within this segment include

component technologies

our  component   technologies   segment   provides   gpsbased   components  for
applications  that require embedded position or time our largest markets are in
the  telecommunications  and  automotive  industries  where we  supply  modules
boards  custom  integrated  circuits and  software  or single  application  ip
licenses to the customer  according to the needs of the  application  sales are
made directly to original equipment  manufacturers oems and system integrators
who  incorporate  our  component  into a subsystem  or a complete  systemlevel
product

in the telecommunications  infrastructure market we provide timing modules that
keep wireless networks synchronized and on frequency for example cdma cellular
telephone  networks  require  a high  level  of both  shortterm  and  longterm
frequency stability for proper operation  synchronization of  informationvoice
flow to avoid  dropped  calls  our timing  modules  meet these needs at a much
lower cost than the atomic standards or other specially prepared components that
would otherwise be required customers include wireless infrastructure companies
such as nortel samsung nokia utstarcom and andrew

in the  automotive  and  embedded  market  we provide a gps  component  that is
embedded  into  invehicle   navigation   ivn  systems   our  focus  on  high

mobile solutions

our mobile solutions segment addresses the market for fleet management  services
by providing a trimblehosted  platform  solution that bundles both the hardware
and software needed to run the application  the software  solution is typically
provided to the user through  internetenabled access to our hosted platform for
a monthly  service  fee  this  bundled  solution  enables  the  fleet  owner to
dispatch  track  and  monitor  the  conditions  of  vehicles in the fleet on a
realtime basis a vehiclemounted  unit consists of a single module including a
gps receiver  sensor interface and a cellular modem our solution includes the
communication  service  from the  vehicle to our data center and access over the
internet to the application software relieving the user of the need to maintain
extensive computer operations

we market our fleet management  services in three primary areas  leveraging the
core platform  our vertical market strategy  targets  opportunities in specific
vertical  markets where we believe we can provide a unique value to the end user
by customizing the hardware and software solution for a particular industry for
example  the first vertical we are  addressing is ready mix concrete  here we
combine a suite of sensors into a solution that can automatically  determine the
status of a vehicle without driver intervention  our agreement with mcneilus a
major  manufacturer  of trucks for the ready mix concrete  and waste  management
industries  facilitates the delivery of a complete management solution to ready
mix concrete fleet operators and refuse  haulers  mcneilus sales force markets
our  solution  as  a  retrofit  for  trucks  already  in  the  field  or  as  a
factoryinstalled  option  we plan on leveraging our  technology  partners and
customers into other verticals  such as other  construction  material  delivery
vehicles and waste management  trucks  where a customized  solution can provide
similar benefits as in ready mix

we also have a horizontal  market  strategy  that  focuses on providing  turnkey
solutions to a broad range of service  fleets and mobile  workers that span over
90 distinct  markets  here we leverage the same general  applications that are
used in our vertical markets however the same level of customization  such as
additional  sensors  is typically not required  these products are distributed
through individual dealers and dealer service providers as well as aftermarket
automotive electronics suppliers

page

our enterprise strategy focuses on sales to large enterprise accounts here in
addition  to a  trimblehosted  solution  we can also  integrate  our  software
directly  into the  customers  it  infrastructure  giving them  control of the
information  in this market we sell directly to end users and sales cycles tend
to be long due to field trials followed by an extensive decisionmaking process

approximate  prices for the hardware fall in the range of 300 to 3000  while
the monthly software service fees range from  approximately 20 to approximately
55  depending on the customer  service level  competition  comes largely from
serviceoriented businesses such as road and software companies such as command
alkon

representative products sold by this division include

telvisantr system  our fleet management service offering telvisant provides
different  levels  of  service  that run from  snapshots  of fleet  activity  to
realtime  fleet dispatch  capability  telvisant  includes truck  communication
service and computer  backbone support of the software  variations of telvisant
are tailored for specific industry applications

acquisitions and joint ventures

our growth strategy is centered around  developing and marketing  innovative and
complete valueadded  solutions to our existing customers  while also marketing
them to new  customers  and  geographic  regions  to do this  we believe it is
essential  to  continually  enhance  our  market  position  which  has  led  to
partnering  with or acquiring  companies  that bring  technologies  products or
distribution  capabilities  that will  allow us to enter or  penetrate  a market
quicker than if we had done so solely  through  internal  development  over the

page

past five  years  this has led us to form two joint  ventures  and  acquire six
companies  no assurance  can be given that our previous or future  acquisitions
will be  successful  or will  not  materially  adversely  affect  our  financial
condition or operating results

company  has a 50  ownership  stake and have equal  voting  rights  this joint
venture is  developing  new  generations  of machine  control  products  for the
construction  and mining markets for  installation in the factory or as a dealer
option

 today we sell  construction  machine control products to contractors  through
our dealer channel for installation on bulldozers motorgraders and excavators
that are  already in the field the  aftermarket  however  both  companies
believe the  adoption  of the  technology  will spur  future  demand for machine
control  products  that can be  integrated  into the  design of new  caterpillar
machines while also available for aftermarket installation

patents licenses and intellectual property

we hold  approximately  600 us patents and 108 nonus  patents  the majority of
which cover gps technology and applications  and over 94 of which cover optical
and laser technology and applications

page

we prefer to own the intellectual property used in our products either directly
or though  subsidiaries  from time to time we  license  technology  from  third
parties

there are approximately 60 trademarks registered to trimble including trimble
the globe and triangle logo  aggps  geoexplorer  and  telvisant  among
others that are  registered to trimble  navigation  limited in the united states
and other countries additional trademarks are pending registration

sales and marketing

we currently  have regional sales offices  throughout  north america and europe
offices  serving the rest of the world  include  australia  china  korea  new
zealand singapore and united arab emirates we tailor the distribution channel
to the needs of our products and regional markets  therefore  we have a number
of forms of sales channel solutions around the world

north america

we sell our products in the united states and canada primarily  through dealers
distributors  and authorized representatives  this channel is supplemented and
supported by our employees who provide additional sales support  in some cases
where third  party  distribution  is not  available  we utilize a direct  sales
force we also utilize  distribution  alliances and oem relationships with other
companies as a means to serve selected markets

international

we market to end users  through an  extensive  world wide network of dealers and
distributors  distributors  carry one or more product  lines and are  generally
assigned a territory  we occasionally  grant exclusive rights to market certain
products within specified countries see note 3 of the notes to the consolidated
financial statements for financial information regarding joint ventures

sales  to   unaffiliated   customers   outside  the  united   states   comprised
approximately  51 in 2003 49 in 2002 and 50 in 2001 during the 2003 fiscal
year  north and south  america  represented  56  europe  the middle east and
africa represented 31 and asia represented 13 of our total revenues

support and warranty

the warranty periods for our products are generally  between one and three years
from date of shipment  selected military programs may require extended warranty
periods up to 55 years certain tds products have a 90day warranty period and
certain nikon  products  have a fiveyear  warranty  period  we support our gps
products  through a circuit  board  replacement  program  from  locations in the
united  kingdom   germany  japan  and  the  united  states  the  repair  and
calibration  of  our  nongps  products  are  available  from  companyowned  or
authorized facilities  we reimburse dealers and distributors for all authorized
warranty repairs they perform

while we engage in extensive  product quality programs and processes  including
actively  monitoring  and  evaluating  the quality of component  suppliers  our
warranty  obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage  and
service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product  failure  should actual
product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from the
estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty accrual and related costs may be
required

seasonality of business

 our  revenues  are  affected  by  seasonal  buying  patterns  in  some  of our
businesses  over half of our  total  revenue  comes  from our  engineering  and
construction  business  which  has the  biggest  seasonal  impact  on our total
revenue this business and therefore our total revenue is seasonally strongest
during the second quarter due to the start of the construction  buying season in
the northern  hemisphere  in spring  typically  we expect the first and fourth
quarters  to be the  seasonal  lows due to the lack of  construction  during the

page

winter months if other factors such as economic conditions or underlying growth
in the business are removed  the historical  variability in our total quarterly
revenue from seasonality has generally been less than 10 percent

backlog

in most of our markets  the time between order placement and shipment is short
therefore  we believe  that  backlog is not a reliable  indicator of present or
future business conditions

we believe that our competitive  position is maintained  through the development
and  introduction of new products that  incorporate  improved  features  better
performance  smaller size and weight  lower cost or some combination of these
factors  we invest  substantially  in the development of new products  we also
make significant investment in the positioning  communication  and information

item 7 managements  discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
of operations

the following  discussion  should be read in conjunction  with the  consolidated
financial  statements and the related notes the following  discussion  contains
forwardlooking  statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs  our
actual   results   could  differ   materially   from  those   discussed  in  the
forwardlooking  statements  factors  that could cause or  contribute  to these
differences  include  but are not limited to those  discussed  below and those
listed under risks and uncertainties


executive level overview

we are a global  provider  of  complete  integrated  solutions  that  provide a
seamless  flow of position  information  both in the field and between the field
and back  office  to do this  we  utilize  advanced  positioning  technologies
including gps optical inertial and laser technologies combined with wireless
communications  and  applications  software  to get data points with accuracies
down to several  millimeters  this can increase  productivity  through time and
cost  savings  as the need for labor is reduced  rework from  mistakes is less
frequent and the time to complete a job is shortened

page

our solutions  businesses  engineering and construction  field solutions  and
mobile  solutions  make up over 80 of our  revenue  we believe our strength in
these  businesses  stems  from our  ability  to  bring  innovative  products  or
solutions  to the  market  as well as  effectively  train and  manage a global
thirdparty  distribution  channel  that is  proficient  in  selling  technology
solutions  into  markets  that have  historically  utilized  manual and lowtech
processes

in 2003 we  extended  our  market  and  product  capabilities  through  internal
development  acquisitions  and  alliances  in july  we  established  a joint
venture  with nikon  corporation  which will extend our  presence in the global
construction  positioning market our acquisitions of applanix in july and mensi
in december added important new technologies which will enable us to develop new
applications  or broaden  current  application  solutions  we also announced an
alliance with cnh global which will significantly extend our distribution reach
for our autopilot agricultural product line

our other  strategic  business  component  technologies  is different from the
solution businesses  as it seeks to either provide gps technology directly to
third parties  such as oems and system  integrators  or to integrate gps into
other  technologies   such  as  wireless   these  products  allow  for  higher
functionality  and therefore  a higher average selling price for our offerings
through greater  integration we see potential future growth  opportunities  for
example our recently announced trimtrac product integrates gps and gsm cellular
technologies into a fully functional location device it establishes a new asset
tracking or security  capability at an aggressive price point and opens up a new
class of customers and applications which were previously not available to us

in 2003 we  positioned  ourselves in newer  markets that will serve as important
sources of future growth our efforts in china india russia korea and eastern
europe all reflected  improving  financial results  with the promise of more in
the future

with our improving  profitability  we now have the  opportunity to reemphasize
revenue growth  we expect this growth to come from the  continuation of several
trends that we saw in 2003  these trends include further  penetrating  existing
markets with  current and new  products  continued  geographic  expansion  into
emerging markets such as russia  china india korea and eastern europe taking
advantage  of  market  consolidation  improving  competitive  position  due  to
offering complete  solutions with a proficient dealer channel  and entering new
markets with new products such as our trimtrac tm locator and recon  products
fleet  management  services  and our  inertialgps  positioning and orientation
systems acquired as part of applanix

critical accounting policies and estimates

our accounting  policies are more fully  described in note 1 of the notes to the
consolidated  financial statements  the preparation of financial statements and
related disclosures in conformity with accounting  principles generally accepted
in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates
that affect the amounts  reported in the consolidated  financial  statements and
accompanying  notes to the consolidated  financial  statements  we consider the
accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting polices  these
critical   accounting   policies  are  impacted   significantly   by  judgments
assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported
based on these policies

revenue recognition

we recognize product revenue when persuasive  evidence of an arrangement exists
delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is
reasonably  assured  in  instances  where  final  acceptance  of the product is
specified  by the  customer  or is  uncertain  revenue  is  deferred  until all
acceptance  criteria have been met our total deferred  revenue was 77 million
and 60  million  as of january  2 2004 and  january  3  2003  respectively
revenue is reduced by a sales return reserve as described  under  allowance for
doubtful accounts and sales returns

revenue from purchased  extended warranty and support agreements is deferred and
recognized ratably over the term of the warrantysupport  period  substantially
all technology  licenses and research  revenue have consisted of initial license
fees and  royalties  which were  recognized  when  earned  provided  we had no
remaining obligations

page

contracts  and customer  purchase  orders are  generally  used to determine  the
existence of an arrangement  shipping documents and customer  acceptance  when
applicable  are used to verify delivery  we assess whether the fee is fixed or
determinable  based on the payment terms  associated  with the  transaction  and
whether  the  sales  price  is  subject  to  refund  or  adjustment  we  assess
collectibility  based  primarily  on the  creditworthiness  of the  customer  as
determined  by credit  checks and analysis  as well as the  customers  payment
history

our shipment terms for us orders  and  international  orders fulfilled from our
european  distribution  center are typically fca free carrier  shipping point
except   certain  sales  to  us  government   agencies  which  are  shipped  fob
destination  fca shipping point means that we fulfill the obligation to deliver
when the goods are handed over  cleared for export  and into the charge of the
carrier  named by the buyer at the named place or point  if no precise point is
indicated by the buyer we may choose within the place or range stipulated where
the carrier will take the goods into carriers charge

other  international  orders are  shipped  fob  destination  which  means these
international  orders  are not  recognized  as  revenue  until  the  product  is
delivered  and title has  transferred  to the buyer or fca shipping  point  fob
destination  means  that we bear all  costs  and  risks of loss or damage to the
goods up to that point 

revenue to distributors and resellers is recognized upon delivery  assuming all
other criteria for revenue recognition have been met distributors and resellers
do not have a right of return

when a sale involves multiple  elements  the entire fee from the arrangement is
allocated  to each  respective  element  based on its  relative  fair  value and
recognized  when  revenue  recognition  criteria  for each  element are met the
amount of product revenue  allocated to an individual  element is limited to the
lesser of its relative  fair value or the amount not  contingent on our delivery
of other elements under the  arrangement  regardless of the  probability of our
performance

our software  arrangements  generally consist of a license fee and postcontract
customer support pcs we have established  vendorspecific  objective evidence
vsoe of fair  value  for our pcs  contracts  based on the  renewal  rate  the
remaining  value of the  software  arrangement  is  allocated to the license fee
using the residual method and revenue is primarily recognized when the software
has been delivered and there are no remaining  obligations  revenue from pcs is
recognized ratably over the term of the pcs agreement

allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns

our accounts  receivable  balance  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  was
962  million as of january 2 2004  compared with 776 million as of january
3 2003  the  allowance  for doubtful  accounts as of january 2 2004 was 100
million  compared  with 99  million as of january 3 2003  we  evaluate  the
collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors in
circumstances where we are aware of a specific customers  inability to meet its
financial obligations to us a specific allowance for bad debts is estimated and
recorded  which reduces the  recognized  receivable  to the estimated  amount we
believe  will  ultimately  be  collected   in  addition  to  specific  customer
identification  of potential bad debts  bad debt charges are recorded  based on
our  recent  past  loss  history  and an  overall  assessment  of past due trade
accounts receivable amounts outstanding

a reserve for sales returns is established based on historical trends in product
return rates  experienced  in the ordinary  course of business  the reserve for
sales  returns as of january 2 2004 and january 3 2003  included  33 million
and 27 million  respectively for estimated future returns that were recorded
as a reduction of our accounts  receivable  and  revenue  if the actual  future
returns were to deviate from the  historical  data on which the reserve had been
established our revenue could be adversely affected

inventory valuation

our  inventory  balance was 708  million as of january 2 2004  compared with
611 million as of january 3 2003  our inventory  allowances as of january 2
2004 were 259 million  compared with 252 million as of january 3 2003 our
inventory  is  recorded at the lower of cost or market  we use a standard  cost
accounting  system to value inventory and these standards are reviewed a minimum
of  once a year  and  multiple  times a year in our  most  active  manufacturing
plants  we  adjust  the  inventory  value for  estimated  excess  and  obsolete

page

inventory  based on our  assessment of future demand and market  conditions  if
actual  future  demand  or  market  conditions  are less  favorable  than  those
projected by us additional inventory writedowns may be required

income taxes

deferred taxes are provided on a liability  method  whereby  deferred tax assets
are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred liabilities are
recognized for taxable  temporary  differences  temporary  differences  are the
differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax
bases  deferred  tax assets are  reduced by a  valuation  allowance  when it is
determined  to be more likely than not that some  portion or all of the deferred
tax  assets  will not be  realized  in  evaluating  the  need  for a  valuation
allowance  we consider future taxable income  resolution of tax  uncertainties
and prudent and feasible tax planning  strategies  in fiscal year 2003 we have
recorded a deferred tax asset of 76 million that is more likely than not to be
realized  we need to generate  200 million of future us income to realize the
deferred tax asset

if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred
tax assets in the future  an adjustment  to the carrying  value of the deferred
tax assets would be charged to income in the period in which such  determination
is made

our effective income tax rates from continuing operations for fiscal years 2003
2002 and 2001 were 8  25 and 9  respectively  the 2002 and 2001 income
tax rates differ from the us federal  statutory  rate of 35  due  primarily to
nonus taxes and the inability to realize the benefit of net  operating  losses
the  2003  income  tax rate is less  than the us  federal  statutory  rate  due
primarily to the  realization  of benefits from net  operating  losses and other
previously reserved deferred tax assets

goodwill impairment

goodwill as of january 2 2004 was 2414 million  compared with 2059 million
as of january 3 2003 we perform  goodwill  impairment tests on an annual basis
for each  reporting  unit  based on impairment  tests  performed  there was no
impairment of our goodwill in fiscal 2003 and 2002

for  goodwill  the annual  impairment  evaluation  includes a comparison of the
carrying  value of the reporting  unit  including  goodwill to that  reporting
units fair value  if the  reporting  units  estimated  fair value exceeds the
reporting units carrying value no impairment of goodwill  exists  if the fair
value of the reporting unit does not exceed the units carrying  value  then an
additional  analysis is performed  to allocate  the fair value of the  reporting
unit to all of the assets and  liabilities of that unit as if that unit had been
acquired  in a  business  combination  and the  fair  value  of the unit was the
purchase  price  if the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the
fair value of the identifiable  assets and liabilities is less than the carrying
value  of the  units  goodwill  an  impairment  charge  is  recorded  for  the
difference

we cannot predict the  occurrence of certain future events that might  adversely
affect the reported value of goodwill  such events include but are not limited
to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions
the impact of the  economic  environment  on our  customer  base  or a material
negative change in our relationships with significant customers

accounting  for  the  longlived   assets  including   intangibles   subject  to
amortization

depreciation  and  amortization  of our  longlived  assets  is  provided  using
straightline   methods  over  their   estimated   useful   lives   changes  in
circumstances  such as the  passage  of new  laws  or  changes  in  regulations
technological advances changes to our business model or changes in the capital
strategy  could  result  in the  actual  useful  lives  differing  from  initial
estimates  in  those  cases  where  we  determine  that  the  useful  life of a
longlived  asset should be revised  we will  depreciate  the net book value in
excess of the estimated  residual value over its revised  remaining useful life
factors  such as changes in the planned use of  equipment  customer  attrition
contractual  amendments  or mandated  regulatory  requirements  could result in
shortened useful lives

longlived assets and asset groups are evaluated for impairment  whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may
not be recoverable  the estimated future cash flows are based upon among other

page

things  assumptions about expected future operating  performance and may differ
from actual cash flows  longlived  assets evaluated for impairment are grouped
with other  assets to the  lowest  level for which  identifiable  cash flows are
largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities
if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less
than the  carrying  value of the assets  the assets will be written down to the
estimated fair value in the period in which the determination is made

warranty costs

the  liability  for product  warranties  was 51 million as of january 2 2004
compared  with 64  million as of january 3 2003  see note 1 of the notes to
the  consolidated  financial  statements for further  information  regarding our
warranty liability the warranty periods for our products are generally between
one and three  years  from date of  shipment  selected  military  programs  may
require extended  warranty periods up to 55 years  certain tds products have a
five year or 90day warranty period and certain nikon products have a five year
warranty period we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based
on associated material costs and technical support labor costs material cost is
primarily  estimated  based  upon  historical  trends in the  volume of  product
returns  within  the  warranty  period  and the cost to  repair or  replace  the
equipment

while we engage in extensive  product quality programs and processes  including
actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component  suppliers  our
warranty  obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage  and
service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product  failure  should actual
product failure rates material usage or service delivery costs differ from our
estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty accrual and related costs may be
required

stock compensation

we apply  accounting  principles  board  opinion no 25  accounting  for stock
issued to employees apb 25 and related  interpretations in accounting for our
stock option plans and stock  purchase  plan  accordingly  we do not recognize
compensation  cost for stock  options  granted at a price  equal to fair  market
value note 13 of the notes to the consolidated  financial  statements describes
the  plans we  operate  and note 1 of the notes to the  consolidated  financial
statements  contains a summary of the pro forma  effects to reported  net income
loss and earnings  loss per share for fiscal 2003  2002  and 2001 as if we
had  elected  to  recognize  compensation  cost  based on the fair  value of the
options granted at grant date

investment in joint ventures

we have  adopted the equity  method of  accounting  for our  investments  in the
caterpillar and nikon joint ventures  this requires that we record our share of
the joint  ventures  profits or losses in a given fiscal period  see note 3 of
the notes to the consolidated financial statements for joint venture accounting

upon the formation of our caterpillar joint venture in april 2002 we received a
cash  distribution  of  110  million  we  have  elected  to  treat  the  cash
distribution  as a deferred gain  being amortized to the extent that losses are
attributable  from  the  caterpillar  joint  venture  under  the  equity  method
described  above  when and if the joint  venture is profitable on a sustainable
basis and future operating losses are not anticipated then we will recognize as
a gain the portion of the 110 million  which is  unamortized  to the extent
that it is possible that we will have any futurefunding  obligation relating to
the  caterpillar  joint venture  then the relevant  amount of the 110 million
will be deferred  until such time that the funding  obligation no longer exists
as of january 2 2004  the balance of the  unamortized  deferred  gain was 98
million

basis of presentation

we have a 5253 week fiscal year  ending on the friday  nearest to december 31
which for fiscal  2003 was january 2 2004  fiscal 2003 was a 52week  year and
fiscal  2002 a  53week  year  as a result of the  extra  week in fiscal  2002
yearoveryear  results are not exactly  comparable  thus  due to the inherent
nature  of  adopting  a  5253  week  fiscal  year   the   company   analysts
shareholders investors and others will have to make appropriate adjustments to
any analysis performed when comparing our activities and results in fiscal years
that contain 53 weeks to those that  contain the standard 52 weeks  fiscal year
2001 comprised 52 weeks

impact of weaker us dollar on operating income in fiscal 2003

the  depreciation of the us dollar versus major european  currencies  positively
impacted  revenues by  approximately  153 million in fiscal 2003 compared with
fiscal  2002  as a  result  of  our  significant  manufacturing  distribution
research and development  and selling expenses  incurred outside of the us the
weaker us dollar negatively  impacted our operating income by approximately 59
million in fiscal 2003

revenue

in fiscal 2003  total  revenue  increased  by 743  million or 159 to 5409
million  from 4666  million in fiscal  2002  the  increase in fiscal 2003 was
primarily due to stronger  performances in all of our operating  segments driven
by the new  product  offerings  increased  acceptance  of our  products  in the
markets we serve expanded distribution and selective acquisitions  as well the
positive  impact  of the  weaker  us dollar on  revenues  generated  in  foreign
currencies  primarily the euro  total revenue in fiscal 2002 decreased by 87
million or 18 to 4666 million from 4753 million in fiscal 2001  primarily
due to the reduction of revenue in mobile  solutions and portfolio  technologies
segments

international revenues

 total revenue outside the united states comprised  approximately  51 in 2003
49 in 2002  and 50 in 2001  during  the 2003  fiscal  year  north and south
america represented 56 europe the middle east and africa represented 31 and
asia  represented  13 of total  revenues  in fiscal  2003  the united  states
comprised  approximately  49 of total  revenues  we  anticipate  that sales to
international  customers  will continue to account for a significant  portion of
our  revenue  for this  reason  we are subject to the risks  inherent in these
foreign sales including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements exchange
rates  governmental  approval  tariffs or other barriers  even though the us
government  announced on march 29 1996  that it supports and maintains the gps
system  and on may 1 2000  stated that it has no intent to restore  selective
availability  a method of degrading  gps  accuracy  there may be reluctance in
certain nonus markets to purchase such products given the control of gps by the
us government  our results of operations could be adversely affected if we were
unable to continue to generate significant sales in locations outside the us

 no single  customer  accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues in fiscal
2003  2002  and 2001  it is  possible  however  that in future  periods the
failure  of one or more large  customers  to  purchase  products  in  quantities
anticipated by us may adversely affect the results of operations

gross margin

our gross  margin  varies  due to a number of  factors  including  product  mix
international  sales mix  customer type the effects of production  volumes and
fixed manufacturing costs on unit product costs new product startup costs and
foreign  currency  translations  gross margin as a percentage of total revenues
was 496  in fiscal 2003 and 502 in fiscal 2002 the slight decrease in gross
margin percentage for fiscal 2003  compared with fiscal 2002 was due primarily
to the introduction of the nikon products in the third quarter which generated a
lower consolidated gross margin of approximately 08 this was partially offset
by stronger sales of tds gis wireless infrastructure  survey products as well
as our ongoing focus on product cost reductions shipping and handling costs are
included in cost of goods sold

page

gross  margin as a  percentage  of total  revenues  was 502 in fiscal 2002 and
499 in fiscal 2001 the slight increase in gross margin  percentage for fiscal
2002  compared with fiscal 2001 was due in part to approximately  33 million
of additional  charges  associated with the write down of obsolete  inventory in
fiscal 2001 related to the  rationalization  and simplification of product lines
and inventories in excess of our forecasted 12month demand

 because  of  potential  product  mix  changes  within  and among the  industry
markets  market  pressures  on  unit  selling  prices   fluctuations  in  unit
manufacturing costs  including increases in component prices and other factors
current level gross margins  cannot be assured  in addition  should the global
economic  conditions  deteriorate  gross  margin  could  be  further  adversely
impacted

engineering and construction

engineering and construction  revenues increased by 474 million or 148 while
segment  operating  income increased by 72 million or 135 for fiscal 2003 as
compared to fiscal 2002  approximately  half of the revenue increase was driven
by new product  introductions and our increased marketing efforts the remaining
increase was split evenly between geographic  expansion  especially in asia and
russia  and the  impact  of the  weaker us  dollar  segment  operating  income
increased  due to higher  revenues  that  were  partially  offset  by  increased
operating  expenses  outside the united states  largely driven by the weaker us
dollar  increased research and development  spending on certain programs as we
continue to invest in developing  next  generation  technology and lower margins
earned on the sale of nikon products overall segment operating income remained
consistent at 17 of revenues

engineering and construction  revenues  increased by 18 million or 06 during
fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 primarily due to the levelite acquisition
which added 36  million of  revenues  and strong  performance  by our machine
control  product  offering as we  continue to  penetrate  the  aftermarket  for
machine  guidance on earthmoving  equipment  increased  revenues were partially
offset by a  reduction  in revenues in several  product  areas due to  continued
difficult global economic conditions segment operating income increased by 36
million or 72 in fiscal 2002 over fiscal 2001  primarily due to a reduction of
42  million of  operating  expenses  due to the  transfer of  employeerelated
expenses to caterpillar trimble control technologies  higher revenues and lower
operating  expenses  were  partially  offset by a reduction in gross margin as a
result of product sales mix during fiscal 2002

field solutions

field solutions revenues increased by approximately 126 million or 188 while
segment operating income increased by 48 million or 499 for fiscal year 2003
as compared to fiscal  2002  revenues  were up year over year due to  continued
strong sales of the  geoexplorerr  ce series handhelds  released at the end of
fiscal 2002  and due to the expansion of our automatic  guidance  products onto
new agricultural vehicles

segment  operating  income increased in 2003 from the fiscal year 2002 primarily
due to higher revenues this increase was partially offset by fractionally lower
gross  margins  and more  investment  in  research  and  development  and  sales
functions this enabled the segment operating income to increase from 14 to 18
of revenues

field solutions  experienced a revenue decline in fiscal 2002 of 13 million or
18 compared with fiscal 2001 primarily due to the decline in the united states
federal  state and local government spending and a delay in the release of the
new  geoexplorerr ce series due to component supply issues  this decrease was
partially  offset by the increased  demand for both the manual and auto guidance
product lines  segment  operating  income decreased by 17 million or 147 in
fiscal  2002 over  fiscal  2001  primarily  due to the  decrease  in  government
spending  described above and lower gross margin due to product sales mix which
was more weighted toward the relatively lower margin agricultural business area

mobile solutions

mobile solutions  revenues  increased by 45 million or 53 in fiscal 2003 over
fiscal 2002 due  primarily to an increase in our  crosscheck  product  sales and
higher fleet management  services  revenues as a result of an expanded  customer
base  segment  operating loss decreased by 56 million or 464 in fiscal 2003
over  fiscal  2002 due to  increased  revenues  and  lower  operating  expenses
operating  expenses  decreased by approximately  30 million primarily due to a
reduction in outside services and our personnel related to the completion of our
telvisant system

page

mobile solutions revenues decreased by 53 million or 385 in fiscal 2002 over
fiscal 2001 primarily due to the reduction of approximately  30 million in our
satellite communications business as a result of our decision to discontinue the
galaxytm  inmarsatc  product  line in  early  2001  a slow  down  in  system
integration  projects  due to reduced  spending at  municipalities  and reduced
sales of wireless  products of 09  million due to a  transition  from a sensor
provider to a fully  integrated  service  provider  sales of some product lines
were down as a result of the economic slow down and the shift of technology from
analog to digital

segment  operating  loss  increased by 20 million or 205 in fiscal 2002 over
fiscal  2001  primarily  due to the  lower  revenues  as  described  above  and
increased costs incurred in the development and marketing of a service  platform
to enable a range of asset management solutions

component technologies

component technologies revenues increased by 44 million or 74 while segment
operating  income increased by 59 million or 552 for the fiscal year 2003 as
compared to fiscal 2002 the increase in revenues was primarily due to increased
demand from our existing wireless  infrastructure  customers  segment operating
income increased from 18 to 26 of revenues  the increase was primarily due to
a reduction in costs of goods sold due to the transfer of the  manufacturing  of
our products to china  reduced costs of raw materials  increased  revenues and
higher margins aided by favorable product mix

component technologies revenues increased by 17 million or 29 in fiscal 2002
over fiscal 2001 due primarily to a timing products  increase of 46 million in
fiscal 2002 over fiscal 2001 due to significant demand during the second half of
fiscal 2002 from new and existing wireless infrastructure customers ivn revenue
decreased 10 million in fiscal 2002 over fiscal 2001 as average selling prices
declined by more than 9 and license  revenue  decreased 17 million in fiscal
2002 over fiscal 2001 due to an expired license contract component technologies
operating income increased by 03 million or 3 in fiscal 2002 over fiscal 2001
as a result of higher gross margins resulting from higher revenues and favorable
product  mix  partially  offset  by higher  operating  expenses  primarily  in
research and development and marketing

portfolio technologies

portfolio  technologies  revenues  increased  by 53  million  or 462 for the
fiscal year 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 the increase in revenues was mostly
driven by the inclusion of revenue from applanix  acquired in 2003 while offset
by  lower  revenue  of  militaryrelated   products  segment  operating  income
decreased  by 22  million or 4027 for fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002
due to weaker operating results from military products

portfolio  technologies  revenues  decreased  by 56 million or 326 in fiscal
2002 over fiscal 2001 primarily due to lost revenues of 44 million as a result
of the sale of our air  transport  product  line to  honeywell  in fiscal  2001
portfolio  technologies  operating  income decreased by 02 million or 245 in
fiscal 2002 over fiscal 2001 due to the lower  revenues which was offset by cost
reduction initiatives

fiscal 2003 over  fiscal 2002 due to  continued  investment  in next  generation
technology  primarily in the engineering and construction  segment the weakness
of the us dollar versus major european and new zealand currencies  and also the
inclusion of the research  and  development  expenses  from  applanix  after the
acquisition  in july 2003  overall  spending  remained  relatively  constant at
approximately  13 of revenues  all of our research and development  costs have
been expensed as incurred

research and development  spending  decreased by 16 million during fiscal 2002
as compared to fiscal 2001 and represented  13 of revenue  consistent with 13
in fiscal 2001  primarily due to the transfer of  employeerelated  expenses to
our caterpillar joint venture of approximately 28 million partially offset by
an increase in engineering  expenses  associated  with the  introduction  of new
products

 we believe that the development and  introduction of new products are critical
to the our future  success and we expect to continue  active  development of new
products

sales and marketing

sales and  marketing  expenses  increased  by 85  million to 979  million in
fiscal 2003 over fiscal 2002 primarily due to higher  revenue  increased  sales
efforts mostly in emerging geographic areas such as china and russia the impact
of the weaker us dollar in  europe  and the  inclusion  of  applanix  sales and
marketing  expenses not  applicable in the prior fiscal year as a percentage of
revenue sales and marketing expenses decreased from 19 to 18

sales and  marketing  expenses  decreased  by 144  million in fiscal  2002 and
represented  19 of revenue  compared  with 22 in fiscal 2001  during  fiscal
2001  we sold off many of our direct sales offices  which  decreased  sales and
marketing  expenses  by  approximately  70  million  for fiscal  2002  and we
decreased overall compensation travel advertising promotional and trade show
expenses  by  approximately  74  million  for  fiscal  2002  compared  to  the
corresponding period in fiscal 2001

 our future growth will depend in part on the timely  development and continued
viability of the markets in which we currently compete as well as our ability to
continue to identify and exploit new markets for our products

general and administrative

general and administrative  expenses in fiscal 2003 decreased by 14 million to
393  million and  represented  73 of revenues  compared  with 87 in fiscal
2002 in fiscal 2002 we experienced higher bad debt expenses  primarily due to

page

the bankruptcy of a large japanese  distributor  in addition in fiscal 2003 we
incurred 30 million less in information  systems  expenses  these  reductions
were offset in fiscal 2003 by lower  sublease  income  received  expenses  from
applanix after the acquisition in july 2003 and higher compensation costs

general and  administrative  expenses  increased  by 32 million in fiscal 2002
representing 9 of revenue  compared with 8 in fiscal 2001 primarily due to an
increase in bad debt  provisions  related to customers in an uncertain  economic
environment  and bad debt expenses for accounts  written off during the year due
to customer defaults

restructuring charges

restructuring charges of 20 million were recorded in fiscal 2003 11 million
in fiscal  2002  and 36  million  in fiscal  2001  all of which  related  to
severance  costs  except for 03 in 2003 which  related to lease  costs of our
japanese  office  closure  due to the nikon  joint  venture  as a result of the
restructuring  activities  our headcount decreased by 77 49 and 207 in fiscal
2003  2002 and 2001  respectively  as of january 2 2004 the  restructuring
accrual  balance  was  approximately  04  million  which will be paid over the
remaining term of the lease through 2006

1 amortization of goodwill in 2001 only

amortization expense of purchased and other intangibles decreased in fiscal 2003
by approximately 13 million representing 15 of revenue  compared with 2 in
fiscal 2002  the decrease was due to certain  spectra  intangibles  being fully
amortized during fiscal 2003

amortization expense of goodwill  purchased and other intangibles decreased in
fiscal 2002 by approximately 211 million representing 2 of revenue  compared
with 6 in fiscal 2001  the decrease was  primarily  due to the adoption of fas
142 in fiscal  2002 that does not  require  the  amortization  of  goodwill  and
intangible assets with indefinite lives

nonoperating expense net decreased by 16 million or 8 during fiscal 2003 as
compared with fiscal 2002  primarily  due to a reduction in interest  expense of
28 million  offset by an increase in expenses for affiliated  operations  the

page

increase in expenses for affiliated operations is primarily due to the full year
impact  of  transfer  pricing  effects  on  transactions   between  us  and  our
caterpillar joint venture which commenced operations in april 2002 see note 3
of the notes to the consolidated  financial statements for financial information
regarding joint ventures  in addition we recorded  approximately 03 million
relating to our share of the losses in our nikon joint  venture  established  in
2003

in fiscal 2003  interest expense decreased by approximately 28 million due to
continued  debt  repayment  during  the  year of  approximately  518  million
combined  with the effect of lower  interest  rates  offsetting  the lower debt
interest  during the year we recorded  approximately  36 million of interest
expense due to the write off of 23 million of unamortized  debt issuance costs
as a result  of our  debt  refinancing  in june  2003  as well as 13  million
related to the  unamortized  portion of warrants  associated  with the principal
balance of our  subordinated  note see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated
financial statements for financial information regarding our subordinated note

nonoperating  expense  net  decreased  by 18 million  during  fiscal 2002 as
compared with fiscal 2001 as a result of a decrease in net interest  expense of
71 million due to  significant  repayment of debt balances  during the year of
approximately  52 million  combined with the effect of lower  interest  rates
this was partially offset by expenses recorded for affiliated operations of 40
million as a result of transfer  pricing effects on transactions  between us and
our  caterpillar  joint  venture  an increase in foreign  exchange loss of 06
million and a writedown of minority investment of 15 million

income tax provision

our effective income tax rates from continuing operations for fiscal years 2003
2002 and 2001 were 8 25 and 9  respectively  the fiscal 2002 and 2001
income tax rates differ from the us federal  statutory rate of 35 due primarily
to nonus  taxes and the  inability  to realize  the  benefit  of net  operating
losses  the 2003  income tax rate is less than the us federal  statutory  rate
primarily due to the realization of benefits from net operating losses and other
previously reserved deferred tax assets

litigation matters

 from time to time we are involved in  litigation  arising out of the ordinary
course of our business there are no known claims or pending litigation that are
expected to have a material effect on our overall financial position results of
operations or liquidity

offbalance sheet financings and liabilities

other than lease  commitments  incurred in the normal course of business  we do
not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities  guarantee
contracts  retained or  contingent  interests  in  transferred  assets  or any

cash and cash equivalents

in fiscal 2003  our cash and cash  equivalents  increased by 167 million from
fiscal  2002  the  increase was  primarily  due to cash  generated by operating
activities partially offset by cash used in investing activities

in fiscal 2003  cash provided by operating  activities  was 365  million  as
compared to 323  million in fiscal  2002  the  increase  of 41  million was
primarily  driven by the 282 million increase in net income during fiscal 2003
compared  to fiscal  2002  offset by an  increase  in  accounts  receivable  and
inventory and a decrease in accounts  payable  also fiscal 2002 was positively
impacted  by a special  onetime  distribution  of 110  million to us from our
caterpillar  joint  venture  our  ability to  continue  to  generate  cash from
operations will depend in large part on  profitability  the rate of collections
of accounts  receivable  our inventory  turns  and our ability to manage other
areas of working  capital  our accounts  receivable days for sales  outstanding
increased from 58 days at the end of fiscal 2002 to 60 days at the end of fiscal
2003 our inventory  turns decreased from five at the end of fiscal 2002 to four
at the end of fiscal 2003

cash used in investing  activities were 227 million in fiscal 2003 as compared
to 58 million in fiscal 2002 the increase was primarily due to  approximately
48  million  invested  in our nikon joint  venture  upon its  formation  22
million and 43 million cash outlays  related to our  acquisitions  of applanix
and  mensi  respectively  certain  earnout  payments  made as a result of our
previous levelite  acquisition  and increased expenditure on capital equipment
during   fiscal  2003   we  spent   approximately   109  million  on  capital
expenditures

cash  provided by financing  activities  net  was neutral in fiscal  2003  as
compared to 317 million cash used in fiscal 2002  however during fiscal 2003
we repaid approximately 69 million of debtrelated to our previous subordinated
note and credit facility  these debt payments were funded primarily by proceeds
from the issuance of common stock to employees pursuant to our stock option plan
and employee stock  purchase plan of  approximately  139  million  as well as
issuance of common stock under a private equity  placement of 383 million  on
april 14 2003 we sold 3148000  shares of our common stock  no par value per
share to an investor at a price of 1217 per share in an offering  pursuant to
our shelf registration statement the offering resulted in net proceeds to us of
approximately 366 million  approximately 31 million of which was used to pay
down the principal balance on the subordinated note and 56 million was used to
pay down the accrued interest on that note

 we  believe  that  our cash and cash  equivalents  together  with our  credit
facilities  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for
at least the next twelve  months  at january 2 2004  we had 454  million of
cash and cash  equivalents  as well as access to 81  million  of cash under the
terms of our revolver loans

 we expect fiscal 2004 capital  expenditures to be approximately 12 million to
14 million primarily for computer equipment software manufacturing tools and
test equipment  and leasehold improvements  associated with business expansion
decisions  related to how much cash is used for investing are  influenced by the
expected amount of cash to be provided by operations

debt

at the end of fiscal 2003  our total debt was  approximately  905  million as
compared  with  approximately  1385  million at the end of fiscal  2002  this
balance  primarily  consists of 438 million  outstanding under a term loan and
440 million  outstanding under a senior secured revolving credit facility  on
june 25 2003 we obtained a new credit facility  comprising of a term loan and
revolver  in the  amount  of  109  million  that  enabled  us to pay  off  our
indebtedness under our previous credit facility and the subordinated note

the new credit facility is secured by all material assets of our company except
for a portion of assets that are not pledged due to foreign tax  considerations
financial  covenants of the credit facility include leverage  fixed charge and
minimum net worth  tests  at january 2 2004 and as of the date of this report
we are in compliance with all debt covenants the amortized principal interest
and commitment fees due under the credit facility are paid quarterly  under the

page

fouryear term loan portion of the credit facility  we are due to make payments
excluding  interest of  approximately  125 million in each of the next three
fiscal years 2004 2005 and 2006 and 63 million in fiscal 2007

under the terms of the credit  facility  we are  allowed to pay  dividends  and
repurchase  shares of our common  stock up to 25 of net income in the  previous
fiscal year for  additional  discussion of our debt see note 9 of notes to the
consolidated financial statements

risks and uncertainties

you should  carefully  consider the following  risk factors  in addition to the
other  information  contained  in this form 10k and in any other  documents  to
which we refer you in this form 10k  before  purchasing  our  securities  the
risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face

our inability to accurately predict orders and shipments may affect our revenue
expenses and earnings per share

we have not been able in the past to  consistently  predict  when our  customers
will place orders and request shipments so that we cannot always accurately plan
our manufacturing requirements as a result if orders and shipments differ from
what we predict  we may incur additional  expenses and build excess  inventory
which may require additional reserves and allowances  any significant change in
our customers  purchasing  patterns could have a material adverse effect on our
operating results and reported earnings per share for a particular quarter


our  operating  results in each  quarter may be affected by special  conditions
such as seasonality late quarter purchases and other potential issues

due in part to the buying  patterns of our customers  a significant  portion of
our quarterly  revenues occurs from orders  received and immediately  shipped to
customers in the last few weeks and days of each quarter although our operating
expenses  tend  to  remain  fairly  predictable  engineering  and  construction
purchases  tend to occur in early  spring  and  governmental  agencies  tend to
utilize  funds  available  at the  end  of  the  governments  fiscal  year  for
additional purchases at the end of our third fiscal quarter in september of each
year  concentrations of orders sometimes also occur at the end of our other two
fiscal quarters  additionally  a majority of our sales force earns commissions
on a quarterly basis which may cause  concentrations of orders at the end of any
fiscal quarter  if for any reason  expected sales are deferred  orders are not
received  or  shipments  are  delayed a few days at the end of a  quarter  our
operating  results and reported  earnings  per share for that  quarter  could be
significantly impacted


we are dependent on a sole  manufacturer  and assembler for many of our products
and on sole suppliers of critical parts for our products

we are substantially  dependent upon solectron corporation in california  china
and mexico as the exclusive  manufacturing  partner for many of our gps products
previously  manufactured  out of our sunnyvale  facilities  under the agreement
with  solectron  we provide to solectron a  twelvemonth  product  forecast and
place purchase orders with solectron at least thirty calendar days in advance of
the scheduled delivery of products to our customers depending on production lead
time  although purchase orders placed with solectron are cancelable  the terms
of the agreement  would require us to purchase from  solectron all inventory not
returnable  or  usable  by  other  solectron  customers   accordingly   if  we
inaccurately  forecast  demand  for our  products  we may be  unable  to obtain
adequate  manufacturing  capacity  from  solectron to meet  customers  delivery
requirements or we may accumulate  excess  inventories  if such inventories are
not usable by other solectron customers

our current contract with solectron continues in effect until either party gives
the other ninety days written notice

page

solectron is  assembling  all of our component  technologies  products in china
although this  initiative  in china has brought cost savings over  assembling in
california  we may experience quality control issues shipping delays or other
problems associated with manufacturing in china

in addition  we rely on sole suppliers for a number of our critical components
we have experienced shortages of components in the past our current reliance on
sole or a  limited  group of  suppliers  involves  several  risks  including  a
potential  inability  to obtain an adequate  supply of required  components  and
reduced control over pricing any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any
other  circumstance that would require us to seek alternative  sources of supply
or to manufacture  such  components  internally  could  significantly  delay our
ability to ship our products  which could damage relationships with current and
prospective  customers and could harm our reputation and brand and could have a
material adverse effect on our business

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate

our  operating  results  have  fluctuated  and can be  expected  to  continue to
fluctuate in the future on a quarterly  and annual basis as a result of a number
of factors many of which are beyond our control results in any period could be
affected by

     o    changes in market demand
     o    competitive market conditions
     o    market acceptance of existing or new products
     o    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
     o    the cost and availability of components
     o    our ability to manufacture and ship products
     o    the mix of our customer base and sales channels
     o    the mix of products sold
     o    our   ability   to  expand  our  sales  and   marketing   organization
          effectively
     o    our  ability  to  attract  and retain  key  technical  and  managerial
          employees
     o    the  timing of  shipments  of  products  under  contracts  and sale of
          licensing rights and
     o    general global economic conditions

in addition  demand for our products in any quarter or year may vary due to the
seasonal  buying patterns of our customers in the  agricultural  and engineering
and construction industries due to the foregoing factors our operating results
in one or  more  future  periods  are  expected  to be  subject  to  significant
fluctuations  the price of our common stock could decline  substantially in the
event such  fluctuations  result in our  financial  performance  being below the
expectations of public market analysts and investors  which are based primarily
on historical models that are not necessarily  accurate  representations  of the
future

our gross margin is subject to fluctuation

our gross  margin is  affected by a number of factors  including  product  mix
product  pricing  cost of  components  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  and
manufacturing  costs for example  sales of nikon products generally have lower
gross margins as compared to our gps survey  products  absent other factors  a
shift in sales  towards  nikon  would lead to a reduction  in our overall  gross
margins a decline in gross  margin  could  negatively  impact our  earnings  per
share

our  business  is  subject to  disruptions  and  uncertainties  caused by war or
terrorism

acts of war or acts of  terrorism  could have a material  adverse  impact on our
business  operating results and financial  condition  the threat of terrorism
and war and  heightened  security and military  response to this threat  or any
future acts of terrorism may cause further disruption to our economy and create
further  uncertainties  to the extent that such  disruptions  or  uncertainties
result in delays or cancellations  of orders  or the manufacture or shipment of
our products our business  operating results and financial condition could be
materially and adversely affected

page

our  substantial  indebtedness  could  materially  restrict our  operations  and
adversely affect our financial condition

we now have and for the foreseeable  future expect to have a significant level
of indebtedness our substantial indebtedness could

     o    increase our  vulnerability  to general adverse  economic and industry
          conditions
     o    limit  our   ability  to  fund   future   working   capital   capital
          expenditures  research and  development  and other general  corporate
          requirements or to make certain investments that could benefit us
     o    require  us to  dedicate  a  substantial  portion  of our cash flow to
          service interest and principal payments on our debt
     o    limit our  flexibility  to react to  changes in our  business  and the
          industry in which we operate and
     o    limit our ability to borrow additional funds

our credit agreement contains financial covenants

on june 25 2003 we executed a credit agreement with scotia capital and certain
other  banks  which  provides  for  financial  commitments  totaling  up to 175
million  this credit facility contains  financial  covenants  regarding minimum
fixed charge coverage and maximum  leverage ratio which are extremely  sensitive
to changes in earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization or
ebitda  in turn  ebitda is highly  correlated  to  revenues  and costs  if we
default  on one or more  covenants  we will  have to obtain  either  negotiated
waivers or amendments to the credit agreement  if we were unable to obtain such
waivers or amendments  the banks would have the right to accelerate the payment
of our  outstanding  obligations  under the credit  agreement which would have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and viability as an operating
company  in  addition  a default  under one of our debt  instruments  may also
trigger cross  defaults  under our other debt  instruments  an event of default
under any debt instrument if not cured or waived could have a material adverse
effect on us


we rely on key customers

we generate a portion of our revenue from large original equipment manufacturers
such as siemens vdo  automotive  ag and nortel  a reduction or loss of business
with  these  customers  could have a material  adverse  effect on our  financial
condition and results of  operations  there can be no assurance that we will be
able to continue to realize value from these relationships in the future


we are dependent on new products

our future  revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to bring new
products  to market on a timely  basis  we must  continue  to make  significant
investments  in  research  and  development  in order to continue to develop new
products  enhance  existing  products  and achieve  market  acceptance  of such
products  we may incur problems in the future in innovating and introducing new
products  our development stage products may not be successfully  completed or
if developed may not achieve significant customer acceptance if we were unable
to successfully  define  develop and introduce  competitive  new products  and
enhance existing  products  our future results of operations would be adversely
affected  development and manufacturing  schedules for technology  products are
difficult to predict and we might not achieve timely initial customer shipments
of new products  the timely  availability of these products in volume and their
acceptance  by customers  are  important to our future  success  a delay in new
product  introductions  could  have  a  significant  impact  on our  results  of
operations

we may not be able to enter into or maintain important alliances

we believe that in certain business opportunities our success will depend on our
ability to form and  maintain  alliances  with  industry  participants  such as
caterpillar  nikon  mcneilus and cnh global our failure to form and maintain
such  alliances  or the  preemption  of such  alliances  by  actions  of other
competitors  or us  will  adversely  affect our ability to  penetrate  emerging

page

markets  no assurances can be given that we will not  experience  problems from
current  or  future  alliances  or that we will  realize  value  from  any  such
strategic alliances


we are  dependent  on the  availability  of  allocated  bands  within  the radio
frequency spectrum

our gps technology is dependent on the use of the standard  positioning  service
sps  provided  by the us  governments  gps  the gps sps  operates in radio
frequency  bands that are  globally  allocated  for radio  navigation  satellite
services   international  allocations  of  radio  frequency  are  made  by  the
international  telecommunications  union itu a specialized technical agency
of  the  united  nations  these  allocations  are  further  governed  by  radio
regulations  that have  treaty  status and which may be subject to  modification
every two to three years by the world radio communication conference

any  itu  reallocation  of  radio  frequency  bands  including  frequency  band
segmentation  or sharing of spectrum  may materially  and adversely  affect the
utility and reliability of our products  which would in turn cause a material
adverse  effect on our operating  results  many of our products use other radio
frequency  bands  together  with  the  gps  signal  to  provide  enhanced  gps
capabilities   such  as  realtime   kinematics   precision   the   continuing
availability of these nongps radio frequencies is essential to provide enhanced
gps products to our precision survey markets any regulatory changes in spectrum
allocation or in allowable  operating  conditions  may  materially and adversely
affect the utility and reliability of our products  which would in turn cause
a material adverse effect on our operating results

in  addition  unwanted  emissions  from  mobile  satellite  services  and other
equipment  operating in adjacent  frequency  bands or inband from  licensed and
unlicensed   devices  may  materially  and  adversely  affect  the  utility  and
reliability of our products  which could result in a material adverse effect on
our  operating  results  the  fcc  continually  receives  proposals  for  novel
technologies and services such as ultrawideband  technologies  which may seek
to operate in or across  the radio  frequency  bands currently used by the gps
sps and other public safety services  adverse  decisions by the fcc that result
in harmful interference to the delivery of the gps sps and other radio frequency
spectrum  also used in our  products may  materially  and  adversely  affect the
utility  and  reliability  of our  products  which  could  result in a material
adverse effect on our business and financial condition

we are subject to the adverse impact of radio frequency congestion

we have  certain  products  such  as gps rtk  systems  surveying  and  mapping
systems  and robotic total stations  that use integrated  radio  communication
technology requiring access to available radio frequencies  allocated by the fcc
or the ntia in the case of  federal  government  users of this  equipment  for
which the end user is  required  to obtain a license in order to  operate  their
equipment  in addition  access to these frequencies by state agencies is under
management  by  state  radio   communications   coordinators   some  bands  are
experiencing  congestion  that excludes their  availability  for access by state
agencies  in  some  states  including  the  state  of  california   to  reduce
congestion the fcc announced that it will require migration of radio technology
from wideband to narrowband operations in these bands in december 2003 the fcc
stayed the effectiveness of its new rules until it acts on petitions  requesting
a reconsideration of this new requirement  the stay is indefinite at this point
and the outcome of this  proceeding  is unknown at this time  an  inability  to
obtain access to these radio  frequencies by end users  and for new products to
comply  with fcc  requirements  could have an adverse  effect on our  operating
results

many of our products rely on the gps satellite system

the gps  satellites  and their  ground  support  systems are complex  electronic
systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage the
satellites were  originally  designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject
to damage by the hostile space  environment in which they operate  however  of
the current  deployment  of 28  satellites  in place  some have already been in
operation  for 13 years  to repair  damaged  or  malfunctioning  satellites  is
currently not economically  feasible if a significant number of satellites were
to  become  inoperable  there  could be a  substantial  delay  before  they are
replaced with new satellites  a reduction in the number of operating satellites
may impair the  current  utility of the gps system and the growth of current and
additional market opportunities

in  addition  there can be no  assurance  that the us  government  will  remain
committed to the operation and maintenance of gps satellites over a long period
or that the policies of the us government for the use of gps without charge will

page

remain  unchanged  however  a 1996 presidential  decision  directive marks the
first time in the  evolution  of gps that access for civilian use free of direct
user fees is specifically  recognized and supported by presidential  policy  in
addition   presidential   policy  has  been   complemented   by   corresponding
legislation signed into law because of everincreasing commercial applications
of gps other us government  agencies may become involved in the  administration
or the regulation of the use of gps signals  any of the foregoing factors could
affect the  willingness  of buyers of our products to select  gpsbased  systems
instead of products based on competing technologies

many of our products also use signals from systems that augment gps such as the
wide area  augmentation  system  waas  and  national  differential  gps system
ndgps  many  of  these  augmentation  systems  are  operated  by the  federal
government and rely on continued  funding and maintenance of these systems  any
curtailment  of the  operating  capability  of these  systems  could  result  in
decreased user capability thereby impacting our markets

any  resulting  change in market  demand for gps products  could have a material
adverse effect on our financial results for example  european governments have
expressed interest in building an independent satellite navigation system known
as galileo  depending on the as yet  undetermined  design and operation of this
system  there  may be  interference  to the  delivery  of the  gps  sps and may
materially  and  adversely  affect the utility and  reliability  of our products
which could result in a material  adverse  effect on our business and  operating
results

we face risks in investing in and integrating new acquisitions

acquisitions of companies  divisions of companies  or products entail numerous
risks including

     o    potential inability to successfully  integrate acquired operations and
          products or to realize cost savings or other anticipated benefits from
          integration
     o    diversion of managements attention
     o    loss of key employees of acquired operations
     o    the difficulty of assimilating geographically dispersed operations and
          personnel of the acquired companies
     o    the potential disruption of our ongoing business
     o    unanticipated expenses related to such integration
     o    the correct  assessment  of the  relative  percentages  of  inprocess
          research and development  expense that can be immediately  written off
          as compared to the amount which must be amortized over the appropriate
          life of the asset
     o    the impairment of relationships with employees and customers of either
          an acquired company or our own business
     o    the potential unknown  liabilities  associated with acquired business
          and
     o    inability  to  recover  strategic  investments  in  development  stage
          entities

as a result  of such  acquisitions  we have  significant  assets  that  include
goodwill and other purchased intangibles the testing of these intangibles under
established  accounting  guidelines for impairment  requires  significant use of
judgment  and  assumptions   changes  in  business   conditions  could  require
adjustments to the valuation of these assets in addition  losses incurred by a
company in which we have an investment may have a direct impact on our financial
statements  or could  result  in our  having  to  writedown  the  value of such
investment  any such problems in integration or adjustments to the value of the
assets  acquired  could harm our  growth  strategy  and have a material  adverse
effect on our business financial condition and compliance with debt covenants

we face competition in our markets

our markets are highly  competitive  and we expect that both direct and indirect
competition  will  increase in the  future  our  overall  competitive  position
depends on a number of factors  including the price  quality and performance of
our products  the level of customer service  the development of new technology
and our ability to participate in emerging markets  within each of our markets
we encounter direct  competition from other gps optical and laser suppliers and
competition may intensify from various larger us and nonus  competitors and new
market entrants some of which may be our current customers  the competition in
the future may in some cases  result in price reductions  reduced margins or
loss of market share  any of which could  materially  and adversely  affect our

page

business operating results and financial condition we believe that our ability
to  compete   successfully  in  the  future  against   existing  and  additional
competitors  will  depend  largely on our  ability to execute  our  strategy  to
provide systems and products with significantly differentiated features compared
to currently available  products  we may not be able to implement this strategy
successfully and our products may not be competitive with other technologies or
products  that  may  be  developed  by  our  competitors   many  of  whom  have
significantly greater financial technical manufacturing  marketing sales and
other resources than we do

we are dependent on proprietary technology

our future success and  competitive  position is dependent upon our  proprietary
technology  and we rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright law to
protect our  intellectual  property  the patents owned or licensed by us may be
invalidated  circumvented  and  challenged  the rights  granted  under  these
patents  may not  provide  competitive  advantages  to us any of our pending or
future  patent  applications  may not be issued  within  the scope of the claims
sought by us if at all

others may develop  technologies that are similar or superior to our technology
duplicate our  technology or design around the patents owned by us in addition
effective  copyright  patent and trade secret  protection  may be  unavailable
limited  or not  applied  for in  certain  countries  the steps  taken by us to
protect  our  technology  might  not  prevent  the   misappropriation   of  such
technology

the value of our products relies  substantially  on our technical  innovation in
fields in which there are many current patent filings  we recognize that as new
patents  are  issued or are  brought  to our  attention  by the  holders of such
patents it may be necessary for us to withdraw products from the market take a
license from such patent  holders  or redesign our products  we do not believe
any of our products  currently  infringe patents or other proprietary  rights of
third  parties  but we cannot be certain  they do not do so in  addition  the
legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard  intellectual property or
to defend against  litigation could become a significant  expense of operations
such  events  could  have  a  material   adverse   effect  on  our  revenues  or
profitability

we must carefully manage our future growth

growth in our sales or continued  expansion in the scope of our operations could
strain our current management financial manufacturing and other resources and
may require us to implement  and improve a variety of  operating  financial and
other systems procedures and controls specifically we have experienced strain
in our  financial  and order  management  system  we are  expanding  our sales
accounting   manufacturing   and  other  information  systems  to  meet  these
challenges  these  systems  procedures  or  controls  may not be  adequate to
support our  operations and may not be designed  implemented  or improved in a
costeffective and timely manner  any failure to implement  improve and expand
such systems  procedures  and controls in a timely and efficient  manner could
harm our growth  strategy  and  adversely  affect our  financial  condition  and
ability to achieve our business objectives

we are dependent on retaining and  attracting  highly  skilled  development  and
managerial personnel

our ability to maintain our competitive technological position will depend in a
large part on our ability to attract  motivate  and retain  highly  qualified
development and managerial personnel competition for qualified employees in our
industry and location is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be
able to attract  motivate  and retain enough qualified employees necessary for
the future continued development of our business and products

we may encounter problems associated with international operations and sales

our customers are located throughout the world sales to unaffiliated  customers
in nonus locations represented  approximately 51 of our revenues in our fiscal
year 2003  49 in our  fiscal  year 2002 and 50 in our  fiscal  year 2001  in
addition we have significant international operations  including manufacturing
facilities  sales  personnel  and customer  support  operations  we have sales
offices  outside the us our nonus  manufacturing  facilities are in sweden and
germany  and we have a  regional  fulfillment  center in the  netherlands  our
nonus presence exposes us to risks not faced by wholly us companies

page

specifically  we have  experienced  issues  relating to  integration  of nonus
operations greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection longer payment
cycles and currency  fluctuations  additionally  we face the following risks
among others

     o    unexpected changes in regulatory requirements
     o    tariffs and other trade barriers
     o    political   legal  and  economic   instability  in  nonus   markets
          particularly in those markets in which we maintain  manufacturing  and
          research facilities
     o    difficulties in staffing and management
     o    language and cultural barriers
     o    seasonal  reductions  in business  activities  in the summer months in
          europe and some other countries
     o    war and acts of terrorism and
     o    potentially adverse tax consequences

in certain nonus markets there may be reluctance to purchase products based on
gps technology given the control of gps by the us government

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates

a significant  portion of our business is conducted  outside the united  states
and as such we face exposure to adverse  movements in nonus currency  exchange
rates  these  exposures may change over time as business  practices  evolve and
could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows in
fiscal 2003 the us dollar weakened against several major currencies in which we
do business adversely impacting our financial results

currently we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets
and liabilities  denominated in nonfunctional  currencies and periodically will
hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows the hedging activities undertaken
by us are  intended  to offset the impact of  currency  fluctuations  on certain
nonfunctional  currency assets and  liabilities  our attempts to hedge against
these  risks may not be  successful  resulting  in an adverse  impact on our net
income

we are subject to the impact of governmental and other similar certifications

we  market  certain  products  that are  subject  to  governmental  and  similar
certifications  before  they can be sold  for  example  ce  certification  for
radiated  emissions is required  for most gps  receiver and data  communications
products sold in the european union an inability to obtain such  certifications
in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our operating results  also
our products that use integrated radio  communication  technology require an end
user to obtain  licensing from the federal  communications  commission fcc for
frequencyband  usage  these are secondary licenses that are subject to certain
restrictions  during the fourth quarter of 1998 the fcc temporarily  suspended
the  issuance  of  licenses  for certain of our  realtime  kinematics  products
because of interference  with certain other users of similar radio  frequencies
an inability or delay in obtaining such  certifications  or changes to the rules
by the fcc could  adversely  affect our ability to bring our  products to market
which could harm our customer  relationships  and have a material adverse effect
on our business

the volatility of our stock price could adversely  affect your investment in our
common stock

the market  price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  highly
volatile  during fiscal 2003  our stock price ranged from 868 to 2560  we
believe  that a variety of factors  could cause the price of our common stock to
fluctuate perhaps substantially including

     o    announcements  and rumors of  developments  related to our business or
          the industry in which we compete
     o    quarterly  fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results
          and order levels
     o    general conditions in the worldwide economy including fluctuations in
          interest rates
     o    announcements of technological innovations
     o    new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors
     o    developments  in patents  or other  intellectual  property  rights and
          litigation
     o    developments  in our  relationships  with our customers and suppliers
          and
     o    any significant acts of terrorism against the united states

page

in  addition  in recent  years the stock  market in general and the markets for
shares of hightech  companies in particular  have experienced  extreme price
fluctuations  which have often been  unrelated to the operating  performance  of
affected  companies  any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect
the market price of our common  stock  and the market price of our common stock
may decline

we are subject to  environmental  laws and potential  exposure to  environmental
liabilities

we are  subject  to  various  federal  state and local  environmental  laws and
regulations  that govern our operations  including the handling and disposal of
nonhazardous  and  hazardous  wastes  and emissions  and  discharges  into the
environment  failure to comply with such laws and  regulations  could result in
costs for corrective action  penalties or the imposition of other liabilities
we also are subject to laws and regulations  that impose  liability and cleanup
responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment  under
certain of these laws and  regulations  a current or previous owner or operator
of property may be liable for the costs of remediating  hazardous  substances or
petroleum products on or from its property  without regard to whether the owner
or operator knew of or caused the contamination as well as incur liability to
third  parties  impacted by such  contamination  the presence of or failure to
remediate  properly  such substances  could adversely  affect the value and the
ability to transfer or encumber  such  property  based on  currently  available
information   although  there  can  be  no  assurance  we  believe  that  such
liabilities will not have a material impact on our business

provisions in our charter  documents and under  california  law could prevent or
delay a change of  control  which could  reduce the market  price of our common
stock

certain  provisions of our articles of  incorporation  as amended and restated
our bylaws as amended and restated  and the california general corporation law
may be deemed to have an antitakeover effect and could discourage a third party
from acquiring or make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  control
of us without  approval of our board of directors  these  provisions could also
limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for
shares of our common stock  certain  provisions allow the board of directors to
authorize the issuance of preferred  stock with rights  superior to those of the
common stock

we have adopted a preferred shares rights agreement commonly known as a poison
pill the  provisions  described  above  our poison pill and provisions of the
california  general  corporation  law may  discourage  delay or prevent a third
party from acquiring us




item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk

we are exposed to market risk  related to changes in interest  rates and foreign
currency  exchange rates  we use certain  derivative  financial  instruments to
manage  these  risks  we  do  not  use  derivative  financial  instruments  for
speculative  or  trading  purposes   all  financial  instruments  are  used  in
accordance with policies approved by our board of directors

market interest rate risk

we are exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing  interest rates
under our  secured  credit  facility  our credit  facility  is  comprised  of a
threeyear  us  dollaronly  revolver  that  expires  on june 25  2006  and a
fouryear term loan that expires on june 25 2007  borrowings  under the credit
facility have interest  payments based on a floating rate of libor plus a number
of basis  points tied to a formula  based on our  leverage  ratio  the revolver
matures  on june  25  2006  and has an  outstanding  principal  balance  of 44
million  while the term loan  matures on june 25  2007 and has an  outstanding
principal  balance of 438  million  as of january 2 2004 all in us currency
only  the threemonth  libor  effective rate at january 2 2004 was 1155  a
hypothetical   10  increase  in   threemonth   libor  rates  could  result  in
approximately  101790  annual  increase  in interest  expense on the  existing

page

principal balances we have hedged the market risk with an interest rate swap on
50 of our term loan the rate on that interest rate swap is 2517

 the  hypothetical  changes and  assumptions  made above will be different from
what  actually  occurs  in the  future  furthermore  the  computations  do not
anticipate  actions that may be taken by our management  should the hypothetical
market changes actually occur over time as a result actual earnings effects in
the future will differ from those quantified above

foreign currency exchange rate risk

we enter into foreign  exchange  forward  contracts  to minimize the  shortterm
impact of  foreign  currency  fluctuations  on certain  trade and  intercompany
receivables and payables  primarily  denominated in australian  canadian  new
zealand  and  swedish  currencies  the  euro  and the  british  pound  these
contracts  reduce the exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements as the
gains and losses  associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset
with the gains and losses on the forward contracts these instruments are marked
to market through  earnings  every period and generally  range from one to three
months in  original  maturity  we do not enter into  foreign  exchange  forward
contract for trading purposes

foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of january 2 2004 and january
3 2003 are summarized as follows in thousands


                            january 2 2004                january 3 2003
                                            
                      nominal amount  fair value   nominal amount   fair value

 we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
position utilizing our current hedging strategy

from  time to time  we may also  utilize  forward  foreign  exchange  contracts
designated  as cash flow hedges of  operational  exposures  represented  by firm
backlog  orders to specific  accounts over a specific  period of time we record
changes  in  the  fair  value  of  cash  flow  hedges  in   accumulated   other
comprehensive  income loss  until the firm backlog  transaction  ships  upon
recognition of revenue we reclassify the gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to
the  statement  of  operations  the  critical  terms of the cash  flow  hedging
instruments are the same as the underlying forecasted transactions  the changes
in fair value of the  derivatives are intended to offset changes in the expected
cash  flow  from  the  forecasted  transactions   all  forward  contracts  have
maturities of less than 12 months for the fiscal year ended january 3 2003 we
recorded a gain of  57000  reflecting  the net  change  and ending  balance in
relation to a firm backlog hedge we did not hedge against backlog orders during
fiscal 2003

technology overview

     a major portion of our revenues is derived from applying gps to terrestrial
applications  gps is a system of 24 orbiting  satellites and associated  ground
control that is funded and  maintained by the u s  government and is available
worldwide free of charge gps positioning is based on a technique that precisely
measures  distances from four or more  satellites  the satellites  continuously
transmit precisely timed radio signals using extremely accurate atomic clocks a
gps receiver  measures  distances from the satellites in view by determining the
travel time of a signal from the satellite to the receiver  and then uses those
distances to compute its position under normal circumstances a standalone gps
receiver is able to calculate its position at any point on earth in the earths
atmosphere or in lower earth orbit to approximately 10 meters 24 hours a day
much better  accuracies are possible  through a technique  called  differential
gps in addition gps provides extremely accurate time measurement

     the  usefulness of gps is dependent  upon the locations of the receiver and
the gps  satellites  that are above the horizon at any given time  reception of
gps signals  requires  lineofsight  visibility  between the satellites and the
receiver  which can be blocked by  buildings  hills  and dense  foliage  the
receiver must have a line of sight to at least four  satellites to determine its
latitude longitude altitude and time the accuracy of gps may also be limited
by distortion of gps signals from ionospheric and other atmospheric  conditions
and intentional or inadvertent  signal  interference or selective  availability
selective  availability  which was the largest component of gps distortion  is
controlled by the us department of defense and was deactivated on may 1 2000

     our  gps  products  are  based  on  proprietary  receiver  technology  the
convergence of  positioning  wireless  and  information  technologies  enables
significant  new value to be added to positioning  systems  thereby  creating a
more robust solution for the user in addition  recent developments in wireless
technology  and  deployments  of wireless  networks have enabled less  expensive
wireless communications  these developments allow for the efficient transfer of
position data to locations away from the positioning field device  allowing the
data to be accessed by more users and thereby increasing productivity

     our laser and optical  products  measure  distances  and angles  accurately
using light  we generally  use  commercially  available  laser diodes to create
light beams for distance  measurement  in addition  our proprietary  precision
mechanics  and software  algorithms  in these  products  combine to give robust
accurate  distance  and  angle  measurements  for  a  variety  of  agricultural
surveying and construction applications



business strategy


     our business  strategy  leverages our expertise in  positioning  to provide
solutions for our customers built around several key initiatives

o    focus on attractive  markets  we focus on markets that offer potential for
     revenue growth profitability and market leadership

o    create innovative  solutions that provide significant  economic benefits to
     our customers  we seek to apply our technology to  applications  for which
     position  data has a high value  we  anticipate  that further  advances in
     positioning wireless and information technologies will enable new classes
     of solutions to emerge that will create new opportunities

o    develop  distribution  channels  to best  access our markets  we utilize a
     range of  distribution  channels  to best  serve  the  needs of  individual
     markets these channels can include independent dealers  direct sales oem
     sales and distribution  alliances with key partners  in addition we will
     continue to extend our international distribution


business segments and markets

     we are organized into four main operating segments encompassing our various
applications and product lines  engineering and construction  field solutions
component  technologies  and  mobile  solutions  we also  operate  in  smaller
business  areas  primarily  military  and  advanced  systems  and tripod  data
systems  which aggregate into the portfolio business segment  our segments are
distinguished  by the markets  they serve  each  division  is  responsible  for
product development  marketing sales strategy  financial performance and is
headed by a general manager

segment realignment

     in the first fiscal  quarter of 2002  we realigned  two of our  reportable
segments  the agriculture  segment was combined with the mapping and geographic
information systems gis business to form field solutions mapping and gis were
previously part of fleet and asset management  the mobile positioning  business
that was part of fleet and asset management is now mobile solutions

     we began  breaking  out mobile  solutions as a separate  reporting  segment
during the first quarter of 2002 to address the growing importance of the mobile
asset management business and its impact on our profitability at the same time
we combined our gis and  agriculture  businesses to create a new segment  called
field  solutions  in  order to  recognize  the  synergies  and  similar  product
requirements between the two businesses


engineering and construction

     we employ gps optical lasers communications  and information technology
to  pursue  the  opportunities  in the  engineering  and  construction  industry
segment  products in this segment  increase  productivity  and accuracy for the
entire  construction  process  including the initial survey  planning  design
earthmoving  and  building  phases  these  products  are aimed at making  each
individual  task more  efficient  as well as speeding up the entire  process by
improving  information flow from one step to the next and  facilitating  faster
redesign when needed

     for example  our gps and robotic optical technology allows surveying tasks
to be completed faster and with a smaller crew similarly  construction machine
guidance  products  allow the  operator  to  achieve  the  desired  landform  by
eliminating  stakeout and reducing  rework  these steps in the operation can be
readily linked  together with data  collection  modules and software to minimize
the time and effort required to get the job done accurately

     we sell and  distribute  our products  from this  segment  through a global
network of independent dealers and our sales staff this channel is supplemented
by  relationships  that create  additional  channel breadth  including our joint
venture with caterpillar and private branding arrangements with other companies

     competition  in this segment  comes from  companies  that provide  optical
laser  or gps  positioning  products  our  principal  competitors  are  topcon
corporation and leica  geosystems  price points in this segment range from less
than 1000 for certain  laser  systems to  approximately  125000  for a high
precision threedimensional machine control system

grading and road construction applications


field solutions

     our  field  solutions   division   addresses  the  two  business  areas  of
agriculture and geographical  information  system gis  products and solutions
from the gis business  area are  targeted at  collecting  feature and  attribute
information  in  the  field  to be  used  within  gis  databases  and  providing
positionrelated  information  directly to a person  working in the field in the
mobile gis market  the manner in which information is presented or collected is
of key importance to the customer as well as the applicability and value of the
information itself

     in the agricultural  market our products provide  navigation  guidance for
tractors and other farm equipment used in spraying  planting  cultivation and
harvesting  applications  the  benefits to the farmer  include  faster  machine
operation  higher yields  and lower consumption of chemicals  we also provide
positioning   solutions   for  leveling   agricultural   fields  in   irrigation
applications  and  aligning  drainage  systems  to better  manage  water flow in
fields

     our distribution to the agricultural  market is through multiple  channels
revenue is generated  through  independent  dealers and through partners such as
cnh  global  competitors  in  this  market  are  either  vertically  integrated
implement  companies  such  as  john  deere  or  agricultural   instrumentation
suppliers such as raven csi wireless and integrinautics

     the other  principle  market  within  field  solutions is gis our products
enable the efficient acquisition of features attributes and positions of fixed
infrastructure and natural resource assets an example of the type of data being
collected  would  be  that of a  utility  company  performing  a  survey  of its
transmission  poles  including the age and condition of each telephone pole our
handheld unit enables this data to be collected and  automatically  stored while
confirming the location of the asset  the collected data can then be downloaded
into a gis  database  this stored data could later be used to navigate  back to
any individual asset or item for maintenance or data update

     distribution  for gis  applications  is  primarily  through  a  network  of
independent dealers and business partners supported by an internal sales staff
competitors  in this market are  typically  either survey  instrument  companies
having gps  technology  andor  consumer gps  companies  two examples are leica
geosystems and garmin

     approximate  price points in this segment  range from 2500 for a handheld
unit to 35000 for a fully automated farm equipment control system

representative products sold within this segment include

technologies and products  internally  enter into joint ventures with strategic
partners  resell another companys  product  or acquire all or part of another
company


acquisitions


      we have  acquired a number of companies in the past and we expect to make
acquisitions  in  the  future   mergers  and  acquisitions  of  hightechnology
companies are inherently  risky  no assurance can be given that our previous or
future  acquisitions will be successful or will not materially  adversely affect
our  financial  condition  or  operating  results  the  risks  associated  with
acquisitions are more fully discussed in the risks and  uncertainties  section
contained in part ii item 7 of this report


     levelite  on august 15 2002 we acquired levelite  technology  inc this
was a  strategic  acquisition  for  us  as it not  only  extended  the  product
portfolio of our commercial  construction business in the entrylevel market for
laserlevels  but it also  strengthened  our  presence in certain  distribution
channels such as the construction supply houses and power tool manufacturers


caterpillar joint venture

     on april 1 2002 trimble and caterpillar  established and began operations
of a joint venture called  caterpillar  trimble  control  technologies  llc in
which each company has a 50 ownership  stake and have equal voting rights  the
purpose of this  joint  venture is to  develop  the next  generation  of machine
control products for the construction and mining markets

      today  we sell  construction  machine  control  products to  contractors
through our dealer channel  for installation on bulldozers  motorgraders  and
excavators  that are already in the field the  aftermarket  however  both
companies believe that this aftermarket  solution will spur future demand for
a  machine  control  product  that  can be  integrated  into the  design  of new
caterpillar  machines  while  also still  being  available  for  aftermarket
installation


patents licenses and intellectual property

specifically  trimble with the sextant logo aggps geoexplorer and gps
total  station  are  examples  of  trademarks  of trimble  navigation  limited
registered in the united states and other countries  additional  trademarks are
pending registration

     although we believe that our patents and trademarks  have value  we cannot
be sure that  those  patents  and  trademarks  or any  additional  patents  and
trademarks  that  may  be  obtained  in  the  future  will  provide  meaningful
protection from  competition  we actively  develop and protect our intellectual
property through a program of patenting enforcement and licensing

     we do not  believe  that  any of our  products  infringe  patent  or  other
proprietary  rights of third parties  but we cannot be certain that they do not
do so see note 20 of the notes to the consolidated  financial  statements if
infringement is alleged legal defense costs could be material and there can be
no  assurance  that  the  necessary  licenses  could  be  obtained  on  terms or
conditions that would not have a material adverse effect on our profitability


sales and marketing

     we currently  have  regional  sales  offices  throughout  north america and
europe  offices serving the rest of the world include australia  china japan
philippines  new zealand  singapore  and united arab emirates  we tailor the
distribution channel to the needs of the product and regional market therefore
we have a number of forms of sales channel solutions around the world


north america

     we sell our  products  in the united  states and canada  primarily  through
dealers   distributors   and  authorized  representatives   this  channel  is
supplemented  and  supported  by our  employees  who  provide  additional  sales
support  in some cases  where third party  distribution  is not available  we
utilize a direct sales force  we also utilize  distribution  alliances  and oem
relationships with other companies as a means to serve selected markets


international

     we market to  endusers  through a network of dealers and  distributors  in
more than 85  countries  distributors  carry one or more product  lines and are
generally limited to selling either in one country or in a portion of a country
we  occasionally  grant  exclusive  rights to  market  certain  products  within
specified countries

     sales  to  unaffiliated  customers  outside  the  united  states  comprised
approximately  49 in 2002 50 in 2001 and 52 in 2000 during the 2002 fiscal
year north and south america  represented 55 and europe  the middle east and
africa  represented  32 and asia  represented  13 in fiscal 2002 the united
states  comprised  approximately  51 and germany  16 of sales to  unaffiliated
customers


support and warranty

     the warranty  periods for our products are generally  between one and three
years from date of shipment  selected  military  programs may require  extended
warranty periods  and certain products sold by our tds subsidiary have a 90day
warranty period we support our gps products through a circuit board replacement
program from locations in the united  kingdom  germany  japan  and the united
states  the repair and  calibration of our nongps  products are available from
companyowned or authorized  facilities  we reimburse  dealers and distributors
for all authorized warranty repairs they perform

     while we  engage in  extensive  product  quality  programs  and  processes
including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers
our warranty  obligation is affected by product  failure rates  material usage
and service  delivery  costs  incurred in correcting a product  failure  should
actual product failure rates  material usage or service  delivery costs differ
from the  estimates  revisions to the  estimated  warranty  accrual and related
costs may be required


seasonality of business

      our  revenues  are  affected by seasonal  buying  patterns in some of our
business  areas  over half of our total revenue comes from our  engineering and
construction  business  which  has the  biggest  seasonal  impact  on our total
revenue this business and therefore our total revenue is seasonally strongest
during the second quarter due to the start of the construction  buying season in
the northern  hemisphere  in spring  typically  we expect the first and fourth
quarters to be the  seasonal  lows due to the lack of  construction  and farming
during the winter  months  if other  factors  such as  economic  conditions  or
underlying growth in the business are removed the historical variability in our
total  quarterly  revenue  from  seasonality  has  generally  been  less than 10
percent


working capital

     our  working  capital  needs  are  typically  for   inventories   accounts
receivable  and shortterm debt as the business is generally  dependent upon a
steady stream of new products  some amount of working capital is devoted to the
ramp up and ramp down of product  volumes as new  products  get  introduced  and
older models are taken out of production


backlog

     in most of our markets  the time between  order  placement and shipment is
short therefore we believe that backlog is not a reliable indicator of present
or future business conditions


manufacturing

     manufacturing  for most of our gps products is  subcontracted  to solectron
corporation   solectron  is   responsible   for   substantially   all  material
procurement  assembly  and testing  we continue to manage  product  design up
through pilot  production for the  subcontracted  products  and we are directly
involved in qualifying  suppliers and key  components  used in all our products
during  the fourth  quarter  of 2002  solectron  began  assembling  some of our
component technologies products in china our current contract with solectron is
due to expire in august 2003

     we  manufacture  laser and  opticsbased  products at our plants in dayton
ohio  danderyd  sweden and jena and  kaiserslautern  germany  some of these
products or portions of these products are also  subcontracted  to third parties
for assembly

     most of the  components  used in our products are  standard  parts  readily
available from more than one supplier  a few components are from sole suppliers
or are custom parts unique to our company  while custom parts make our products
hard to imitate  they also  represent a  manufacturing  risk due to the lack of
alternative   suppliers   if  these  parts  became  unavailable   redesign  or
modification of our products could be required in addition suppliers may cease
manufacturing common components  replacing them with newer parts which require
requalification  these  risks  could  cause an  interruption  in our ability to
provide a steady stream of products to our customers


research and development

     we  believe  that  our  competitive  position  is  maintained  through  the
development and  introduction of new products having improved  features  better
performance  smaller size and weight  lower cost or some combination of these
factors  we invest  substantially  in the development of new products  we also
make significant investment in the positioning  communication  and information
technologies  that  underlie our products  and will likely  provide  competitive
advantages

     recent  developments  have produced  small  lowpower  oem gps receivers
accurate and versatile  rotating lasers for  construction  use and light weight
and compact gps surveying rovers

     our research and  development  expenditure  net of reimbursed  amounts was
612 million for fiscal 2002  629 million for fiscal 2001 and 465 million
for fiscal 2000

      we expect to continue investing in research and development with the goal
of maintaining or improving our competitive position as well as the goal of
entering new markets and satisfying new needs for positioning related solutions
there can be no assurance that we will succeed in doing so

free on  board  shipping  point  term  means  that  the  seller  fulfills  the
obligation  to deliver  when the goods have  passed  over the ships rail at the
named  port of  shipment  this  means  that the buyer has to bear all costs and
risks of loss of or damage to the goods from that point  the fob term  requires
the seller to clear the goods for export fca free carrier shipping point term
means that the seller  fulfills  the  obligation  to deliver  when the goods are
handed over cleared for export and into the charge of the carrier named by the
buyer at the named  place or point  if no  precise  point is  indicated  by the
buyer  the  seller may choose  within the place or range  stipulated  where the
carrier shall take the goods into carriers charge

     our shipment  terms for domestic  orders are typically fob shipping  point
international  orders  fulfilled  from  our  european  distribution  center  are
typically shipped fca shipping point other international orders are shipped fob
destination  and accordingly these  international  orders are not recognized as
revenue until the product is delivered and title has transferred

     revenues  from  purchased  extended  warranty  and support  agreements  are
deferred and recognized  ratably over the term of the  warrantysupport  period
substantially  all  technology  licenses and research  revenue have consisted of
initial license fees and royalties  which were recognized when earned provided
we had no remaining obligations

     sales to distributors and resellers are recognized upon shipment  providing
that there is evidence of such an arrangement  through a distribution  agreement
or purchase order title has transferred  no remaining performance  obligations
exist  the price and terms of the sale are fixed  and  collection is probable
distributors and resellers do not have a right of return

     our  software  arrangements  consist  of a  license  fee and post  contract
customer support pcs we have established  vendor specific  objective evidence
vsoe of fair  value for our pcs  contracts  based on the price of the  renewal
rate  the  remaining  value of the  software  arrangement  is  allocated to the
license fee using the residual  method  which  revenue is primarily  recognized
when the software  has been  delivered  and there are no remaining  obligations
revenue from pcs is recognized ratably over the period of the pcs agreement


allowance for doubtful accounts

     we evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts  receivable based on a
number of factors  in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customers
inability to meet its financial  obligations to us a specific allowance for bad
debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the  recognized  receivable to the
estimated  amount we believe  will  ultimately  be  collected  in  addition  to
specific  customer  identification  of potential bad debts bad debt charges are
recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past
due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding


inventory valuation

     our inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market we use a standard
cost  accounting  system to value  inventory and these  standards are reviewed a
minimum  of  once  a  year  and  multiple  times  a  year  in  our  most  active
manufacturing  plants  we adjust the inventory  value for estimated  excess and
obsolete inventory based on managements  assessment of future demand and market
conditions if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than
those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required


deferred taxes

     deferred  taxes are  provided on a liability  method  whereby  deferred tax
assets  are  recognized  for  deductible  temporary   differences  and  deferred
liabilities  are  recognized  for  taxable  temporary   differences   temporary
differences  are the  differences  between  the  reported  amounts of assets and
liabilities and their tax bases  deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation
allowance  when it is determined to be more likely than not that some portion or
all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  in evaluating the need for
a valuation  allowance  we consider  future taxable  income  resolution of tax
uncertainties and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  if we determine
that we would not be able to realize all or part of our  deferred  tax assets in
the future an adjustment to the carrying value of the deferred tax assets would
be charged to income in the period in which such determination was made


goodwill and other purchased intangible assets

     we have  significant  intangible  assets on our balance  sheet that include
goodwill  and  other  purchased  intangibles  related  to  acquisitions  at the
beginning of fiscal 2002 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards
no 141 sfas 141  business  combinations  and no 142  goodwill and other
intangible assets sfas 142  application of the nonamortization  provisions
of sfas 142 significantly  reduced amortization expense of purchased intangibles
and goodwill to  approximately  83 million for the fiscal year 2002 from 294
million in the prior year we reclassified  identifiable  intangible assets with
indefinite lives and net book value of 736 million as defined by sfas 142 to
goodwill at the date of adoption

     for comparative purposes the pro forma adjusted net income per share
excluding amortization of goodwill distribution channel and assembled
workforce is as follows

     in assessing the  recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible
assets we must make assumptions about the estimated future cash flows and other
factors to determine  the fair value of these assets  assumptions  about future
revenue and cash flows require significant judgment because of the current state
of the economy the fluctuation of actual revenue and the timing of expenses

     for goodwill the annual impairment evaluation includes a comparison of the
carrying  value of the reporting  unit  including  goodwill to that  reporting
units fair value  if the  reporting  units  estimated  fair value exceeds the
reporting units carrying value no impairment of goodwill  exists  if the fair
value of the reporting unit does not exceed the units carrying  value  then an
additional  analysis is performed  to allocate  the fair value of the  reporting
unit to all of the assets and  liabilities of that unit as if that unit had been
acquired  in a  business  combination  and the  fair  value  of the unit was the
purchase  price  if the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the
fair value of the identifiable  assets and liabilities is less than the carrying
value  of the  units  goodwill  an  impairment  charge  is  recorded  for  the
difference

     similarly  the impairment evaluation for indefinite life intangible assets
includes a comparison of the assets  carrying  value to the assets fair value
when the carrying value exceeds fair value an impairment  charge is recorded for
the amount of the  difference  an  intangible  asset is  determined  to have an
indefinite  useful  life  when  there  are no  legal  regulatory  contractual
competitive  economic or any other factors that may limit the period over which
the asset is expected to  contribute  directly or  indirectly to the future cash
flows of our company  in each reporting  period we also evaluate the remaining
useful life of an  intangible  asset that is not being  amortized  to  determine
whether events and circumstances  continue to support an indefinite useful life
if an  intangible  asset that is not being  amortized  is  determined  to have a
finite useful life the asset will be amortized prospectively over the estimated
remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as intangible  assets
subject to amortization

     we tested goodwill for impairment using the process  prescribed in sfas no
142 the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step
measures the amount of the  impairment  if any no impairment  charge  resulted
from the impairment  tests  for comparative  purposes that depict the effect of
adopting sfas no 141 and 142 above we have included the pro forma adjusted net
income per share excluding  amortization of goodwill  distribution channel and
assembled workforce


accounting  for  the  longlived   assets  including   intangibles   subject  to
amortization

     we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 144 accounting
for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets at the beginning of fiscal
2002  the effect of  adopting  sfas 144 did not have a  material  impact on our
financial position or results of operations

     depreciation  and  amortization of our longlived  assets is provided using
accelerated and straightline methods over their estimated useful lives changes
in  circumstances  such as the  passage of new laws or  changes in  regulations
technological advances changes to our business model or changes in the capital
strategy  could  result  in the  actual  useful  lives  differing  from  initial
estimates  in  those  cases  where  we  determine  that  the  useful  life of a
longlived  asset should be revised  we will  depreciate  the net book value in
excess of the estimated  residual value over its revised  remaining useful life
factors  such as changes in the planned use of  equipment  customer  attrition
contractual  amendments  or mandated  regulatory  requirements  could result in
shortened useful lives

     longlived  assets and asset groups are evaluated for  impairment  whenever
events or changes in  circumstances  indicate  that the carrying  amount of such
assets may not be recoverable  the estimated  future cash flows are based upon
among other things  assumptions about expected future operating performance and
may differ from actual cash flows  longlived  assets  evaluated for impairment
are grouped with other assets to the lowest  level for which  identifiable  cash
flows are largely  independent  of the cash flows of other  groups of assets and
liabilities  if the sum of the  projected  undiscounted  cash flows  excluding
interest  is less than the  carrying  value of the  assets  the assets will be
written  down  to  the  estimated   fair  value  in  the  period  in  which  the
determination is made

warranties

     we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue
is  recognized  while we engage  in  extensive  product  quality  programs  and
processes  including  actively  monitoring  and  evaluating  the quality of our
component  suppliers  our warranty  obligation  is affected by product  failure
rates  material  usage  and service  delivery  costs  incurred in correcting a
product failure should actual product failure rates material usage or service
delivery  costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated  warranty
accrual and related costs may be required


stock compensation

     as  permitted  by the  provisions  of  statement  of  financial  accounting
standards sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased  compensation  transition
and  disclosure and statement of financial  accounting  standards sfas 123
no  123  accounting  for  stockbased   compensation  we  apply  accounting
principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees apb
25 and related  interpretations  in  accounting  for our stock option plans and
stock  purchase plan  accordingly  we do not recognize  compensation  cost for
stock  options  granted at a price  equal to fair market  value  note 14 of the
notes to the consolidated  financial  statements describes the plans we operate
and note 1 of the notes to the  consolidated  financial  statements  contains  a
summary of the pro forma  effects to  reported  net income  loss and  earnings
loss  per  share for  fiscal  2002  2001  and 2000 as if we had  elected  to
recognize  compensation  cost based on the fair value of the options  granted at
grant date as prescribed by sfas no 123


investment in the caterpillar  trimble control  technologies llc ctct or joint
venture

     we have adopted the equity method of accounting  for our  investment in the
joint  venture  this  requires  that we record  our share of the joint  venture
profits or losses in a given fiscal  period  during fiscal year 2002 the joint
venture  reported  a loss of 04  million  of which our share is 02  million
which was recorded as a nonoperating  expense under the heading of expense for
affiliated  operations  net but which was  offset by the  amortization  of an
equal  amount of the original  deferred  gain on the sale of  technology  to the
joint venture

     we have  elected  to treat  the cash  distribution  of 110  million  as a
deferred gain being amortized to the extent that losses are  attributable  from
the joint venture under the equity method described above when and if the joint
venture is profitable on a sustainable basis and future operating losses are not
anticipated then we will recognize as a gain the portion of the 110 million
which is  unamortized  to the extent that it is possible that we will have any
futurefunding  obligation  relating  to the joint  venture  then the  relevant
amount of the 110  million  will be  deferred  until  such time  the  funding
obligation no longer exists both our share of profits losses under the equity
method and the  amortization  of our 110  million  deferred  gain are recorded
under the heading of expense for affiliated  operations  net in nonoperating
income expense

results of continuing operations

     our annual  revenues  from  continuing  operations  decreased  from  4753
million in fiscal 2001 to 4666  million in fiscal 2002  in fiscal  2001  our
annual  revenues from  continuing  operations  increased to 4753  million from
3698 million in fiscal 2000 in fiscal 2002 we had net income from continuing
operations of 103 million or 036 diluted earnings per share  compared to a
net loss of 235  million  or 095 loss per share  in fiscal 2001 and a net
income from continuing  operations of 142 million  or 055 diluted  earnings
per share  in fiscal  2000  the total net income  for fiscal  2002  including
discontinued operations was 103 million or 036 diluted earnings per share
compared  to a total net loss for 2001  including  discontinued  operations  of
229 million  or 093 loss per share and a total net income for fiscal 2000
including  discontinued  operations of 142 million  or 055 diluted earnings
per share a summary of financial data by business segment is as follows

     the following  table shows revenue and operating  income by segment for the
periods  indicated  and  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  narrative
descriptions below  operating income by segment excludes unallocated  corporate
expenses  which are comprised  primarily of general and  administrative  costs
amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles as well as other items
not controlled by the business segment

     in the  first  fiscal  quarter  of fiscal  2002  we  realigned  two of our
reportable segments and therefore the following table shows restated revenue and
operating income by segment to reflect this realignment the agriculture segment
was combined with the mapping and gis business to form field solutions  mapping
and  gis  were  previously  part of  fleet  and  asset  management  the  mobile
positioning  business that was part of fleet and asset  management is now mobile
solutions

     we began  breaking  out mobile  solutions as a separate  reporting  segment
during the first quarter of 2002 to address the growing importance of the mobile
asset management business and its impact on our profitability at the same time
we combined our gis and  agriculture  businesses to create a new segment  called
field  solutions  in  order to  recognize  the  synergies  and  similar  product
requirements between the two businesses

basis of presentation

     we have a 5253 week fiscal year  ending on the friday nearest to december
31  which for fiscal 2002 was january 3 2003  fiscal 2002 was a 53week  year
and as a result  we  recorded  an extra week of  revenues  costs  and related
financial activities

     therefore  the  financial  results of fiscal  year 2002  having the extra
week will not be exactly  comparable to the prior and subsequent 52week fiscal
years  thus  due to the inherent  nature of adopting a 5253 week fiscal year
trimble  analysts  shareholders  investors  and  others  will  have  to  make
appropriate  adjustments to any analysis performed when comparing our activities
and results in fiscal  years that  contain 53 weeks  to those that  contain the
standard 52 weeks fiscal years 2001 and 2000 were both comprised of 52weeks


revenue

     in fiscal 2002  total revenue  decreased by 87 million or 18 to 4666
million  from 4753  million in fiscal  2001  the  decrease in fiscal 2002 was
primarily  due to the  reduction of revenue in mobile  solutions  and  portfolio
technologies  total revenue in fiscal 2001 increased by 1055 million or 285
to 4753  million  from 3698  million in fiscal  2000  primarily  due to the
fullyear revenue effect of the spectra precision group acquired in july 2000

fiscal 2002 over fiscal 2001 due to the following factors

o    higher gross margins  resulting from higher revenues and favorable  product
     mix

o    this increase was partially offset by higher operating expenses primarily
     in research  development and marketing

     development


portfolio technologies


revenue

     portfolio technologies revenues decreased by 53 million or 17  in fiscal
2002 over fiscal 2001 due to the following

o    reduction of 44 million due to the sale of our air transport product line
     to honeywell in fiscal 2001

o    revenues from the military business declined by 11 million


     portfolio technologies revenues increased by 77 million or 33 in fiscal
2001 over fiscal 2000 due to the following

     the purchase of tripod data systems as compared to one and onehalf  months
     in fiscal 2000  which  accounted  for an increase of  approximately  122
     million

o    the above increase was partially offset by a 45 million  reduction in our
     commercial  aviation  product line during fiscal 2001  the sale of the air
     transport product line to honeywell was completed in march 2001


operating income

     portfolio technologies operating income increased by 1 million or 26 in
fiscal 2002 over fiscal 2001 due to the following

o    increased operating performance from tripod data systems business


     portfolio technologies operating income increased by 31 million or 318
in fiscal 2001 over fiscal 2000 primarily due to the following

o    an incremental  increase  resulting from a full years operating  results of
     tripod data systems acquired on november 14 2000

international revenues

     sales  to  unaffiliated  customers  outside  the  united  states  comprised
approximately  49 in 2002 50 in 2001 and 52 in 2000 during the 2002 fiscal
year  north and south  america  represented  55  europe  the middle east and
africa  represented  32 and asia  represented  13 in fiscal 2002 the united
states  comprised  approximately  51 and germany  16 of sales to  unaffiliated
customers  we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to
account  for a  significant  portion of our  revenue  for this  reason  we are
subject to the risks  inherent  in these  foreign  sales  including  unexpected
changes in  regulatory  requirements  exchange  rates  governmental  approval
tariffs or other barriers  even though the us government  announced on march
29 1996  that it supports and  maintains  the gps system  and on may 1 2000
stated that it has no intent to ever again use  selective  availability  sa a
method of degrading  gps accuracy  there may be  reluctance in certain  foreign
markets  to  purchase  such  products  given  the  control  of gps  by the  us
government  our results of  operations  could be adversely  affected if we were
unable to continue to generate significant sales in locations outside the us

     no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues in
fiscal 2002 2001 and 2000 it is possible however that in future periods the
failure of one or more large customers to purchase products in quantities
anticipated by us may adversely affect the results of operations


gross margin

     gross  margin  varies due to a number of  factors  including  product  mix
international  sales mix  customer type the effects of production  volumes and
fixed manufacturing costs on unit product costs and new product startup costs
gross  margin as a  percentage  of total  revenues  was 502 in fiscal 2002 and
499 in fiscal 2001 the slight increase in gross margin  percentage for fiscal
2002 compared with fiscal 2001 was due partially to approximately 33 million
of  additional  charges  associated  with the  writedown of excess and obsolete
inventory in fiscal 2001 related to the  rationalization  and simplification of
product  lines  and partially due to  inventories  in excess of our  forecasted
12month demand

     because of  potential  product  mix changes  within and among the  industry
markets  market  pressures  on  unit  selling  prices   fluctuations  in  unit
manufacturing costs  including increases in component prices and other factors
current level gross margins  cannot be assured  in addition  should the global
economic conditions deteriorate further gross margin could be further adversely
impacted

research and development

     research and development  spending  decreased by 16 million during fiscal
2002 and  represented  13 of  revenue  consistent  with 13 in fiscal 2001 due
primarily to

o    the transfer of employeerelated expenses to the caterpillar joint venture
     of approximately 28 million partially offset by an increase in
     engineering expenses associated with the introduction of new products


     research and development  spending increased by 164 million during fiscal
2001 and  represented  13 of revenue  consistent  with 13 in fiscal 2000 due
primarily to the following

o    in fiscal 2001 we experienced a full year of operations of the spectra
     precision group compared with half a year in fiscal 2000 which accounted
     for approximately 117 million of the increase

o    the increase was also due to approximately 50 million related to a full
     year of operations of tripod data systems in fiscal 2001 compared with one
     and onehalf months for fiscal 2000 as well as the inclusion of grid data
     for approximately nine months in fiscal 2001

      we believe that the development and introduction of new products are
critical to the companys future success and expects to continue its active
development of new products


sales and marketing

     sales and marketing expense decreased by 144 million in fiscal 2002 and
represents 19 of revenue compared with 22 in fiscal 2001 due primarily to the
following

o    during fiscal 2001 we sold off many of our direct sales offices which
     decreased sales and marketing expenses by approximately 70 million for
     fiscal 2002

o    a decrease in overall compensation travel advertising promotional and
     trade show expenses of approximately 74 million for fiscal 2002 compared
     to the corresponding period in fiscal 2001


     sales and marketing  expense  increased by 239 million in fiscal 2001 and
represents 22 of revenue  consistent  with 22 in fiscal 2000 primarily due to
the following

o    inclusion of a full year of operations of the spectra precision group as
     compared with half a year in fiscal 2000 which accounted for approximately
     231 million of the increase


      our  future  growth  will  depend in part on the timely  development  and
continued  viability of the markets in which we currently compete as well as our
ability to continue to identify and exploit new markets for our products


general and administrative

     general and administrative expense increased by 32 million in fiscal 2002
representing 9 of revenue compared with 8 in fiscal 2001 primarily due to the
following

o    increase  in bad debt  provisions  related  to  customers  in an  uncertain
     economic environment

o    bad debt expenses for accounts written off during the year due to customer
     defaults


     general and administrative expense increased by 69 million in fiscal 2001
representing 8 of revenue consistent with 8 in fiscal 2000 due primarily to
the following

o    in fiscal 2001 we experienced a full year of operations of the spectra
     precision group as compared with half a year in fiscal 2000 which
     accounted for approximately 56 million of the increase

o    the increase was also due to approximately 09 million related to a full
     year of operations of tripod data systems in fiscal 2001 as compared with
     one and onehalf months for fiscal 2000


restructuring charges

     restructuring charges of 11 million were recorded in fiscal 2002 and 36
million were  recorded in fiscal 2001  which related to severance  costs  as a
result of these  actions  our  headcount  decreased in fiscal 2002 by 49 and in
fiscal 2001 by 207 individuals  as of january 3 2003 all of the restructuring
charges have been paid

     we adopted  sfas no 142 on january 1 2002  as a result  goodwill  is no
longer amortized and intangible assets with indefinite lives with net book value
of 736 million were reclassified to goodwill

     amortization expense of goodwill purchased and other intangibles decreased
in fiscal  2002 by  approximately  211  million  representing  2 of  revenue
compared with 6 in fiscal 2001  the decrease was primarily due to the adoption
of fas 142 that does not require the  amortization  of goodwill  and  intangible
assets with indefinite lives

     amortization expense of goodwill and other purchased  intangibles increased
in fiscal  2001 by  approximately  160  million  representing  6 of  revenue
compared  with  4 in  fiscal  2000  the  increase  was  primarily  due  to the
acquisition  of the spectra  precision  group in july 2000  which resulted in a
year  overyear  increase  of  approximately  150  million  in  goodwill  and
intangibles amortization

     nonoperating expense net decreased by 18 million during fiscal 2002 as
compared with fiscal 2001 the primary reasons for the decrease were as follows

o    decrease in net interest expense of 71 million due to significant
     repayment of debt balances during the year of approximately 52 million
     combined with the effect of lower interest rates

o    this was partially offset by expenses recorded for affiliated operations of
     40 million as a result of transfer pricing effects on transactions
     between trimble and ctct an increase in foreign exchange loss of 06
     million and a writedown of minority investment of 15 million


     nonoperating expense net increased by 113 million during fiscal 2001 as
compared with fiscal 2000 the primary reasons for the increase were as follows

o    increase in interest expenses related to loans and credit facilities
     incurred primarily to finance the acquisition of the spectra precision
     group accounted for approximately 78 million

o    decreased interest income resulting from the sale and maturities of
     shortterm investments used to finance the acquisition of the spectra
     precision group accounted for approximately 34 million


income tax provision

     our effective income tax rates from continuing  operations for fiscal years
2002 2001 and 2000 were 25 9 and 10  respectively  the fiscal 2002 and
2001  income  tax rates  differ  from the  federal  statutory  rate of 35  due
primarily  to foreign  taxes and the  inability  to realize  the  benefit of net
operating  losses  the fiscal  2000  income  tax rate is less than the  federal
statutory  rate due primarily to the  realization of the benefits from prior net
operating losses and previously reserved deferred tax assets


litigation matters

      in november 2001  qualcomm inc filed a lawsuit  against  trimble in the
superior court of the state of california  the complaint  alleges claims for an
unspecified amount of money damages arising out of qualcomms  perceived lack of
assurances  in early 1999 that our  products  purchased  by qualcomm  would work
properly after a scheduled week number  rollover event that took place in august
of 1999  qualcomm is the only  customer to make a claim against us based on the
week number rollover  event  in our opinion  the resolution of this lawsuit is
not  expected  to  have a  material  adverse  effect  on our  overall  financial
position

      we are also a party to other  disputes  incidental  to our  business  we
believe that our ultimate liability as a result of such disputes  if any would
not be material to our overall  financial  position  results of operations  or
liquidity


offbalance sheet financings and liabilities

     other than lease commitments incurred in the normal course of business  we
do not have any offbalance sheet financing  arrangements or liabilities  we do

     in fiscal  2002  our cash and cash  equivalents  decreased by 24 million
from fiscal 2001  we repaid  521  million of our debt  outstanding  this was
financed by the issuance of common stock of approximately 214 million and cash
generated from operating activities of approximately 351 million we also used
approximately 72 million for capital expenditures

     at january 3 2003 our debt mainly consisted of 676 million  outstanding
under senior secured credit facilities  and 691 million outstanding under the
subordinated promissory note related to the acquisition of the spectra precision
group we have relied primarily on cash provided by operating activities to fund
capital expenditures and other investing activities

     on march 20 2002  we used 214  million of net proceeds from our private
placement to retire accrued interest and principal under our  subordinated  note
with   spectraphysics   holdings   inc  a  subsidiary  of  thermo   electron
corporation  reducing the  outstanding  principal  amount to 687 million  in
addition  we renegotiated the terms of the subordinated note under the revised
agreement  the  maturity of the note was extended  until july 14 2004  at the
current  interest rate of  approximately  104 per year in connection with the
amendment  on march 20 2002 we agreed to issue to thermo  electron a fiveyear
warrant to purchase  200000  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of
1511  under the fiveyear  warrant  the total number of warrants issued will
not exceed  376233  shares  on a  quarterly  basis  beginning  july 14  2002
spectraphysics  warrant  became  exercisable  for an additional  250 shares of
common stock for every 1 million of principal  and interest  outstanding  until
the note is paid off in full  these shares are  purchasable at a price equal to
the average of our stocks closing price for the five days immediately preceding
the last  trading day of each  quarter  on july 14 2002 an  additional  17364
shares became  exercisable at an exercise price of 1446 per share  on october
14 2002 an additional 17824 shares became  exercisable at an exercise price of
918 on january 14 2003 an additional 18284 shares became  exercisable at an
exercise price of 1354  these additional shares are exercisable over a 5year
period  the  approximate  fair  value  of the  warrants  of  15  million  was
determined using the blackscholes pricing model with the following assumptions
contractual life of 5year period  riskfree interest rate of 4 volatility of
65 and no dividends during the contractual  term the value of the warrants is
amortized to interest expense over the term of the subordinated note

      in fiscal 2002 cash provided by operating  activities was 351 million
as compared to 251  million in fiscal  2001  the  increase of 10 million was
primarily  due to a onetime  special  cash  distribution  of 11  million  from
caterpillar trimble control technologies upon its formation in the first quarter
of fiscal 2002  trimbles  ability to continue to generate cash from operations
will  depend in large part on  revenues  the rate of  collections  of  accounts
receivable and profitability  both the inventory turns and accounts receivable
days sales  outstanding  metrics  were  similar at the end of fiscal 2002 to the
fiscal 2001 level

     cash flows used in investing activities were 58 million in fiscal 2002 as
compared to 114 million in fiscal 2001  mostly due to  investment  activities
associated  with the  acquisition of an additional 25 percent equity interest in
terrasat  a german  corporation  and the acquisition in property and equipment
partially  offset by cash acquired through  levelite  acquisition  cash used in
investing  activities  in fiscal 2001  included  amounts  paid for the grid data
acquisition

     cash used in financing  activities  was 317  million in fiscal  2002  as
compared to 235  million in fiscal 2001  during  fiscal  2002  we made 521
million of payments against our debt outstanding  these payments were offset by
proceeds  from the issuance of common  stock to employees  pursuant to our stock
option  plan  and  employee  stock  purchase  plan of 41  million  as well as
issuance of common stock under a private equity placement of 17 million

     in july 2000 we obtained 200 million of senior secured credit facilities
the credit  facilities  from a syndicate of banks to support our acquisition
of  the  spectra   precision  group  the  companys   ongoing  working  capital
requirements  and to refinance  certain existing debt see note 10 of the notes
to  the  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  the  credit  facilities
consisted  of 100 million  available as a term loan and 100 million  available
under two  revolvers  on january  14  2003  trimble  executed  an amended and
restated credit  agreement  which  restructured  the 100 million revolver into
four tranches  tranches a and c belong to the 50 million us  dollar revolver
and  tranches  b and d  belong  to  the  50  million  multicurrency  revolver
allocated to tranche a is 12500000  with an expiration  date of july 14 2003
and allocated to tranche c is  37500000  with an expiration  date of april 7
2004  allocated to tranche b is 1500000  with an expiration date of july 14
2003 and allocated to tranche d is 48500000  with an expiration date of april
7 2004 as a result  the 100 million  revolver will remain in effect  through
july 14  2003 and be reduced to 86 million  for the period  starting  july 15
2003 through april 7 2004 as of january 3 2003 outstanding balance under the
revolver was 35 million and under the term loan was 326 million

     the credit  facilities  are secured by all material  assets of our company
except for assets  that are  subject to foreign  tax  considerations  financial
covenants of the credit facilities  include leverage  fixed charge and minimum
net worth tests and all were amended during the third quarter of fiscal 2002 at
january 3 2003  and as of the date of this report  we are in compliance  with
debt  covenants  the amounts due under the revolver loans are paid as the loans
mature  and the loan commitment fees are paid on a quarterly  basis  under the
fiveyear term loan portion of the credit facility  we are due to make payments
excluding  interest  of  approximately  24  million  in  fiscal  2003 and the
remaining 86 million in fiscal 2004

      we believe that our cash and cash  equivalents  together with our credit
facilities  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for
at least the next twelve  months  at january 3 2003  we had 287  million of
cash and cash  equivalents  as well as access to 65  million of cash under the
terms of our revolver loans

     under the terms of the credit facilities  we are currently restricted from
paying  dividends  and are limited as to the amount of our common  stock that we
can  repurchase  we are allowed to pay dividends and  repurchase  shares of our
common  stock up to 25 of net  income  in the  previous  fiscal  year  we have
obligations under noncancelable operating leases for our office facilities see
note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  in fiscal 2003
the  payments  under these  noncancelable  operating  leases are expected to be
approximately 121 million

      we expect fiscal 2003 capital expenditures to be approximately 8 million
to 11  million  primarily  for computer  equipment  software  and  leasehold
improvements  associated with business expansion  decisions related to how much
cash is used for investing are  influenced by the expected  amount of cash to be
provided by operations

interest

new accounting standards

     we adopted statement of financial  accounting  standards  sfas no 141
business  combinations  and sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets
at the beginning of fiscal 2002 application of the nonamortization  provisions
of  sfas  no  142  significantly  reduced  amortization  expense  of  purchased
intangibles and goodwill to approximately  83 million for the fiscal year 2002
from 294 million in the prior year we  reclassified  identifiable  intangible
assets with indefinite lives with net book value of 736 million as defined by
sfas no  142  to  goodwill at the date of  adoption  we tested  goodwill  for
impairment using the twostep process prescribed in sfas no 142 the first step
is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount
of the  impairment  if any no impairment  charge  resulted from the impairment
tests


     in  october of 2001  the fasb  issued  sfas  no144  accounting  for the
impairment or disposal of longlived  assets which amends accounting  guidance
on asset impairment and provides a single accounting model for longlived assets
to be disposed of among other provisions the new rules change the criteria for
classifying an asset as  heldforsale  the standard also broadens the scope of
businesses  to be  disposed  of  that  qualify  for  reporting  as  discontinued
operations  and changes the timing of recognizing losses on such operations we
adopted sfas no 144 at the  beginning  of fiscal  2002  the effect of adopting
sfas no 144 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results
of operations


     in july of 2002  the fasb  issued  sfas no  146  accounting  for  costs
associated  with  exit or  disposal  activities  sfas no  146  addresses  the
financial  accounting  and reporting  for  obligations  associated  with an exit
activity including restructuring or with a disposal of longlived assets exit
activities  include  but are not limited to  eliminating  or reducing  product
lines  terminating employees and contracts  and relocating plant facilities or
personnel  sfas no 146 specifies  that a company will record a liability for a
cost  associated  with an exit or disposal  activity only when that liability is
incurred  and can be measured at fair value  therefore  commitment  to an exit
plan or a plan of disposal  expresses  only our  intended  future  actions  and
therefore  does not meet the  requirement  for  recognizing a liability and the
related expense  sfas no 146 is effective  prospectively  for exit or disposal
activities  initiated after december 31 2002 with earlier adoption encouraged
we do not  anticipate  that the  adoption  of sfas no  146 will have a material
effect on our financial position or results of operations

     in november of 2002  the fasb issued fasb  interpretation  fin no 45
guarantors  accounting and disclosure  requirements for guarantees  including
indirect  guarantees  of  indebtedness  of others  fin no 45 requires  that a
liability  be  recorded  in the  guarantors  balance  sheet upon  issuance of a
guarantee  in addition  fin no 45 requires  disclosures  about the guarantees
that an entity has issued  including a  rollforward  of the  entitys  product
warranty  liabilities  we will apply the  recognition  provisions of fin no 45
prospectively to guarantees issued after december 31 2002

     while we  engage  in  extensive  product  quality  programs  and  processes
including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers
our warranty  obligation is affected by product  failure rates  material usage
and service  delivery  costs  incurred in correcting a product  failure  should
actual product failure rates  material usage or service  delivery costs differ
from the  estimates  revisions to the  estimated  warranty  accrual and related
costs may be required

     changes in our product warranty liability during the 12 months ended
january 3 2003 are as follows

into  in  fiscal  periods  beginning  after  june  15  2003  we are  currently
evaluating the effect that the adoption of eitf issue no 0021 will have on our
results of operations and financial condition

     in december of 2002 fasb issued fasb no 148  accounting for stockbased
compensation   transition  and  disclosure  sfas no 148 amends fasb no 123
accounting for stockbased  compensation  to provide  alternative  methods of
transition for an entity that changes to the fair value method of accounting for
stockbased  employee  compensation  in  addition  sfas  no  148  amends  the
disclosure  provisions  of sfas no 123 to require  expanded and more  prominent
disclosure  of the effects of an  entitys  accounting  policy  with  respect to
stockbased employee compensation this disclosure is required in the summary of
significant accounting policies footnote or its equivalent in annual and interim
financial  statements  sfas no  148 does not  amend  sfas no  123 to  require
companies to account for their stockbased  employee awards using the fair value
method  as  discussed  in note 1 of the  notes  to the  consolidated  financial
statements  for purposes of pro forma  disclosures  we amortized the estimated
fair value of the options to expense over the options  vesting period  and the
estimated  fair value of purchases  under the employee  stock  purchase  plan is
expensed  in  the  year  of  purchase  as  well  as  the  stockbased   employee
compensation cost net of related tax effects  that would have been included in
the  determination of net income if the fair value based method had been applied
to all awards  the effects on pro forma disclosure of applying sfas no 123 are
not likely to be representative of the effects on pro forma disclosure of future
years

     in january of 2003 the fasb issued fin no 46  consolidation of variable
interest  entities  fin no  46  requires  a  variable  interest  entity to be
consolidated  by a company if that  company is subject to a majority of the risk
of loss from the variable interest entitys  activities or entitled to receive a
majority  of  the  entitys   residual   returns  or  both  the   consolidation
requirements  of fin no 46 apply  immediately  to  variable  interest  entities
created after january 31 2003 the  consolidation  requirements  apply to older
entities in the first  fiscal year or interim  period  beginning  after june 15
2003 we are currently  evaluating the provisions of fin no 46 however  we do
not believe as of january 3 2003  the company has any  investments in variable
interest entities



risks and uncertainties

our inability to accurately predict orders and shipments may affect our revenue
expenses and earnings per share

     we  have  not  been  able in the  past to  consistently  predict  when  our
customers  will place  orders and request  shipments  so that we cannot  always
accurately  plan our  manufacturing  requirements  as a result  if orders  and
shipments  differ from what we predict  we may incur  additional  expenses  and
build excess inventory  which may require additional accruals  any significant
change in our  customers  purchasing  patterns  could have a  material  adverse
effect on our operating results and reported earnings per share for a particular
quarter


     our  operating   results  in  each  quarter  may  be  affected  by  special
conditions  such as seasonality  late quarter  purchases  and other potential
issues

     due in part to the buying patterns of our customers a significant
portion of our quarterly revenues occurs from orders received and immediately
shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of each quarter although
our operating expenses tend to remain fairly predictable engineering and
construction purchases tend to occur in early spring and governmental agencies
tend to utilize funds available at the end of the governments fiscal year for
additional purchases at the end of our third fiscal quarter in september of each
year concentrations of orders sometimes also occur at the end of our other two
fiscal quarters additionally a majority of our sales force earns commissions
on a quarterly basis which may cause concentrations of orders at the end of any
fiscal quarter if for any reason expected sales are deferred orders are not
received or shipments are delayed a few days at the end of a quarter our
operating results and reported earnings per share for that quarter could be
significantly impacted


we are dependent on a sole manufacturer and assembler for many of our products
and on sole suppliers of critical parts for our products

     since august 1999 we have been substantially dependent upon solectron
corporation as the exclusive manufacturing partner for many of our gps products
previously manufactured out of our sunnyvale facilities under the agreement
with solectron we provide to solectron a twelvemonth product forecast and
place purchase orders with solectron sixty calendar days in advance of the
scheduled delivery of products to our customers although purchase orders placed
with solectron are cancelable the terms of the agreement would require us to
purchase from solectron all material inventory not returnable or usable by other
solectron customers accordingly if we inaccurately forecast demand for our
products we may be unable to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity from
solectron to meet customers delivery requirements or we may accumulate excess
inventories if such inventories are not usable by other solectron customers

         our current contract with solectron expires in august of 2003

     during the fourth quarter of 2002  solectron began  assembling some of our
component technology products in china although we believe that this initiative
in china  will bring  significant  cost  savings  we cannot  predict  potential
effects that may result from this program

     in  addition  we rely on  sole  suppliers  for a  number  of our  critical
components  we have  experienced  shortages of  components  in the past  as an
example  we were  affected by the  inability  of a display  supplier to provide
adequate  quantities  to meet our  requirements  in the  third  fiscal  calendar
quarter of 2002 that resulted in the deferral of 24 million in orders into the
fourth  quarter of 2002  our  current  reliance  on sole or a limited  group of
suppliers involves several risks  including a potential  inability to obtain an
adequate  supply of required  components and reduced  control over pricing  any
inability to obtain  adequate  deliveries or any other  circumstance  that would
require  us to  seek  alternative  sources  of  supply  or to  manufacture  such
components  internally  could  significantly  delay  our  ability  to  ship  our
products   which  could  damage  relationships  with  current  and  prospective
customers and could harm our reputation  and brand  which could have a material
adverse effect on our business


our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate

     our operating results have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to
fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number
of factors many of which are beyond our control results in any period could be
affected by

o    changes in market demand

o    competitive market conditions

o    market  acceptance  of existing or new  products  especially in our mobile
     solutions business

o    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

o    the cost and availability of components

o    our ability to manufacture and ship products

o    the mix of our customer base and sales channels

o    the mix of products sold

o    our ability to expand our sales and marketing organization effectively

o    our ability to attract and retain key technical and managerial employees

o    the timing of shipments of products  under  contracts and sale of licensing
     rights and

o    general global economic conditions


     in addition demand for our products in any quarter or year may vary due to
the  seasonal  buying  patterns  of  our  customers  in  the   agricultural  and
engineering  and  construction  industries  due to the foregoing  factors  our
operating  results in one or more future  periods are  expected to be subject to
significant   fluctuations   the  price  of  our  common  stock  could  decline
substantially in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance
being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  which are
based  primarily  on  historical  models  that  are  not  necessarily   accurate
representations of the future


our gross margin is subject to fluctuation

     our gross margin is affected by a number of factors including product mix
product  pricing  cost of  components  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  and
manufacturing  costs for example  since our engineering and construction ec
and geographic  information  systems gis products  generally have higher gross
margins than our component  technologies ct products  absent other factors a
shift  in  sales  toward  ec  and gis  products  would  lead to a gross  margin
improvement  on the other hand if market conditions in the highly  competitive
ec and gis market  segments  forced us to lower unit prices  we would suffer a
decline in gross margin unless we were able to timely offset the price reduction
by a reduction in  production  costs or by sales of other  products  with higher
gross margins  a decline in gross margin could  negatively  impact our earnings
per share


our  business  is  subject to  disruptions  and  uncertainties  caused by war or
terrorism

     acts of war or acts of terrorism  could have a material  adverse  impact on
our  business  operating  results  and  financial  condition  the  threat  of
terrorism and war and heightened  security and military response to this threat
or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruption to our economy and
create  further   uncertainties   to  the  extent  that  such   disruptions  or
uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of orders or the manufacture or
shipment  of our  products  our  business  operating  results  and  financial
condition could be materially and adversely affected


our  substantial  indebtedness  could  materially  restrict our  operations  and
adversely affect our financial condition

     we now have and for the  foreseeable  future expect to have a significant
level of indebtedness our substantial indebtedness could

o    increase  our  vulnerability  to  general  adverse  economic  and  industry
     conditions

o    limit our ability to fund future working capital capital expenditures
     research and development and other general corporate requirements or to
     make certain investments that could benefit us

o    require us to  dedicate a  substantial  portion of our cash flow to service
     interest and  principal  payments on our debt

o    limit our  flexibility to react to changes in our business and the industry
     in which we operate and

o    limit our ability to borrow additional funds


our credit agreement contains stringent financial covenants

     two of the  financial  covenants in our credit  agreement  with the bank of
nova scotia and certain other banks dated july 14 2000 as amended the credit
agreement  minimum  fixed charge  coverage and maximum  leverage  ratio  are
extremely sensitive to changes in earnings before interest  taxes depreciation
and amortization  ebitda  in turn  ebitda is highly correlated to revenues
and costs  due to  uncertainties  associated with the downturn in the worldwide
economy  our future  revenues by quarter are more  difficult to forecast and we
have put in place various cost cutting measures  including the consolidation of
service  functions  and centers  offices  and of redundant  product  lines and
reductions in staff  if revenues  should decline at a faster pace than the rate
of these cost cutting measures  on a quartertoquarter  basis we may not be in
compliance with the two abovementioned  financial  covenants  if we default on
one or more  covenants  we will have to obtain  either  negotiated  waivers  or
amendments to the credit agreement  if we were unable to obtain such waivers or
amendments  the banks  would have the right to  accelerate  the  payment of our
outstanding obligations under the credit agreement  which would have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and viability as an operating company
in addition  a default under one of our debt instruments may also trigger cross
defaults  under our other debt  instruments  an event of default under any debt
instrument  if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on us
in september of 2002 we reached an agreement to ease our financial  covenants
these revised  covenants  will remain in effect  through the term of the current
credit facility  on january 14 2003  trimble executed an amended and restated
credit  agreement  which  restructured  the 100  million  revolver  into  four
tranches  tranches  a  c belong  to the 50  million  us dollar  revolver  and
tranches b  d belong to the 50 million multicurrency  revolver  allocated to
tranche a is 12500000  with an expiration date of july 14 2003 and allocated
to tranche c is 37500000 with an expiration date of april 07 2004 allocated
to  tranche  b is  1500000  with an  expiration  date of july  14  2003  and
allocated to tranche d is 48500000 with an expiration date of april 07 2004
as a result  the 100 million  revolver will remain in effect  through july 14
2003 and be reduced to 86 million for the period starting july 15 2003 through
april 7 2004


we are dependent on key customers

     an  increasing  amount of our  revenue is  generated  from  large  original
equipment  manufacturers  such as siemens vdo automotive  ag nortel  mcneilus
caterpillar  cnh global  dewalt hilti and blaupunkt  a reduction or loss of
business  with  these  customers  could have a  material  adverse  effect on our
financial condition and results of operations there can be no assurance that we
will be able to  continue  to  realize  value from  these  relationships  in the
future


we are dependent on new products

     our future revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to bring
new products to market on a timely basis  we must continue to make  significant
investments  in  research  and  development  in order to continue to develop new
products  enhance  existing  products  and achieve  market  acceptance  of such
products  we may incur problems in the future in innovating and introducing new
products  our development stage products may not be successfully  completed or
if developed may not achieve significant customer acceptance if we were unable
to successfully  define  develop and introduce  competitive  new products  and
enhance existing  products  our future results of operations would be adversely
affected  development and manufacturing  schedules for technology  products are
difficult to predict and we might not achieve timely initial customer shipments
of new products  the timely  availability of these products in volume and their
acceptance  by customers  are  important to our future  success  a delay in new
product  introductions  could  have  a  significant  impact  on our  results  of
operations


we face risks of entering into and maintaining alliances

     we believe that in certain  emerging markets our success will depend on our
ability to form and maintain  alliances with  established  system  providers and
industry  leaders  our  failure to form and  maintain  such  alliances  or the
preemption  of  such  alliances  by  actions  of  other  competitors  or us will
adversely affect our ability to penetrate emerging markets no assurances can be
given that we will not experience  problems from current or future  alliances or
that we will realize value from any such strategic alliances




we are  dependent  on the  availability  of  allocated  bands  within  the radio
frequency spectrum

     our gps  technology  is dependent  on the use of the  standard  positioning
service sps  provided by the us  governments  global  positioning  system
gps the gps sps operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated
for radio  navigation  satellite  services  international  allocations of radio
frequency  are  made by the  international  telecommunications  union  itu  a
specialized  technical  agency of the  united  nations  these  allocations  are
further  governed by radio  regulations that have treaty status and which may be
subject  to   modification   every  two  to  three  years  by  the  world  radio
communication conference

     any itu  reallocation of radio frequency  bands  including  frequency band
segmentation  or sharing of spectrum  may materially  and adversely  affect the
utility and reliability of our products  which would in turn cause a material
adverse  effect on our operating  results  many of our products use other radio
frequency  bands  together  with  the  gps  signal  to  provide  enhanced  gps
capabilities   such  as  realtime   kinematics   precision   the   continuing
availability of these nongps radio frequencies is essential to provide enhanced
gps products to our precision survey markets any regulatory changes in spectrum
allocation or in allowable  operating  conditions  may  materially and adversely
affect the utility and reliability of our products  which would in turn cause
a material adverse effect on our operating results

     in addition  unwanted  emissions from mobile satellite  services and other
equipment  operating in adjacent  frequency  bands or inband from  licensed and
unlicensed   devices  may  materially  and  adversely  affect  the  utility  and
reliability of our products  which could result in a material adverse effect on
our  operating  results  the  fcc  continually  receives  proposals  for  novel
technologies and services such as ultrawideband  technologies  which may seek
to operate in or across  the radio  frequency  bands currently used by the gps
sps and other public safety services  adverse  decisions by the fcc that result
in harmful interference to the delivery of the gps sps and other radio frequency
spectrum  also used in our  products may  materially  and  adversely  affect the
utility  and  reliability  of our  products  which  could  result in a material
adverse effect on our business and financial condition


we are subject to the adverse impact of radio frequency congestion

     we have  certain  realtime  kinematics  products  such as our land survey
5700 that use integrated  radio  communication  technology  requiring access to
available radio frequencies  allocated by the fcc in addition  access to these
frequencies by state agencies is under management by state radio  communications
coordinators  some  bands  are  experiencing  congestion  that  excludes  their
availability for access by state agencies in some states including the state of
california  an inability to obtain access to these radio frequencies could have
an adverse effect on our operating results


many of our products rely on the gps satellite system

     the gps satellites and their ground support systems are complex  electronic
systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage the
satellites were  originally  designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject
to damage by the hostile space  environment in which they operate  however  of
the current  deployment  of 28  satellites  in place  some have already been in
operation  for 13 years  to repair  damaged  or  malfunctioning  satellites  is
currently not economically  feasible if a significant number of satellites were
to  become  inoperable  there  could be a  substantial  delay  before  they are
replaced with new satellites  a reduction in the number of operating satellites
may impair the  current  utility of the gps system and the growth of current and
additional market opportunities

     in addition there can be no assurance that the us government will remain
committed to the operation and maintenance of gps satellites over a long period
or that the policies of the us  government  for the use of gps without  charge
will remain unchanged however a 1996 presidential decision directive marks the
first time in the  evolution  of gps that access for civilian use free of direct
user fees is specifically  recognized and supported by presidential  policy  in
addition   presidential   policy  has  been   complemented   by   corresponding
legislation signed into law because of everincreasing commercial applications
of gps other us government agencies may become involved in the administration
or the regulation of the use of gps signals  any of the foregoing factors could
affect the  willingness  of buyers of our products to select  gpsbased  systems
instead of products based on competing technologies

     any  resulting  change in  market  demand  for gps  products  could  have a
material  adverse  effect  on  our  financial  results  for  example  european
governments  have  expressed  interest  in  building  an  independent  satellite
navigation system known as galileo depending on the as yet undetermined design
and operation of this system  there may be  interference to the delivery of the
gps sps and may materially and adversely  affect the utility and  reliability of
our products  which could result in a material  adverse  effect on our business
and operating results


we face risks in investing in and integrating new acquisitions

     we are continuously evaluating external investments in technologies related
to our business  and have made relatively small strategic equity investments in
a number of gpsrelated and laserrelated technology companies  acquisitions of
companies divisions of companies or products entail numerous risks including

o    potential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and
     products or to realize cost savings or other anticipated benefits from
     integration

o    diversion of managements attention

o    loss of key employees of acquired operations

o    the  difficulty of  assimilating  geographically  dispersed  operations and
     personnel of the acquired companies

o    the potential disruption of our ongoing business

o    unanticipated expenses related to such integration

o    the correct assessment of the relative percentages of inprocess research
     and development expense that can be immediately written off as compared to
     the amount which must be amortized over the appropriate life of the asset

o    the impairment of  relationships  with employees and customers of either an
     acquired company or our own business

o    the potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired business and

o    inability to recover strategic investments in development stage entities


     as a result of such  acquisitions  we have significant assets that include
goodwill and other purchased intangibles the testing of these intangibles under
established  accounting  guidelines for impairment  requires  significant use of
judgment  and  assumptions   changes  in  business   conditions  could  require
adjustments  to the valuation of these assets  any such problems in integration
or  adjustments  to the  value of the  assets  acquired  could  harm our  growth
strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition
and compliance with debt covenants



we face competition in our markets

     our  markets  are highly  competitive  and we expect  that both  direct and
indirect  competition  will  increase  in the future  our  overall  competitive
position  depends  on a number of  factors  including  the  price  quality  and
performance of our products  the level of customer service  the development of
new technology and our ability to participate in emerging  markets  within each
of our markets  we encounter  direct  competition  from other gps  optical and
laser  suppliers and  competition may intensify from various larger domestic and
international  competitors  and new  market  entrants  some of which may be our
current customers  the competition in the future may in some cases result in
price  reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which could
materially and adversely  affect our business  operating  results and financial
condition  we believe  that our ability to compete  successfully  in the future
against  existing and additional  competitors will depend largely on our ability
to execute our  strategy  to provide  systems and  products  with  significantly
differentiated  features compared to currently available products we may not be
able to  implement  this  strategy  successfully  and our  products  may not be
competitive  with other  technologies  or products  that may be developed by our
competitors  many of whom  have  significantly  greater  financial  technical
manufacturing marketing sales and other resources than we do


we are dependent on proprietary technology

     our  future  success  and  competitive   position  is  dependent  upon  our
proprietary  technology  and we rely on patent  trade  secret  trademark  and
copyright  law to  protect  our  intellectual  property  the  patents  owned or
licensed by us may be  invalidated  circumvented  and  challenged  the rights
granted under these patents may not provide competitive advantages to us any of
our pending or future patent  applications may not be issued within the scope of
the claims sought by us if at all

     others  may  develop  technologies  that are  similar  or  superior  to our
technology  duplicate our  technology or design around the patents owned by us
in addition  effective  copyright  patent and trade secret  protection  may be
unavailable  limited or not applied for in certain foreign countries the steps
taken by us to protect our technology might not prevent the  misappropriation of
such technology

     the value of our products relies  substantially on our technical innovation
in fields in which there are many current patent  filings  we recognize that as
new patents are issued or are  brought to our  attention  by the holders of such
patents it may be necessary for us to withdraw products from the market take a
license from such patent  holders  or redesign our products  we do not believe
any of our products  currently  infringe patents or other proprietary  rights of
third  parties  but we cannot be certain  they do not do so in  addition  the
legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard  intellectual property or
to defend against  litigation could become a significant  expense of operations
such  events  could  have  a  material   adverse   effect  on  our  revenues  or
profitability


we must carefully manage our future growth

     growth in our sales or continued  expansion in the scope of our  operations
could  strain  our  current  management  financial   manufacturing  and  other
resources  and may require us to implement  and improve a variety of  operating
financial  and other  systems  procedures  and controls  specifically  we have
experienced  strain in our financial and order management system as a result of
our acquisitions  we are expanding our sales  accounting  manufacturing  and
other information systems to meet these challenges these systems procedures or
controls may not be adequate to support our  operations and may not be designed
implemented or improved in a cost  effective and timely  manner  any failure to
implement  improve and expand such systems procedures and controls in a timely
and efficient  manner could harm our growth  strategy and  adversely  affect our
financial condition and ability to achieve our business objectives



we are dependent on retaining and  attracting  highly  skilled  development  and
managerial personnel

     our ability to maintain our competitive technological position will depend
in a large  part  on our  ability  to  attract  motivate  and  retain  highly
qualified  development  and  managerial  personnel  competition  for  qualified
employees in our industry and location is intense and there can be no assurance
that we will be able to attract  motivate and retain enough qualified employees
necessary for the future continued development of our business and products


we may encounter problems associated with international operations and sales

     our  customers  are located  throughout  the world  sales to  unaffiliated
customers in foreign locations represented  approximately 49 of our revenues in
our fiscal  year 2002  50 in our fiscal  year 2001 and 52 in our fiscal  year
2000  in addition  we have  significant  international  operations  including
manufacturing facilities  sales personnel and customer support operations  our
international sales organization  contains offices in 21 foreign countries  our
international  manufacturing facilities are in sweden and germany and we have a
regional  fulfillment  center in the  netherlands  our  international  presence
exposes us to risks not faced by wholly  domestic  companies  specifically  we
have experienced issues relating to integration of foreign  operations  greater
difficulty in accounts receivable collection longer payment cycles and currency
fluctuations additionally we face the following risks among others

o    unexpected changes in regulatory requirements

o    tariffs and other trade barriers

o    political legal and economic instability in foreign markets particularly
     in those markets in which we maintain manufacturing and research
     facilities

o    difficulties in staffing and management

o    language and cultural barriers seasonal reductions in business activities
     in the summer months in europe and some other countries

o    war and acts of terrorism and

o    potentially adverse tax consequences


     although we  implemented  a program to attempt to manage  foreign  exchange
risks through hedging and other strategies  there can be no assurance that this
program will be successful and that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not
have a material  adverse  effect on our results of operations  in addition  in
certain foreign markets  there may be reluctance to purchase  products based on
gps technology given the control of gps by the us government


we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates

     a  significant  portion of our  business  is  conducted  outside the united
states and as such we face exposure to adverse movements in nonus  currency
exchange  rates  these  exposures  may change over time as  business  practices
evolve and could have a material  adverse  impact on our  financial  results and
cash flows  compared  to fiscal  2001  in fiscal  2002  the us  currency  has
weakened against other currencies

     currently  we hedge only those currency exposures  associated with certain
assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional  currencies and periodically
will hedge  anticipated  foreign  currency  cash flows  the hedging  activities
undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency  fluctuations  on
certain  nonfunctional  currency assets and  liabilities  our attempts to hedge
against these risks may not be successful  resulting in an adverse impact on our
net income

     the affect of the movement in foreign exchange rates has been reflected in
the cumulative translation adjustment included in the accumulative other
comprehensive loss under shareholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet
statement located in this report


we are subject to the impact of governmental and other similar certifications

     we market  certain  products that are subject to  governmental  and similar
certifications  before  they can be sold  for  example  ce  certification  for
radiated  emissions is required  for most gps  receiver and data  communications
products sold in the european union an inability to obtain such  certifications
in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our operating results  also
our products  that use  integrated  radio  communication  technology  require an
enduser to obtain  licensing from the federal  communications  commission fcc
for  frequencyband  usage  these are  secondary  licenses  that are subject to
certain  restrictions  during the fourth quarter of 1998  the fcc  temporarily
suspended  the  issuance of licenses  for  certain of our  realtime  kinematics
products  because of  interference  with  certain  other users of similar  radio
frequencies  an inability or delay in obtaining such  certifications or changes
to the rules by the fcc could adversely affect our ability to bring our products
to market  which  could  harm our  customer  relationships  and have a material
adverse effect on our business


our stock price may be volatile

     the price of our common stock can be expected to fluctuate substantially as
it has in the past  the price  could react to actual or  anticipated  quarterly
variations in results of operations  announcements of technological innovations
or new  products by us or our  competitors  developments  related to patents or
other  intellectual  property  rights  developments  in our  relationship  with
customers  suppliers  or strategic  partners  and other events or factors  in
addition any shortfall or changes in revenue gross margins earnings or other
financial  results  from  analysts  expectations  could  cause the price of our
common stock to fluctuate significantly additionally macroeconomic factors as
well as market  climate  for the  hightechnology  sector  could also impact the
trading price of our stock




item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk

     we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and
foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments
to manage these risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for
speculative or trading purposes all financial instruments are used in
accordance with policies approved by our board of directors

market interest rate risk

     we are exposed to market risk due to the  possibility of changing  interest
rates under our senior  secured  credit  facilities  our credit  facilities are
comprised  of a  us  dollaronly  revolver  a  multicurrency  revolver  both
expiring  april 7 2004  and a  fiveyear  term loan  expiring  july 14  2004
borrowings under the credit facility have interest  payments based on a floating
rate of libor  plus a number  of basis  points  tied to a  formula  based on our
leverage  ratio  as of  january  3 2003  our  senior  debt to ebitda  senior
leverage  ratio was  approximately  141 at this leverage ratio our pricing on
the credit  facility  is libor plus 125 basis  points  the us  dollar and the
multicurrency  revolvers run through april 2004 and have outstanding  principal
balances at january 3 2003 of 250 million and 100 million respectively as
of january 3 2003 we have borrowed  from the  multicurrency  revolver in us
currency  only  the term loan  expires on july 14 2004 and has an  outstanding
principal  balance of 326 million at january 3 2003  the  threemonth  libor
effective  rate at january 3 2003 was 138  a  hypothetical  10  increase in
threemonth libor rates could result in approximately 93000 annual increase in
interest expense on the existing principal balances

     in addition  we have a 18 million promissory note of which 110000 was
classified as a current liability at the end of fiscal 2002 the note is payable
in monthly installments  bearing a variable interest rate of 54 as of january
3 2003 a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates would not have a material
impact on the results of our operations

      the  hypothetical  changes and  assumptions  made above will be different
from what actually occurs in the future  furthermore  the  computations do not
anticipate  actions that may be taken by our management  should the hypothetical
market changes actually occur over time as a result actual earnings effects in
the future will differ from those quantified above


foreign currency exchange rate risk

     we transact  business in various foreign  currencies and hedges  identified
risks  associated  with foreign  currency  transactions in order to minimize the
impact of changes in foreign  currency  exchange  rates on earnings  we utilize
forward  contracts to hedge  certain  trade and  intercompany  receivables  and
payables  these contracts  reduce the exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate
movements as the gains and losses  associated with foreign currency balances are
generally offset with the gains and losses on the hedge  contracts  these hedge
instruments  are marked to market through  earnings  every period  from time to
time we may also utilize forward foreign exchange contracts  designated as cash
flow hedges of  operational  exposures  represented  by firm  backlog  orders to
specific  accounts over a specific period of time we record changes in the fair
value of cash flow hedges in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income loss
until the firm  backlog  transaction  ships  upon  recognition  of revenue  we
reclassify  the  gain  or  loss on the  cash  flow  hedge  to the  statement  of
operations  for the fiscal  year ended  january 3 2003  we recorded a gain of
57000  reflecting  the net  change and ending  balance in  relation  to a firm
backlog hedge  the critical terms of the cash flow hedging  instruments are the
same as the underlying forecasted transactions the changes in fair value of the
derivatives  are intended to offset  changes in the expected  cash flow from the
forecasted  transactions  all forward  contracts  have maturity of less than 12
months

      we do not  anticipate  any material  adverse  effect on our  consolidated
financial position utilizing our current hedging strategy

general

     trimble  navigation  limited a california  corporation  trimble or the
company  develops  manufactures and distributes innovative products enabled
by  global   positioning   system   gps   optical   laser   and  wireless
communications   technology   we  provide  endusers  and  original   equipment
manufacturers   oems  with  solutions  for  diverse  applications   including
agriculture  engineering and construction  fleet and asset management timing
automobile  navigation  and  military  our principal  products  which utilize
substantial amounts of proprietary software and firmware are integrated systems
for  collecting  analyzing and utilizing  position data in forms  optimized for
specific enduser applications

     in july 2000  trimble  completed the acquisition of spectra  precision  a
wholly owned business the spectra  precision group or spg  formerly owned
by a  subsidiary  of thermo  electron  corporation  this  acquisition  provides
trimble with optical and laser based  positioning  solutions  for two of our key
strategic   markets   and  enhances  the  companys   sales  and   distribution
capabilities

background

     trimble   provides   positioning   solutions   through  three   fundamental
technologies  gps optical and laser precise  determination of locations both
on  and  above  the  earths  surface  is  a  fundamental  requirement  in  many
applications and industries  for example  position data is used for navigation
on land  sea and air  and to  conduct  surveys  draw  maps  and guide  heavy
machinery   position   solutions   are  used  in  many   industries   including
construction   engineering   agriculture   trucking  maritime   automotive
aviation  fleet and asset management  consumer  mobile appliances  military
invehicle  navigation  timing and recreation  previous position technologies
limited users to the simultaneous determination of only two dimensionslatitude
and  longitudewhile  altitude and time  required  separate  measurements  with
different  equipment  global positioning systems can complement or replace many
other forms of electronic  navigation and positioning  data systems  gps offers
major advantages over prior technologies in terms of ease of use precision and
accuracy with worldwide coverage in three dimensions  in addition to providing
time and velocity measurement  capabilities  gps technology provides users with
latitude longitude altitude and time measurements using a single solution

     gps is a system of 27 orbiting navstar satellites established and funded by
the us  government  which have been fully  operational  since march 1995 gps
positioning  is based  on a  trilateration  technique  that  precisely  measures
distances from three or more navstar  satellites  the  satellites  continuously
transmit precisely timed radio signals using extremely accurate atomic clocks a
gps receiver calculates distances from the satellites in view by determining the
travel time of a signal from the  satellite to the  receiver  the receiver then
trilaterates its position using its known distance from various satellites  and
calculates  latitude  longitude and  altitude  under normal  circumstances  a
current  standalone gps receiver is able to calculate its position at any point
on earth in the earths  atmosphere  or in lower earth orbit to approximately
10 meters  24 hours a day  when a gps  receiver  is coupled  with a  reference
receiver with known precise  position  accuracy of less than ten centimeters is
possible in addition gps provides highly accurate time measurement

      the usefulness of gps is dependent upon the locations of the receiver and
the gps  satellites  that are above the horizon at any given  time  the current
deployment  of 27 satellites  permits  threedimensional  worldwide  coverage 24
hours a day however reception of gps signals requires lineofsight visibility
between  the  navstar  satellites  and the  receiver  which can be  blocked  by
buildings  hills and dense  foliage  for the  receiver to collect a sufficient
signal  the receiver must have a line of sight to at least three  satellites in
order to determine its location in two  dimensionslatitude  and longitudeand
at least four  satellites  to  determine  its  location  in three  dimensions  
latitude  longitude  and altitude  the accuracy of gps may also be limited by
distortion of gps signals from ionospheric and other atmospheric conditions and
intentional or inadvertent signal  interference or selective

                                       2

availability saselective availability which was the largest component of gps
distortion  is controlled by the us  department of defense and on may 1 2000
was  deactivated  selective  availability may be implemented at any time by the
us  department of defense in order to deny hostile forces the highly  accurate
position  time and velocity  information  supplied by gps in certain  military
applications  classified  devices are utilized to decode the sa  component  and
compute an undegraded solution

     by using a technique  called  differential  gps involving two or more gps
receivers position accuracies can currently be improved to approximately one to
three meters for navigation  submeter for precision positioning and less than
ten  centimeters  for survey and machine  guidance  applications  even if sa is
activated  this  technique  compensates  for a number of potential  measurement
distortions  including  distortions caused by ionospheric and other atmospheric
conditions  as well as distortions  intentionally introduced into the satellite
data itself  such as sa  differential  gps involves  placing one receiver at a
known location and continuously comparing its calculated location with its known
location to measure  distortions  in the signal  transmission  and errors in the
satellite  data at any one time  most  distortions  and errors are  reasonably
constant  over large  areas  so that one or more remote gps  receivers  can use
these  measurements  to correct  their own  position  calculations  measurement
corrections can be transmitted either in realtime over a suitable communication
link such as radio or telephone  or integrated later with accumulated  data as
is in some highly precise scientific applications

      each of  trimbles  gps  products is based on  proprietary  gps  receiver
technology  trimbles gps  receivers are capable of tracking all  satellites in
view and automatically selecting the optimum combination of satellites necessary
to provide the most accurate set of measurements  possible gps positioning data
is most useful when  presented  communicated  and managed in an efficient  and
functional  manner  the  recent   technological   convergence  of  positioning
wireless  and information  technologies enables significant new capabilities in
positioning  systems  gps data  coupled  with  valueadded  functionality  from
wireless   communications    information   technology    nongps   positioning
technologies  and customized  user  interfaces  can provide a complete  position
solution   in  addition   recent   developments  in  wireless  technology  and
deployments of wireless  networks have enabled more efficient and less expensive
wireless  communications  such  developments  allow for the rapid and efficient
transfer of gps data to locations away from the gps field device improving data
usefulness  and  functionality  by making the data  accessible  to an  increased
number of users  accessing  delivering and using positioncentric  information
efficiently  can result in significant  productivity  increases to the enduser
with  the  convergence  of  gps  and  advanced   information  and  communication
technologies  trimble is focused on  creating  integrated  applicationspecific
systems that solve enduser  problems in targeted markets by optimizing  product
features and functionality and increasing enduser productivity  thus providing
a complete valueadded positioning solution

       navstar   satellites  and  their  ground  support  systems  are  complex
electronic  systems  subject to electronic and mechanical  failures and possible
sabotage the satellites were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and
are subject to damage by the hostile  space  environment  in which they operate
however  of the current deployment of 27 satellites in place some have already
been in place for 12 years and they have an  average  age of 6 years  to repair
damaged or malfunctioning  satellites is currently not economically feasible if
a significant number of satellites were to become  inoperable  there could be a
substantial  delay before they are replaced with new satellites  a reduction in
the number of operating  satellites  would impair the current utility of the gps
system  and the  growth of  current  and  additional  market  opportunities  in
addition  there  can be no  assurance  that the  us  government  will  remain
committed to the operation and maintenance of gps satellites over a long period
or that the policies of the us  government  for the use of gps without  charge
will remain unchanged however a 1996 presidential decision directive marks the
first time in the  evolution  of gps that  access for  civilian  use has a solid
foundation in law because of  everincreasing  commercial  applications of gps
other us  government agencies may become involved in the administration or the
regulation of the use of gps signals  any of the foregoing factors could affect
the willingness of buyers of the companys  products to select gpsbased systems
instead of products  based on competing  technologies  any resulting  change in
market demand for gps products could have a material adverse effect on trimbles
financial results in 1995 certain european government  organizations expressed
concern  regarding  the  susceptibility  of  gps  equipment  to  intentional  or
inadvertent  signal  interference  such concern  could  translate  into reduced
demand for gps products in certain geographic regions in the future

     laser and optical products measure  distances very accurately by means of a
light beam  trimble generally uses laser diodes to create laser light beams for
its  applications  the light  emitted by lasers is more  concentrated  around a
single  frequency  than  conventional  light  sources  allowing a more accurate
distance measurement

solectron   federal  systems   inc   collectively   solectron   currently
manufactures most of trimbles gps products  we also have production facilities
in danderyd sweden jena and kaiserslautern in germany and dayton ohio for the
manufacture of our optical and laser products

     to achieve distribution  marketing  production and technology advantages
for  our  targeted  markets   we  manage  our  five  industry  segments  within
corresponding  divisions  to focus on market needs we manage our five industry
segments  through a  divisional  structure  each  division is  responsible  for
strategy  sales and marketing  product development and financial  performance
each division is headed by a general manager

     although we believe that these divisions have growth potential for sales of
our products  there can be no assurance  that such  divisions  will continue to
grow  particularly  given that gpsbased systems are still in an early stage of
adoption in some of these markets  our future growth will depend on our ability
to develop  the  industry  markets  in which we  currently  compete  and on our
ability to continue to identify and exploit new markets for our products

engineering and construction

     we continue to focus on the large market  opportunities  in the engineering
and construction  market segment  in addressing this market segment  we employ
all of our key technologies to develop and introduce  positionbased  solutions
including  gps  optical   laser  wireless  communication  and  softwarebased
information  technologies  we currently  offer a range of hardware and software
products that are used by survey and construction professionals in the field for
determining  position data  collection  field computing  data management  and
automated  machine guidance and control  these products  provide  solutions for
numerous construction applications  including surveying general construction
site preparation and excavation  road and runway construction  and underground
construction

     our  engineering  and  construction  products  reduce  the need for  manual
calculations  and operations in the field  thereby  improving  productivity and
providing  significant potential cost savings that can be achieved by decreasing
project  completion  times and reducing the need for rework resulting from human
error  building on our leadership  position in the construction arena our goal
is  to  provide  comprehensive   fieldtooffice  solutions  that  enable  our
endusers to tightly integrate field  construction  operations with their office
information systems through the use of our positioning  wireless  communication
and   software   technologies   we  believe  that   considerable   productivity
improvements  and cost  savings  can be  achieved  by such  solutions  that will
effectively   streamline  the  use  of  information  in  the   engineering   and
construction  process  from project concept to completion  for example if the
field and the office are tightly  integrated  data collected and created in the
project  feasibility  phase can be used and modified in the design  phase  data
resulting  from  the  design  phase  can be used to  automate  processes  in the
construction  phase  finally  data collected from the construction site can be
used not only for important  monitoring  purposes  but also to effect  required
design  changes back at the office  which can then be implemented in the field
by  providing  complete  solutions  that  link the field to the  office  through

component technologies

     as a leading provider of gps components  we currently market our component
products  through an  extensive  network of oem  relationships  these  products
include proprietary  chipsets  modules and a variety of intellectual  property
the  applications  into which  endusers  currently  incorporate  our  component
products include  timing  applications for synchronizing  wireless and computer
systems   invehicle  navigation  and  telematics  systems  fleet  management
security  systems  data  collection  systems  and wireless  handheld  consumer
products  our timing products are used in applications  such as wireless clocks
and   network   synchronization   we   provide   timing   products   to   major
telecommunications infrastructure suppliers such as nortel networks and glenayre
technologies

      we believe that technological advances in component technology including
reduced  size  cost and power  consumption  and increased  functionality  will
continue  to drive gps into a  variety  of new  high  volume  applications  in
particular  as gpsbased timing and location  information  becomes available at
reduced  cost it will migrate from current  commercial  uses to the high volume
consumer markets  the following is a selected list of some of the products that
we believe will incorporate gps functionality wireless handheld products smart
phones  pagers  e911sos  phones  child and  personal  locators  automobile

magneti  marelli  automobile  manufacturers  that currently  purchase  products
incorporating  our  gps  technology  include  alfa  romeo  bmw  fiat  honda
mercedes  opel porsche  renault  toyota and vwaudi japan is currently the
worlds  largest gps automobile  navigation  system  market  with eurpoe as the
second largest market to date gps automobile  navigation system penetration in
the us  market  has been  relatively  low due to high  prices  and the lack of
digital maps in 1998  however a number of automobile oems in the us started
making  navigation  and  emergency  response  systems  standard in some highend
vehicles  such as the gm onstar  system for  cadillac  we believe  that incar
navigation  systems will eventually become commonplace as system prices continue
to decline

      the largest  domestic  consumer  market for gps components is expected to
become the  wireless  handset  market  the fcc has  mandated  that all cellular
phones  must  identify  their  location  to within 125 meters for 911  emergency
calls  this  enhanced  911 e911  mandate  takes effect in october 2001 and is
creating the need for the wireless  carriers and handset  manufacturers  to find
ways to meet the mandates  requirements  gps technology provides an attractive
solution to meet or exceed the  requirements  of the e911  mandate  this market
will require very small lowcost gps components that consume very little power
we believe that we are well positioned to

                                       8

      trimble  expects that a  significant  portion of future  revenues will be
derived  from  sales of newly  introduced  products  consequently  our  future
success  depends in part on our ability to  continue to develop and  manufacture
new competitive products with timely market  introductions  advances in product
technology  will require  continued  investment in research and  development  in
order to maintain and enhance our market position

manufacturing

     in  august  of 1999  trimble  began  outsourcing  the  manufacture  of our
gpsbased  products  reducing  our need to make costly  investments  solectron
corporation   solectron  currently   manufactures  our  gps  products  and  is
responsible for nearly all material procurement  assembly and testing  product
design through pilot production remains in the hands of trimble while solectron
is responsible  for most facets of the  manufacturing  process  we are directly
involved in qualifying vendors and the key components used in our products

     we manufacture our optical and laserbased  products at four  manufacturing
facilities  located in dayton  ohio  danderyd  sweden and kaiserslautern and
jena germany  some of these products and subassemblies are also assembled on a
contract basis

                                       11

     in addition as of december 2000 trimble maintains a manufacturing facility
in austin  texas  primarily  focused on faa certified  products for commercial
aviation and military systems  as discussed in the industry segment section as
of march 6  2001  we have  sold our air  transport  systems  business  that is
located in austin and it is our intent to close our austin operations in august
of 2001  at that time  we will  transfer the faa  certified  military  systems
business  to  our  manufacturing  facility  in  sunnyvale  california  we  are
currently in the process of transferring our faa certifications to our sunnyvale
manufacturing facility

     while most of the  components  used in our products are standard and can be
obtained from multiple  qualified  manufactures  some of our key components are
proprietary or sole sourced and require extended lead times if we were required
to find new vendors for these sole or limited sourced components  we would have
to qualify replacement  components and possibly  reconfigure our products  this
qualification  or  reconfiguration  process  could  result in  product  shipment
delays  our supply management team works closely with  strategically  important
suppliers who provide sole or limited sourced products

     we will continue to provide  stateofthe art computer aided design service
capabilities  to our  development  community  relating to printed  circuit board
pcb layout  assembly drawing and schematic  development  we intend to remain
selfsufficient  in this field to ensure that the development  entities can have
the  maximum  benefit  from the  utilization  of  their  time  while  including
automatic  test  capability  on the  board  contributing  to  faster  and  more
effective product release cycles

backlog

     trimble  believes that due to the volume of products  delivered  from shelf
inventories and the shortening of product delivery  schedules  backlog is not a
meaningful  indicator of future business prospects  therefore  we believe that
backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business

patents trademarks and licenses

     our success  depends to a significant  extent on technical  innovation  we
pursue  an  active   program   of  filing   patent   applications   to   protect
technologically   sensitive   features  of  our  products   we  currently  hold
approximately  370 us  gps related  patents and  approximately  20 foreign gps
related  patents that expire at various dates no earlier than 2005 we also have
approximately  100 laser or optical  related  patents  worldwide  we  currently
license certain peripheral  aspects of our technology from spectrum  information
technologies  and  georesearch  trimble  may enter  into  additional  licensing
arrangements in the future relating to its technologies

     at  present  there  are  87  trademarks   registered  to  trimble  and  its
subsidiaries   specifically   trimble   with  the  sextant  logo   trimble
navigation  geoexplorer  and gps total station are trademarks of trimble
navigation  limited  registered  in the  united  states  and  other  countries
trimble with the globe and triangle logo and additional trademarks are pending
registration  trimble navigation  limited  acknowledges the trademarks of other
organizations  for their  respective  products  or  services  mentioned  in this
document

     although we believe that our patents and trademarks  have value  there can
be no assurance that those patents and trademarks or any additional patents and
trademarks  that  may  be  obtained  in  the  future  will  provide  meaningful
protection from  competition  we actively  develop and protect our intellectual
property through a program of patenting enforcement and licensing

     we do not  believe  that  any of our  products  infringe  patent  or  other
proprietary  rights of third parties  but we cannot be certain that they do not
do so see note 21 to  consolidated  financial  statements if infringement is
alleged  legal defense  costs could be material  and there can be no assurance
that the necessary  licenses could be obtained on terms or conditions that would
not have a material adverse effect on our profitability

     as of december 29 2000 trimble employed 2306 people 536 in research and
development  926 in  sales  and  marketing  619 in  manufacturing  and 225 in

                                       12

     trimbles  success  depends  in  part  on the  continued  contribution  and
longterm  effectiveness of our employees  competition in recruiting  personnel
can be  significant  in some labor markets and our continued  ability to attract
and retain  highly  skilled  employees  is  essential  to our future  growth and
success  our employees are not  represented by labor unions  except in certain
european  countries  where union  membership  is almost  universal  we have not
experienced work stoppages

recent business developments

     effective as of july 14 2000  trimble  completed the  acquisition  of the
spectra  precision  wholly owned  businesses  formerly owned by thermo  electron
corporation  thermo  electron  collectively known as the spectra precision
group for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 294 million subject to
a final  adjustment  in the purchase  price as provided  for in the  acquisition
agreements  the  acquisition  included  100 of the stock of spectra  precision
inc a delaware  corporation  spectra  precision srl an italian  corporation
spectra physics holdings gmbh a german corporation and spectra precision bv a
netherlands  corporation  the acquisition  also consisted of certain assets and
liabilities of spectra  precision ab a swedish  corporation  including 100 of
the shares of spectra  precision  sa a french  corporation  spectra  precision
scandinavia  ab a swedish  corporation  spectra  precision  of canada  ltd a
canadian  corporation   and  spectra  precision  handelsges  mbh  an  austrian
corporation  the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase transaction  see
liquidity and capital  resources for a description of how this acquisition was
financed

     the spectra  precision group develops  instruments and systems that provide
positioning  solutions for two market  segments  engineering  construction and
agriculture  within  those  segments  are  four  major  customer  applications
surveying construction site positioning  construction and agricultural machine
control and software

     spectra   precision  group  products   generally   measure  distances  very
accurately by means of a light beam in addition  they have  capabilities  that
provide  the  capability  to uniquely  solve  positioning  problems  such as the
determination of angles with high accuracy

      the company expects that the  acquisition of the spectra  precision group
will  strengthen  trimbles  position  as  a  leading  provider  of  positioning
solutions  worldwide  the  acquisition  also  gives  trimble  one of  the  most
comprehensive  product portfolios in the industry  strengthens its distribution
network  and serves as a platform for future growth the complementary  product
lines and technologies of trimble and the spectra  precision group  should help
the combined  company to become a leader in the  engineering  and  construction
agriculture  and fleet and asset management market segments  in addition  the
spectra precision groups  wellestablished  and extensive  distribution network
should extend  trimbles  reach into new segments of its target market  segments
both  domestically and  internationally  although there was very little overlap
between  each of the  companies  product  offerings  two areas of overlap were
identified  and the company has  announced  plans to  discontinue  trimbles tts
optical survey family and the spectra  precision  groups elta and geotracer gps
receivers

      as part of the acquisition of the spectra  precision  group  trimble has
identified  approximately  20  million of annual cost  synergies  we expect to
realize 8 to 10 million of these  benefits in fiscal 2001 and realize the full
benefit in fiscal  2002 and beyond  however  the company is still in the early
stages of combining  trimble and the spectra  precision  group and this involves
certain  inherent  risks  including  the potential  inability to  successfully
integrate  acquired   operations  and  businesses  or  to  realize   anticipated
synergies  economies  of  scale  or  other  value  diversion  of  managements
attention  difficulties  in  coordinating  the  management of operations at new
sites  and the  possible  loss of key  employees  of acquired  operations  the
companys  profitability  may suffer if we are unable to successfully  integrate
and manage this  acquisition  or if we do not  generate  sufficient  revenue to
offset the increased expenses associated with this acquisition

     trimbles  current  strategy  for the ongoing  integration  of the spectra
precision group is to focus on leveraging existing  technologies  distribution
and  marketing  resources  and  identifying  and taking  advantage  of synergies
between  the  companies  the  companys  initial  priorities  for the  combined
entities are centered on the following

     o  the  reconciliation  and  alignment  of  distribution  channels  and the
        achievement of our market targets and cost synergies the largest
        portion of the cost synergies result from the consolidation of redundant
        facilities

     o  defining the basic corporate organization reporting and structure this
        included  the  announcement  by trimble in august  2000 of its new
        segment  and management  organization   as  part  of  the  august  2000
        announcement the engineering  and  construction  division of trimble is
        headquartered  from our

     engineering and construction  revenues increased by 80 in fiscal 2000 over
fiscal  1999  the  increase  in  2000  revenue  compared  to 1999 is due to the
following
     o  revenues generated since the purchase of the spectra  precision group in
        july 2000 which accounted for approximately 870 million for the
        period july 14 2000 through december 29 2000
     o  strong demand for gps machine  guidance  equipment for  construction
        applications
     o  these  increases  were  partially  offset due to continued  delivery
        problems related to critical part shortages in our supply chain

     engineering  and  construction  revenues  decreased 12 in fiscal 1999 from
fiscal 1998  the 1999 decrease is due to the  following
     o  sales were impacted from the change in commission structure for some of
        our products from commission dealers to buysell dealers in fiscal 1999
        under the buysell arrangement the product is discounted to the dealer
        as opposed to  enduser  pricing  with commissions  recorded under sales
        and marketing expense
     o  in the fourth quarter of 1999  delivery  problems due to critical part
        shortages in our supply chain and  transitional issues with outsourcing
        our manufacturing had a negative impact on revenue for the fiscal year
        ended 1999

agriculture

     agriculture revenues increased by 103 in fiscal 2000 over fiscal 1999 the
2000 increase in revenue  compared to 1999 is due to the  following
     o  revenues generated since the purchase of the spectra  precision group in
        july 2000 which accounted  for  approximately  69 million for the
        period july 14 2000 through december 29 2000
     o  introduction of new products including the aggps 170 field computer
        the aggps 114 and the pso plus  parallel  swathing  option with data
        logging
     o  strong growth in demand for gps agriculture  products in general
     o  these increases were partially offset due to continued delivery problems
        related to critical part shortages in our supply chain

     agriculture  revenues were not broken out  separately  for fiscal year 1998
because it is  impracticable  to do so  therefore there is no comparison of the
increase in revenue in the agriculture  segment from fiscal 1998 to fiscal 1999
the results of this division were included in the engineering  and  construction
segment for fiscal 1998

fleet and asset management

     fleet and asset  management  revenues  decreased  by 3 in fiscal 2000 over
fiscal 1999 the 2000 revenue change compared to 1999 is due to the following
     o  asset  management  and  tracking  product  revenues  were down due to
        continued delivery  problems  related to critical part  shortages in our
        supply  chain
     o  these  decreases  were  partially  offset by  increased  demand  in our
        mapping products especially our new geoexplorer 3 used for gis data
        collection and data maintenance  in  addition  unit sales for our
        crosscheck  family of  products increased by 30 over prior year

     fleet and asset  management  revenues  increased  by 4 in fiscal 1999 from
fiscal 1998  the 1999 increase is due primarily to the growth of revenue in our
pathfinder proxr and pathfinder proxrs products based on volume growth

component technologies

     component  technologies revenues increased by 3 in fiscal 2000 over fiscal
1999 the 2000 revenue change compared to 1999 is due to the following
     o  strong demand for gps  embedded  applications  such as vehicle  tracking
        and safety and security
     o  the above  increases  were partially  offset by continued  delivery
        problems related to critical part shortages in our supply chain

     component technologies revenues increased by 62 in fiscal 1999 from fiscal
1998  the 1999 increase is due primarily to strong growth in our automotive and
timing markets

portfolio technologies

     portfolio  technologies revenues decreased by 3 in fiscal 2000 over fiscal
1999  the 2000 revenue  decrease  compared to 1999 is due to the  following
     o  decreases  in revenues  for military  and air  transport  products
     o  trimbles decision to exit the  commercial  marine  business in the
        fourth quarter of 1998 and the sale of the last of such products in the
        second quarter of 1999

                                       24
page

     portfolio technologies revenues decreased by 45 in fiscal 1999 from fiscal
1998 the 1999 decrease is due to the following
     o  trimble  decided to exit the commercial  marine  business in the fourth
        quarter of 1998 and sold the last of such  products in the second
        quarter of 1999
     o  commercial  air  transport  was down  due to  decreases  in market
        demand  and the  successful  conclusion  of shipments in fiscal 1998 to
        american  airlines and continental  airlines through our  honeywell
        alliance  which were not  repeated in fiscal  1999
     o  military systems declined due to the completion of our cugr contract in
        the first quarter of 1998 which sales were not repeated in 1999

      export sales export sales from domestic  operations  as a percentage of
total  revenue  were  34 in  2000  38 in  1999  and 34 in  1998  sales to
unaffiliated  customers in foreign locations  as a percentage of total revenue
were 52 in 2000 52 in 1999 and 46 in 1998 trimble  anticipates that export
revenue and sales made by its  subsidiaries  in locations  outside the us will
continue to account for a significant  portion of its revenue  for this reason
trimble is subject to the risks  inherent in these sales  including  unexpected
changes in regulatory requirements  exchange rates  governmental approval and
tariffs or other barriers  even though the us  government  announced on march
29 1996 that it would support and maintain the gps system  and on may 1 2000
eliminated the use of selective  availability sa  a method of degrading gps
accuracy  there may be a  reluctance  in certain  foreign  markets to purchase
products  based  on gps  technology  given  the  control  of  gps  by the  us
government  trimbles results of operations could be adversely  affected if the
company  were  unable to continue to  generate  significant  sales in  locations
outside the us

     no  single  customer  including  the  us  government  and its  agencies
accounted for 10 or more of the companys  total revenues in 2000 1999 or1998
it is possible however that in future periods the failure of one or more large
customers  to purchase  products in  quantities  anticipated  by the company may
adversely affect the results of operations

      gross margin  gross margin varies due to a number of factors  including
product mix domestic versus international sales  customer type the effects of
production volumes and fixed  manufacturing costs on unit product costs and new
product  startup  costs  the gross margin  percentage  on product  sales  not
including a 46 million charge for inventory  purchase  accounting  adjustments
for the acquisition of the spectra  precision group was 54 in 2000 and 53 for
1999  compared with 47 in fiscal 1998 the fiscal 2000 gross margin percentage
increased over fiscal year 1999 due to the favorable  product mix of engineering
and  construction and agriculture  products  which yield higher margins through
the  integration of software and wireless  communications  in addition  it was
favorably  impacted by the cost benefits of  outsourcing  our  manufacturing  to
solectron  these  increases  were  partially  offset by higher costs to acquire
components  due to the  worldwide  component  shortages  the  increase in gross
margin  percentage in fiscal 1999 as compared to fiscal 1998  primarily  reflect
improved  manufacturing  cost controls achieved through the consolidation of the
manufacturing  organization  resulting  in  improved  efficiencies  and reduced
inventory  in  addition  gross  margins in the second  half of fiscal 1999 were
favorably  impacted by the cost benefits of  outsourcing  our  manufacturing  to
solectron because of product mix changes within and among the industry markets
market  pressures on unit selling  prices  fluctuations  in unit  manufacturing
costs including increases in component prices and other factors  current level
gross margins cannot be assured

      trimble  expects that in the future a higher  percentage  of its business
will be conducted  through  alliances  with strategic  partners  as a result of
volume  pricing and the  assumption of certain  operating  costs by the partner
margins  on this  business  are  likely  to be  lower  than  sales  directly  to
endusers

     research and development  research and development  spending  increased in
absolute dollars during fiscal 2000 representing 13 of revenue  compared with
13 in 1999 and 17 in 1998  the  increase in absolute  dollars in research and
development  expenses in 2000 are due  primarily  to the purchase of the spectra
precision group in july 2000 which accounted for approximately  99 million of
the increase  the increase was also due to  approximately  22 million less of
cost reimbursement funds received for projects there were also increases in our
facilities costs of approximately 1 million the increases are partially offset
by decreases in our expense of approximately  34 million related to personnel
temporary help and consulting

     the  dollar  decrease  from  1998  to 1999  is due to  trimbles  receiving
approximately 42 million more funds from cost  reimbursement  projects in 1999
as compared to 1998 also there were decreases in our expenses of approximately
50 million related to electronics parts depreciation  travel personnel and
other  supplies  as  part  of  the  companys  restructuring  plans  which  were
implemented in the last half of fiscal 1998

     sales and marketing  sales and marketing  expenses increased during fiscal
2000  representing  22 of  revenues  as compared  with 20 in 1999 and 23 in
1998 the primary reason for the dollar and percentage increase in expenses from
1999 to 2000 is the purchase of the spectra  precision group in july 2000 which
had approximately  266 million in sales and marketing expenses recorded in the
period subsequent to trimbles acquisition

     the primary reason for the dollar and  percentage  decline in expenses from
1998  to  1999  is  decreases  of  approximately   77  million  in  personnel
consultants  travel  advertising  trade shows  expensed demo equipment  and
other office  supplies as part of the companys  restructuring  plan  which was
implemented in the last half of fiscal 1998 in addition sales commissions were
lower as a percentage of sales  due to the change in dealer  structure for some
of our product lines from commission dealers to buysell arrangements

      trimbles future growth will depend in part on the timely development and
continued  viability  of the markets in which we currently  compete  and on our
ability to  continue to identify  and exploit new markets for our  products  in
addition we have encountered  significant  competition in selected markets and
we expect  such  competition  to  intensify  as the market for gps  applications
receives  acceptance  several of trimbles  competitors are major  corporations
with  substantially  greater  financial  technical  and  marketing  resources
increased competition may result in reduced market share and is likely to result
in  price  reductions  of  gpsbased  products  which  could  adversely  affect
trimbles revenues and profitability

     general and administrative  general and administrative  expenses decreased
during fiscal 2000 representing 8 of revenues  compared with 12 in both 1999
and 1998  the  decrease  in fiscal 2000 as compared to fiscal 1999 is due to an
allowance  for  doubtful  accounts  charge in fiscal  1999  related  to  certain
customers in south  america  which was not repeated in fiscal 2000  we also had
decreases  of  approximately  61  million in expenses  related for  personnel
legal  facilities  equipment and other office  supplies  the  decreases  were
partially offset by approximately  30 million of the spectra precision groups
expenses included since its purchase in july 2000

     the increase in absolute dollars from 1998 to 1999 is due to an increase in
the  allowance  for  doubtful  accounts  related to certain  customers  in south
america for 1999 and an increase in building rental costs due to the renewal of
many of our  building  leases  this  increase  was  partially  offset  by space
consolidations  as part of our  restructuring  efforts in the fourth  quarter of
1998

     restructuring reserves

     2000  acquisition  restructuring  reserves  as  noted  in  note  9 to  the
consolidated financial statements as a result of the acquisition of the spectra
precision  group  the company accrued  approximately  90 million for costs to
close certain  duplicative office facilities and combine operations and relocate
certain  employees  these  costs  were  accrued  as  part  of  the  preliminary
allocation  of the  purchase  price  the  facility  consolidation  and employee
relocations will result from primarily  combining  certain office facilities and
duplicative functions  including management functions of the spectra precision
group the company has not yet finalized its plans to consolidate facilities and
to relocate  employees  nor has it finalized a determination of the total costs
to be incurred upon the  termination  of certain office  facility  leases or its
ability to sublease vacated office space  accordingly  unresolved issues could
result in an increase or decrease in the liabilities for facility consolidation
the  discontinuance  of overlapping  product  lines  employee  relocation  and
related tax and legal expenses  these adjustments  if any will be reported as
an increase or decrease in goodwill  through december 29 2000 the company had
charged  809000  which  consisted  of  inventory  writeoffs  related  to the
discontinuance  of  overlapping  product  lines  against the  reserve  and the
accrual for future  costs to be incurred  was 82 million at december 29 2000
the company anticipates on utilizing this reserve by the end of fiscal 2001

     the  elements of the  reserve at fiscal year end 2000 on the balance  sheet

     1998  restructuring  charges  as  noted  in  note  9 to  the  consolidated
financial statements during the year ended january 1 1999 the company recorded
a restructuring charge of 103 million classified as operating expenses  these
charges  were a result  of the  companys  reorganization  to  improve  business
processes and to decrease  organizational  redundancies  to improve  management
accountability and to improve the companys focus on profitable operations as a
result of the  reorganization  the company downsized its operations  including
reducing  headcount and facilities space usage and canceled its enterprise wide
information  system project and certain research and development  projects  the
impact of these  decisions was that  significant  amounts of the companys fixed
assets  prepaid  expenses  and purchased  technology were impaired and certain
liabilities  incurred  the company  wrote down the related  assets to their net
realizable values and made provisions for the estimated liabilities

     goodwill and other purchased intangibles  amortization expense of goodwill
and  other  intangibles  increased  for the  year  ended  december  29  2000 by
approximately 134 million related to the purchase of spectra precision group

includes  interest  income and  expense  as well as gains and losses on foreign
currency transactions

     foreign  exchange losses were 376000 in fiscal 2000  compared with gains
of 28000 in 1999 and gains of 234000 in 1998  trimbles  policy is to hedge
its exposure to foreign currency transactions in order to minimize the effect of
changes  in  foreign  currency   exchange  rates  on  consolidated   results  of
operations  gains and losses arising from foreign  currency  forward  contracts
offset gains and losses resulting from the underlying hedged transactions

     interest  income  increased in 2000 from 1999 as well as in 1999 from 1998
the higher  interest  income in 2000 and 1999 is due  primarily to the increased
interest  income received on cash and shortterm  investments  because of higher
average balances

     interest expense increased in fiscal 2000 due to financing obtained for the
acquisition of the spectra  precision group  interest expense includes interest
on a 2000 million credit  facility and an 800 million  subordinated  sellers

respectively  the 2000 and 1999  income  tax rates  are less  than the  federal
statutory  rate of 35 due  primarily to the  realization  of the benefits from
prior net operating losses and previously reserved deferred tax assets the 1998
income tax rate  differs  from the federal  statutory  rate  due  primarily  to
foreign taxes and the inability to realize the benefit of net operating losses

     inflation the effects of inflation on trimbles financial results have not
been significant to date

litigation

      trimble is involved in a number of legal  matters as discussed in note 21
to the  consolidated  financial  statements  while  trimble  does not expect to
suffer  significant  adverse  effects  from  these  litigation  matters  or from
unasserted claims the nature of litigation is unpredictable and there can be no
assurance that it will not do so

liquidity and capital resources

      at december  29  2000  trimble had cash and cash  equivalents  of 409
million and had no shortterm  investments  trimbles cash and cash equivalents
and shortterm investments decreased from the prior year due to the purchase of
the spectra precision group in july 2000  trimbles  longterm debt consists of
162 million  outstanding  under senior  secured  credit  facilities  and a 80
million subordinated  promissory note in the past trimble has relied primarily
on cash  provided  by  operating  and  financing  activities  and net  sales  of
shortterm  investments  to fund capital  expenditures  the  repurchase  of the
companys common stock and other investing activities management believes that
its cash and cash equivalents balances  together with its new credit facility
will be sufficient to meet its anticipated operating cash needs for at least the
next twelve months

      in fiscal  2000  the cash  provided by  operating  activities  was 219
million  as compared to cash  provided  of 236  million in the  corresponding
period in fiscal  1999  cash  provided by operating  activities  in fiscal 2000
arose from the companys net income  plus  depreciation  and  amortization  and
increase in accounts  payable and offset  partially by increases in  inventories
and increases in accounts receivable  trimbles ability to continue to generate
cash from  operations  will  depend  in a large  part on  revenues  the rate of
collections  of  accounts  receivable  and  the  successful  management  of the
companys manufacturing relationship with solectron corporation

     cash provided by sales of common stock in fiscal year 2000  represents  the
proceeds from  purchases  made by employees  pursuant to trimbles  stock option
plan and employee  stock  purchase plan and totaled 120 million for the fiscal
year ended december 29 2000

     effective as of july 14 2000  trimble  completed the  acquisition  of the
spectra  precision group for an aggregate  purchase price of approximately  294
million  the acquisition  was financed with 80 million in seller  subordinated
debt  140  million of debt  provided  through a  syndicate  of banks  and 74
million of the companys  then  available cash on hand the company also expects
to incur up to 8 million of total  costs and  expenses in  connection  with the
acquisition of which approximately 7 million has already been incurred to date

     in order to finance the acquisition of the spectra  precision  group  fund
the companys  ongoing working capital  requirements  and pay related fees and
expenses of the  acquisition  trimble i obtained a new senior  secured

                                       28

credit facility ii issued an 80 million subordinated seller promissory note
iii  terminated its existing 50 million  unsecured  revolving credit facility
and iv prepaid its existing 30 million  outstanding  subordinated  promissory
notes  see note 2 to the condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  under
acquisition financing

     in 1996 and 1998 trimble approved a discretionary  program whereby up to a
total of 22 million shares of its common stock could be repurchased on the open
market by the company to offset the potential  dilutive  effects to earnings per
share from the  issuance  of  additional  stock  options  during 1997 and 1998
trimble  purchased a total of 122  million  shares at a cost of 179  million
during  fiscal  1999 and  fiscal  2000  no shares  were  repurchased  under the
discretionary  program  trimbles  current credit facility limits the amount of
its common stock it can repurchase  the company is allowed to repurchase shares
of its common stock only up to 25 of net income in the previous fiscal year

      the company  presently  expects  fiscal 2001 capital  expenditures  to be
approximately  120 million  primarily for computer equipment  software  and
leasehold improvements associated with business expansion

      trimble has evaluated the issues raised by the introduction of the single
european  currency euro for initial  implementation as of january 1 1999 and
during the transition period through january 1 2002 trimble does not currently
believe  that the  introduction  of the euro will have a material  effect on its
foreign exchange and hedging activities trimble has also assessed the potential
impact  the  euro  conversion  will  have  in  regard  to its  internal  systems
accommodating eurodenominated  transactions  trimble will continue to evaluate
the impact of the euro  introduction  over time  based on  currently  available
information  trimble does not currently  anticipate  any adverse  impact of the
euro conversion on the company

certain other risk factors

difficulties in integrating new acquisitions could adversely affect our
business

     critical  to  the  success  of  our  growth  is the  effective  and  timely
integration of acquired  businesses  into our  organization  if our integration
efforts are unsuccessful  our businesses will suffer we have recently acquired
the spectra precision group the acquisition presents unique product marketing
research and development facilities information systems accounting personnel
and other integration  challenges  this transition is still in its early stages
and involves certain risks  including  the potential inability to successfully
integrate  acquired   operations  and  businesses   the  inability  to  realize
anticipated   synergies  or  cost  reductions  or  other  value   diversion  of
managements  attention  difficulties in scaling up production at new sites and
coordinating management of operations at new sites and loss of key employees of
acquired operations also our information systems and those of the companies we
acquire are often  incompatible  requiring  substantial  upgrades to one or the
other  further  our current senior combined management is a combination of the
prior senior management teams of trimble and the spectra precision group several
of whom have not  previously  worked  with  other  members  of  management  the
benefits to us of the acquisition and our success as a whole  depends upon our
succeeding in each of these and other integration challenges  nevertheless the
integration of our business with another may result in unanticipated  operations
problems expenses and liabilities and the diversion of management attention

     our sales  force is and will be in the  future a  combination  of our sales
force  and  the  sales  forces  of the  businesses  we  acquire  which  must be
effectively  integrated  for us to remain  successful  our  acquisition  of the
spectra precision group has resulted in sales forces differing in products sold
marketing channels used and sales cycles and models applied accordingly we may
experience  disruption in sales and marketing in connection  with our efforts to
integrate  our  various  sales  and  marketing  forces  and we may be unable to
efficiently or effectively correct any such disruptions or achieve our sales and
marketing  objectives  if we  fail  in  these  efforts  furthermore  it may be
difficult to retain key sales personnel  as a result  we may fail to take full
advantage  of the  combined  sales  forces  efforts  and one  companys  sales
approaches and  distribution  channels may be  ineffective in promoting  another
entitys  products  all of which may  materially  harm our business  financial
condition or operating results

risks associated with sole suppliers and limited sources

     with the selection of solectron  corporation in august 1999 as an exclusive
manufacturing  partner for many of our gps products previously  manufactured out
of our sunnyvale  facilities  trimble is  substantially  dependent  upon a sole
supplier  for  the  manufacture  of  its  products  under  the  agreement  with
solectron  trimble  provides to solectron a twelvemonth  product  forecast and
places  purchase  orders with  solectron  sixty  calendar days in advance of the
scheduled delivery of products to trimble  customers  although trimble purchase
orders placed

                                       29
page

with solectron are cancelable  the terms of the agreement would require trimble
to purchase from  solectron all material  inventory not  returnable or usable by
other solectron customers accordingly if trimble inaccurately forecasts demand
for its  products  trimble  may be  unable  to  obtain  adequate  manufacturing
capacity from solectron to meet customers delivery  requirements or trimble may
accumulate  excess  inventories  in addition  we rely on sole  suppliers for a
number of our critical asics we have experienced  shortages of such supplies in
the past our reliance on sole or a limited group of suppliers  involves several
risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required
components  and reduced  control over pricing  the disruption or termination of
any of these  sources  could have a  material  adverse  effect on our  business
operating  results and financial  condition  any  inability to obtain  adequate
deliveries or any other  circumstance  that would require us to seek alternative
sources  of  supply  or  to  manufacture   such  components   internally   could
significantly  delay  our  ability  to ship our  products  which  could  damage
relationships  with current and prospective  customers and could have a material
adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

fluctuations in annual and quarterly performance

     our operating  results have  fluctuated  and can be expected to continue to
fluctuate in the future on a quarterly  and annual basis as a result of a number
of factors many of which are beyond our control results in any period could be
affected by changes in market  demand  competitive  market  conditions  market
acceptance  of  new or  existing  products  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency
exchange  rates  the  cost and  availability  of  components  our  ability  to
manufacture and ship products  the mix of our customer base and sales channels
the mix of  products  sold  our  ability  to expand  our  sales  and  marketing
organization  effectively  our ability to attract and retain key  technical and
managerial  employees  and general  economic  conditions  due to the  foregoing
factors  our operating results in one or more future periods are expected to be
subject to significant  fluctuations  in the event such fluctuations  result in
our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts
and investors the price of our common stock could decline substantially

     our revenues have historically tended to fluctuate on a quarterly basis due
to the timing of shipments of products under contracts and the sale of licensing
rights a significant portion of trimbles quarterly revenues occurs from orders
received and immediately  shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of
a quarter if orders are not received  or if shipments were to be delayed a few
days at the end of a quarter  the operating  results and reported  earnings per
share for that quarter  could be  significantly  impacted  future  revenues are
difficult to predict  and projections are based primarily on historical models
which are not necessarily accurate representations of the future

     despite the  fluctuations in its quarterly  sales  patterns  the companys
operating expenses are incurred on an approximately  ratable basis as a result
if expected sales are deferred for any reason the companys business operating
results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected

     trimbles  gross  margin  is  affected  by a number of  factors  including
product mix product  pricing  cost of components  foreign  currency  exchange
rates and manufacturing costs for example since engineering  construction and
agriculture   products  generally  have  higher  gross  margins  than  component
technologies products absent other factors a shift in sales toward engineering
 construction and agriculture products would lead to a gross margin improvement
for trimble  on the other hand if market conditions in the highly  competitive
engineering  construction  and  agriculture  market segments forced us to lower
unit prices  we would  suffer a decline in gross margin  unless we were able to
timely offset the price reduction by a reduction in production costs or by sales
of other products with higher gross margins either of these events could have a
material effect on our business operating results and financial condition

risks of managing future growth

     any  significant  growth in our sales or any  significant  expansion in the
scope of our operations  could strain our management  financial  manufacturing
and other  resources  and may require us to  implement  and improve a variety of
operating  financial and other systems  procedures and controls while trimble
plans significant expansion of its sales accounting  manufacturing  and other
information  systems to meet these  challenges  there can be no assurance  that
these efforts will succeed  or that any existing or new systems  procedures or
controls  will be  adequate  to  support  our  operations  or that our  systems
procedures  and  controls  will be designed  implemented  or improved in a cost
effective and timely manner  any failure to implement  improve and expand such
systems  procedures and controls in a timely and efficient  manner could have a
material  adverse  effect  on our  business  operating  results  and  financial
condition

                                       30

competition

     trimbles markets are highly competitive  our overall competitive position
depends on a number of factors  including the price  quality and performance of
our products  the level of customer service  the development of new technology
and our ability to participate in emerging markets  within each of our markets
we encounter direct  competition from other gps optical and laser suppliers and
competition  may  intensify  from  various  larger  domestic  and  international
competitors  and new  market  entrants  some of which  may be  current  trimble
customers  the competition in the future  may in some cases  result in price
reductions  reduced  margins  or loss  of  market  share  any of  which  could
materially and adversely  affect our business  operating  results and financial
condition  we believe  that our ability to compete  successfully  in the future
against  existing and additional  competitors will depend largely on our ability
to execute our  strategy  to provide  systems and  products  with  significantly
differentiated  features compared to currently available products  there can be
no assurance  that we will be able to implement this strategy  successfully  or
that any such products will be competitive  with other  technologies or products
that  may be  developed  by our  competitors  many of whom  have  significantly
greater  financial  technical   manufacturing   marketing  sales  and  other
resources  than we do there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete
successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures
faced by us will not have a material  adverse effect on our business  operating
results  and  financial  condition  we expect  that both  direct  and  indirect
competition will increase in the future  additional competition could adversely
affect our business  operating  results and financial  condition  through price
reductions or loss of market share

risks associated with international operations and sales

     our  customers  are located  throughout  the world  in  addition  we have
significant  offshore  operations  including  manufacturing  facilities  sales
personnel  and customer  support  operations  our offshore  operations  include
facilities in australia  canada china france  germany great britain japan
mexico  new zealand  sweden  russia  singapore and others our international
presence   exposes  us  to  risks  not  faced  by   whollydomestic   companies
specifically  we face the following risks among others  unexpected changes in
regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers political legal and
economic instability in foreign markets  particularly in those markets in which
we maintain manufacturing and research facilities  difficulties in staffing and
management  language and cultural  barriers  seasonal  reductions  in business
activities in the summer months in europe and some other countries  integration
of foreign  operations  longer payment cycles  greater  difficulty in accounts
receivable  collection  currency  fluctuations  and  potentially  adverse  tax
consequences although we implemented a program to manage foreign exchange risks
through  hedging  and  other  strategies  there can be no  assurance  that this
program will be successful and that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not
have a material  adverse  effect on our results of operations  in addition  in
certain foreign markets  there may be reluctance to purchase  products based on
gps technology given the control of gps by the us government

volatility of stock price

     our  common  stock  has  experienced  and  can be  expected  to  experience
substantial  price  volatility  in response to actual or  anticipated  quarterly
variations in results of operations  announcements of technological innovations
or new  products by us or our  competitors  developments  related to patents or
other  intellectual  property  rights  developments  in our  relationship  with
customers  suppliers  or strategic  partners  and other events or factors  in
addition  any short fall or changes in revenue  gross  margins  earnings  or
other financial results from analysts expectations could cause the price of our
common stock to fluctuate  significantly  additionally  certain macroeconomic
factors  such as changes in  interest  rates as well as market  climate  for the
hightechnology  sector  could also have an impact on the  trading  price of our
stock

dependence on proprietary technology risk of patent infringement claims

     trimbles  future  success and  competitive  position is dependent upon its
proprietary  technology  and we rely on patent  trade  secret  trademark  and
copyright law to protect our  intellectual  property  there can be no assurance
that the patents owned or licensed by us will not be invalidated  circumvented
challenged  or  licensed  to others  that the rights  granted  thereunder  will
provide competitive advantages to us or that any of our pending or future patent
applications will be issued within the scope of the claims sought by trimble if
at all  furthermore  there can be no  assurance  that  others will not develop
technologies  that are  similar or  superior to our  technology  duplicate  our
technology or design around the patents owned by trimble in addition effective
copyright patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not
applied for in certain  foreign  countries  there can be no assurance  that the
steps   taken  by  trimble  to  protect   its   technology   will   prevent  the
misappropriation of such technology

                                       31
page

     the value of our products relies  substantially on our technical innovation
in fields in which there are many current  patent  filings  trimble  recognizes
that as new patents are issued or are brought to our attention by the holders of
such patents  it may be necessary for us to withdraw  products from the market
take a license from such patent  holders  or redesign our  products  we do not
believe any of our  products  currently  infringe  patents or other  proprietary
rights  of  third  parties  but we  cannot  be  certain  they do not do so  in
addition   the  legal  costs  and   engineering   time  required  to  safeguard
intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant
expense of operations  such events could have a material  adverse effect on our
revenues  or  profitability  see  also note 21 to the  consolidated  financial
statements

dependence on new products

     trimbles future revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to
bring new  products  to  market  on a timely  basis  we must  continue  to make
significant  investments  in research  and  development  in order to continue to
develop new products enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance of
such  products  however  there  can be no  assurance  that  development  stage
products  will  be  successfully  completed  or  if  developed   will  achieve
significant  customer  acceptance  if we were  unable to  successfully  define
develop and introduce  competitive new products  and enhance existing products
our future results of operations  would be adversely  affected  development and
manufacturing  schedules for technology  products are difficult to predict  and
there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments
of new products  the timely  availability of these products in volume and their
acceptance by customers are important to the future success of trimble  in some
of our markets  for example  engineering    construction  where we currently
have a market leadership  position  a delay in new product  introductions could
have a  significant  impact on our results of  operations  no assurance  can be
given  that  we  will  not  incur  problems  in the  future  in  innovating  and
introducing  new  products  in  addition  some of our  products are subject to
governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold for example ce
certification for radiated  emissions is required for most gps receiver and data
communications  products sold in the european union an inability to obtain such
certifications  in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our operating
results

strategic alliances and external investments

     we are  continuously  evaluating  alliances  and  external  investments  in
technologies  related to our  business  and have  entered  into many  strategic
alliances  including making  relatively small strategic equity  investments in a
number of gps related technology companies acquisitions of companies divisions
of  companies  or products  and  alliances  and  strategic  investments  entail
numerous risks  including i the potential inability to successfully integrate
acquired operations and products or to realize anticipated synergies  economies
of scale or other value ii diversion of managements  attention  iii loss
of key employees of acquired operations and iv inability to recover strategic
investments  in  development  stage  entities  any such  problems  could have a
material  adverse effect on our business  financial  condition  and results of
operations

     we also believe that in certain emerging markets our success will depend on
our ability to form and maintain  strategic  alliances with  established  system
providers and industry leaders our failure to form and maintain such alliances
or the preemption of such  alliances by actions of other  competitors or us will
adversely affect our ability to penetrate emerging markets no assurances can be
given  that we will  not  incur  problems  from  current  or  future  alliances
acquisitions  or  investments  furthermore  there can be no assurance that we
will  realize  value  from  any  such  strategic  alliances   acquisitions  or
investments

dependence on key customers

     we currently enjoy strong  relationships with key customers  an increasing
amount of our revenue is generated from large oems such as philips vdo  nortel
caterpillar  cnh global  formerly  case  corporation  bosch  and others  a
reduction or loss of business with these customers could have a material adverse
effect on our  financial  condition and results of  operations  there can be no
assurance  that we  will  be  able to  continue  to  realize  value  from  these
relationships in the future

dependence on key markets and successful identification of new markets

     trimbles  current  products  serve  many  applications  in  engineering  
construction agriculture fleet  asset management component technologies and
portfolio  technologies  market segments  no assurances can be given that these
market segments will continue to generate  significant or consistent  demand for
our products

                                       32
page

existing market segments could be  significantly  diminished by new technologies
or products  that replace or render  obsolete  our  technologies  and  products
trimble is dependent on  successfully  identifying new markets for its products
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully identify
new highgrowth markets in the future  moreover there can be no assurance that
new markets will  develop for trimble or its  customers  products  or that our
technology or pricing will enable such markets to develop

dependence on retaining and attracting highly skilled development and managerial
personnel

     the ability of trimble to maintain its competitive  technological  position
will depend  in a large part on its ability to attract  motivate  and retain
highly qualified development and managerial personnel competition for qualified
employees in our industry and location is intense and there can be no assurance
that we will be able to attract  motivate and retain enough qualified employees
necessary for the future continued development of our business and products

potential adverse impact of governmental and other similar certifications

     trimble has certain  products that are subject to governmental  and similar
certifications  before  they can be sold  for  example  faa  certification  is
required for all aviation products also our products that use integrated radio
communication  technology  require  an  enduser  to obtain  licensing  from the
federal  communications  commission fcc for frequencyband  usage  during the
fourth quarter of 1998 the fcc  temporarily  suspended the issuance of licenses
for certain of our realtime  kinematic  products  because of interference  with
certain  other users of similar  radio  frequencies  an  inability  or delay in
obtaining such  certifications or delays of the fcc could have an adverse effect
on our operating results

dependence on radio frequency spectrum

     trimbles  gps   technology  is  dependent  on  the  use  of  the  standard
positioning  service sps provided by the us  governments global positioning
system gps  the gps sps operates in radio  frequency  bands that are globally
allocated for radio navigation satellite services  international allocations of
radio frequency are made by the international  telecommunications union itu a
specialized  technical  agency of the  united  nations  these  allocations  are
further governed by radio  regulations which have treaty status and which may be
subject to modification  every twothree years by the world radio  communication
conference  any itu reallocation of radio frequency bands  including frequency
band  segmentation or sharing of spectrum  may materially and adversely  affect
the utility and  reliability  of our  products  which would  in turn  cause a
material  adverse  effect  on  our  operating  results  in  addition  unwanted
emissions  from mobile  satellite  services  and other  equipment  operating  in
adjacent  frequency  bands or inband from  licensed and  unlicensed  devices may
materially  and adversely  affect the utility and  reliability  of our products
which could result in a material  adverse effect on our operating  results  the
federal communications commission fcc continually receives proposals for novel
technologies  and  services  which may seek to operate in or across  the radio
frequency bands currently used by the gps sps and other public safety  services
adverse decisions by the fcc that result in harmful interference to the delivery
of the gps sps may materially and adversely  affect the utility and  reliability
of our  products  which  could  result  in a  material  adverse  effect  on our
operating results

reliance on gps satellite network

     navstar  satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic
systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage the
satellites were  originally  designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject
to damage by the hostile space  environment in which they operate  however  of
the current  deployment  of 27  satellites  in place  some have already been in
place for 12 years and have an  average  age of 6 years  to repair  damaged  or
malfunctioning   satellites  is  currently  not  economically   feasible  if  a
significant  number of satellites  were to become  inoperable  there could be a
substantial  delay before they are replaced with new satellites  a reduction in
the number of operating  satellites  would impair the current utility of the gps
system  and the  growth of  current  and  additional  market  opportunities  in
addition  there  can be no  assurance  that the  us  government  will  remain
committed to the operation and maintenance of gps satellites over a long period
or that the policies of the us  government  for the use of gps without  charge
will remain unchanged however a 1996 presidential decision directive marks the
first time in the  evolution  of gps that access for civilian use free of direct
user fees is specifically  recognized and supported by presidential  policy  in
addition   presidential   policy  has  been   complemented   by   corresponding
legislation signed into law because of everincreasing commercial applications
of gps other us government agencies may become involved in the administration
or the regulation of the use of gps signals  any of the foregoing factors could
affect the willingness of buyers of the companys  products to select

                                       33
page

gpsbased  systems  instead of products  based on  competing  technologies  any
resulting change in market demand for gps products could have a material adverse
effect on trimbles financial results  for example  european  governments have
expressed interest in building an independent satellite navigation system known
as galileo  depending on the as yet  undetermined  design and operation of this
system  there  may be  interference  to the  delivery  of the  gps  sps and may
materially  and adversely  affect the utility and  reliability  of our products
which could result in a material adverse effect on our operating results

reliance on a continuous power supply

       california  is in the midst of an energy  crisis that could  disrupt our
operations and increase our expenses  in the event of an acute power  shortage
that is when power  reserves  for the state of  california  fall below  certain
critical levels  california has on some occasions  implemented  and may in the
future  continue to  implement  rolling  blackouts  throughout  california  we
currently do not have backup  generators  or  alternate  sources of power in the
event of a blackout and our current insurance does not provide coverage for any
damages we or our  customers may suffer as a result of any  interruption  in our
power  supply  if blackouts  interrupt  our power supply or  solectrons  power
supply we would be temporarily unable to continue  operations at our california
facilities  any such interruption in our ability to continue  operations at our
facilities or solectron to manufacture  product at its  facilities  could damage
our reputation  harm our ability to retain existing customers and to obtain new
customers  and could result in lost revenue  any of which could  substantially
harm our business and results of operations

new accounting standards

     in june 1998 the financial  accounting standards board issued statement of
financial  accounting  standards no 133 sfas 133  accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging  activities  as amended by sfas no 138 sfas 133 will
require  trimble to record all  derivatives  held on the  balance  sheet at fair
value  derivatives  that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value  through
income with respect to derivatives which are hedges depending on the nature of
the  hedge  changes  in the fair  value of  derivatives  either  will be offset
against  the  change in fair value of the hedged  assets  liabilities  or firm
commitments  through  earnings  or will be  recognized  in other  comprehensive
income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings  the ineffective portion
of a  derivatives  change  in fair  value  will be  immediately  recognized  in
earnings  in june of 1999 the financial  accounting standards board delayed the
effective date of implementation for one year therefore  sfas 133 is effective
for fiscal years beginning  after june 15 2000  trimble will adopt sfas 133 as
of the  beginning  of its fiscal year 2001  the effect of adopting the sfas 133
has been  evaluated  and does not have a material  adverse  effect on trimbles
financial position or results of operations

     in december 1999 the  securities  and exchange  commission  sec issued
staff  accounting   bulletin  sab  101  revenue  recognition  in  financial
statements  which  provides  guidance  related to revenue  recognition  based on
interpretations  and  practices  followed by the sec sab 101 was  effective the
first  fiscal  quarter of fiscal  years  beginning  after  december 15 1999 and
requires  companies to report any changes in revenue  recognition  as cumulative
change in accounting  principle at the time of implementation in accordance with
accounting principles board opinion no 20 accounting changes in march 2000
the  sec  issued  sab  101a   amendment   revenue   recognition  in  financial
statements  which delayed  implementation of sab 101 until the companys first
fiscal quarter of 2000 in june 2000 the sec issued sab 101b second amendment
revenue  recognition in financial  statements which delayed the implementation
of sab 101  until the  companys  fourth  fiscal  quarter  of 2000  sab 101 was
adopted by the company in the fourth fiscal  quarter of 2000 and it did not have
any  material  effect  on  the  companys   financial  position  or  results  of
operations



item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk

     the following is a discussion of trimbles  exposure to market risk related
to changes in interest rates and foreign currency  exchange rates  trimble uses
certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks trimble does not
use derivative  financial  instruments for speculative or trading purposes  all
financial  instruments are used in accordance with polices approved by trimbles
board of directors

market interest rate risk

     shortterm  investments  owned by the  company  as of december  29  2000
trimble had no shortterm investments

                                       34
page

     as of december  31  1999  trimble  had  shortterm  investments  of 527
million  these  shortterm  investments  consisted  of 502  million of highly
liquid  investments  with original  maturities at the date of purchase  between
three and twelve months and a 25 million  liquid  investment  with an original
maturity at the date of purchase of 15 months  see note 4 to the  consolidated
financial  statements these investments were subject to interest rate risk and
decreased in value if market interest rates increased a hypothetical 10 percent
increase in market interest rates from levels at december 31 1999  would cause
the fair value of these  shortterm  investments  to  decline  by an  immaterial
amount  because  trimble  had the  ability  to  hold  these  investments  until
maturity we did not expect the value of these investments to be affected to any
significant  degree by the effect of a sudden change in market  interest  rates
declines in interest rates over time will however reduce our interest income

     outstanding debt of the company  the company is exposed to market risk due
to the  possibility  of changing  interest  rates  under the new senior  secured
credit facilities the companys new credit facilities are comprised of a 3year
us dollaronly  revolver a 3year  multicurrency  revolver  and a 5year term
loan see note 2 to the consolidated  financial  statements  under  acquisition
financing the entire credit facility has interest payments based on a floating
rate of libor plus 275 basis points for the first 6 months and  thereafter  tied
to a formula  based on the  companys  leverage  ratio  the us  dollar  and the
multicurrency  revolvers run through july 2003 and have  outstanding  principle
balances at december 29 2000 of 50000000 and 12000000  respectively  as
of december 29 2000 the company has borrowed from the  multicurrency  revolver
in us currency only the term loan runs through july 2005 and has an outstanding
principle  balance of  100000000  at december  29  2000  the 3month  libor
effective rate at december 29 2000 was 6438  a 10 increase in 3month libor
rates could result in  approximately  10 million  annual  increase in interest
expense on the existing principal balances

     the company also has 71 million of eurodenominated debt at december 29
2000 37 million was current  the interest rate on the current portion of this
instrument is fixed at 6 a  hypothetical  10 decrease in interest rates would
not have a material impact on the company as related to this debt

     in  addition  the company has a 19  million  promissory  note  of which
67000  was  current  at  december  29  2000  the note is  payable in monthly
installments  bearing an 8940  variable  interest  rate a  hypothetical  10
increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company

     as of  december  31  1999  trimble  had  outstanding  longterm  debt  of
approximately 300 million of subordinated promissory notes at a fixed interest
rate of 10 the interest rate of this instrument was fixed a hypothetical  10
decrease  in the  interest  rates  would not have a material  impact on trimble
increases in interest rates could however increase interest expense associated
with future borrowings of trimble if any

     the company may consider  utilizing  interest rate swap agreements to alter
interest rate exposures there were no interest rate swap agreements outstanding
as of december 29 2000 or december 30 1999

foreign currency exchange rate risk

     trimble hedges risks associated with foreign currency transactions in order
to  minimize  the  impact of  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates on
earnings  trimble  utilizes  forward  contracts to hedge trade and intercompany
receivables and payables these contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in
exchange  rate  movements  as the  gains and  losses  associated  with  foreign
currency  balances are  generally  offset with the gains and losses on the hedge
contracts  all hedge  instruments  are marked to market through  earnings every
period

       trimble  does  not  anticipate  any  material   adverse  effect  on  its
consolidated financial position utilizing our current hedging strategy

     all  contracts  have a maturity of less than one year  and we do not defer
any gains and  losses  as they are all  accounted  for through  earnings  every
period
