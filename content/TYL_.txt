market overview 

the state and local government market is one of the largest and most decentralized it markets in the country consisting of all 50 states approximately 3000 counties 36000 cities and towns and 12900 school districts this market is also comprised of approximately 38000 special districts and other agencies each with specialized delegated responsibilities and unique information management requirements 

traditionally local government bodies and agencies performed statemandated duties including property assessment record keeping road maintenance law enforcement administration of election and judicial functions and the provision of welfare assistance today a host of emerging and urgent issues are confronting local governments each of which demands a service response these areas include criminal justice and corrections administration and finance public safety health and human services planning regulatory and maintenance and records and document management transfers of responsibility from the federal and state governments to county and municipal governments and agencies in these and other areas also place additional service and financial requirements on these local government units in addition constituents of local governments are increasingly demanding improved service and better access to information from public entities as a result local governments recognize the increasing value of information management systems and services to among other things improve revenue collection provide increased access to information and streamline delivery of services to their constituents local government bodies are now recognizing that “egovernment” is an additional responsibility for community development from integrated tax systems to integrated civil and criminal justice information systems many counties and cities have benefited significantly from the implementation of jurisdictionwide systems that allow different agencies or government offices to share data and provide a more comprehensive approach to information management many city and county governmental agencies also have unique individual information management requirements which must be tailored to the specific functions of each particular office 

many local governments also have difficulties attracting and retaining the staff necessary to support their it functions as a result they seek to establish longterm relationships with reliable providers of high quality it products and services such as tyler 

although local governments often face budgetary constraints in their operations their primary revenue sources are usually property taxes and to a lesser extent utility billings and other fees which historically tend to be relatively stable in addition the acquisition of new technology typically enables local governments to operate more efficiently more securely and often provides a measurable return on investment that justifies the purchase of software and related services

we derive our revenues from five primary sources 

• software licenses and royalties 

• subscriptionbased services 

• software services 

• maintenance and support 

• appraisal services 

software licenses and royalties 

many of our software arrangements involve “offtheshelf” software we recognize the revenue allocable to “offtheshelf” software licenses and specified upgrades at a point in time when control of the software license transfers to the customer unless the software is not considered distinct we consider offtheshelf software to be distinct when it can be added to an arrangement with minor changes in the underlying code it can be used by the customer for the customer’s purpose upon installation and remaining services such as training are not considered highly interdependent or interrelated to the products functionality 

for arrangements that involve significant production modification or customization of the software or where software services are otherwise not considered distinct we recognize revenue over time by measuring progresstocompletion we measure progresstocompletion primarily using labor hours incurred as it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts these arrangements are often implemented over an extended period and occasionally require us to revise total cost estimates amounts recognized in revenue are calculated using the progresstocompletion measurement after giving effect to any changes in our cost estimates changes to total estimated contract costs if any are recorded in the period they are determined estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which we first determine that a loss is apparent 

software license fees are billed in accordance with the contract terms typically a majority of the fee is due when access to the software license is made available to the customer and the remainder of the fee due over a passage of time stipulated by the contract we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 

we recognize royalty revenue when the sale occurs under the terms of our thirdparty royalty arrangements currently our thirdparty royalties are recognized on an estimated basis and adjusted if needed when we receive notice of amounts we are entitled to receive we typically receive notice of royalty revenues we are entitled to and billed on a quarterly basis in the quarter immediately following the royalty reporting period and adjustments have not been significant 

subscriptionbased services 

subscriptionbased revenue is primarily derived from our saas arrangements which generally utilize the tyler private cloud as well as our transactionbased offerings such as efiling solutions online dispute resolution solutions and online payment services 

we are able to provide the majority of our software products through our saas model the clients who choose this model typically do not wish to maintain update and operate these systems or make upfront capital expenditures to implement these advanced technologies the contract terms for these arrangements range from one to 10 years but are typically contracted for initial periods of three to five years the majority of our saas or hosting arrangements include additional professional services as well as maintenance and support services in certain arrangements the client may also acquire a license to the software 

as part of our subscriptionbased services we provide efiling solutions that simplify the filing and management of court related documents for courts and law offices revenues for efiling are included in subscriptionbased revenues and are derived from transaction fees and in some cases fixed fee arrangements other transactionbased fees primarily relate to digital government services and online payment services which are sometimes offered with the assistance of thirdparty vendors and online dispute resolution solutions 

software services 

we provide a variety of professional services to clients who utilize our software products virtually all of our clients contract with us for installation training and data conversion services in connection with their implementation of tyler’s software solutions the complete implementation process for a typical system includes planning design data conversion setup and testing at the culmination of the implementation process a data implementation team is generally onsite at the client’s facility or available via remote video conferencing to ensure the smooth golive with the new system implementation fees are charged separately to clients on either a fixedfee or hourly charge basis depending on the contract 

both in connection with the installation of new systems and on an ongoing basis we provide extensive training services and programs related to our products and services training can be provided in our training centers onsite at clients’ locations at meetings and conferences or remotely and can be customized to meet clients’ requirements the vast majority of our clients contract with us for training services both to improve their employees’ proficiency and productivity and to fully utilize the functionality of our systems training services are generally billed on an hourly or daily basis along with travel and other expenses 

maintenance and support 

following the implementation of our software systems we provide ongoing software support services to assist our clients in operating the systems and to periodically update the software support is provided to clients over the phone or via the web through help desks staffed by our client support representatives for more complicated issues our staff with the clients permission can log on to clients’ systems remotely we maintain our clients’ software largely through releases that contain improvements and incremental additions of features and functionality along with updates necessary because of legislative or regulatory changes 

virtually all of our software clients contract with us for maintenance and support which provides us with a significant source of recurring revenue we generally provide maintenance and support for our onpremises clients under annual or in some cases multiyear contracts with a typical fee based on a percentage of the software product’s license fee these fees can generally be increased on renewal and may also increase as new license fees increase maintenance and support fees are generally paid annually in advance most maintenance contracts automatically renew unless the client or tyler gives notice of termination prior to expiration similar support is provided to our saas clients and is included in their subscription fees which are classified as subscriptionbased revenues 

appraisal services 

we are the nation’s largest provider of property appraisal outsourcing services for local government taxing authorities these services include 

• the physical inspection of commercial and residential properties 

• data collection and processing 

• sophisticated computer analyses for property valuation 

• preparation of tax rolls 

• community education regarding the assessment process 

• arbitration between taxpayers and the assessing jurisdiction 

local government taxing authorities normally reappraise properties from time to time to update values for tax assessment purposes and to maintain equity in the taxing process in some jurisdictions law mandates reassessment cycles in others they are discretionary while some taxing jurisdictions perform reappraisals inhouse many local governments outsource this function because of its cyclical nature and because of the specialized knowledge and expertise requirements associated with it our appraisal services business unit has operated in this business since 1938 

in some instances we also provide property tax and  or appraisal software products in connection with appraisal outsourcing projects while other clients may only engage us to provide appraisal services appraisal outsourcing services are somewhat seasonal in nature to the extent that winter weather conditions reduce the productivity of data collection activities in connection with those projects 

strategy 

our objective is to grow our revenue and earnings organically supplemented by focused strategic acquisitions the key components of our business strategy are to 

• provide high quality value–added products and services to our clients  we compete on the basis of among other things delivering to clients our deep domain expertise in government operations through the highest value products and services in the market we believe we have achieved a reputation as a premium product and service provider to the government market 

• continue to expand our product and service offerings  while we already have what we believe to be the broadest line of software products for local governments we continually upgrade our core software applications and expand our complementary product and service offerings to respond to technological advancements and the changing needs of our clients we regularly add new products and services to our portfolio through internal product development as well as acquisitions we believe that the addition of new features and applications enhances the market appeal of our core products we have also broadened our offerings of consulting and business process reengineering services 

• accelerate our move to the cloud  we have offered most of our core products in both an onpremises license model and a cloudbased subscription model for several years and have seen a steady increase in the percentage of new software clients choosing our cloud model in recent years beginning in late 2019 we moved our approach to sales from “cloudneutral” to “cloudfirst” with an increasing preference to provide our solutions in the cloud we are making significant investments in optimizing our products to be deployed efficiently in the public cloud and over a multiyear period are transitioning from hosting clients in tyler’s own data centers to utilizing amazon web services “aws” for cloud hosting 

• expand our client base  we seek to establish longterm relationships with new clients primarily through our sales and marketing efforts while we currently have clients in all 50 states canada the caribbean the united kingdom australia and other international locations some of our solutions have not fully achieved nationwide geographic penetration we intend to continue to expand into new geographic markets by adding sales staff and targeting marketing efforts by solutions in those areas we also intend to continue to expand our customer base to include larger jurisdictions while our traditional market focus has primarily been on small and midsized governments our increased size and market presence together with the technological advances and improved scalability of certain of our solutions are allowing us to achieve increasing success in selling to larger clients we also expect to expand our presence in international markets by leveraging our leadership position in the united states through the disciplined pursuit of selected opportunities in other countries 

• expand our existing client relationships  our existing customer base offers significant opportunities for additional sales of solutions and services that we currently offer but that existing clients do not fully utilize addon sales to existing clients typically involve lower sales and marketing expenses than sales to new clients in particular we believe that the acquisition of nic in april 2021 provides us with significant opportunities to sell tyler software products into nic’s client base and to provide nic’s payment services to tyler’s client base 

• grow recurring revenues  we have a large recurring revenue base from maintenance and support and subscriptionbased services which generated revenues of 13 billion or 79 of total revenues in 2021 we have historically experienced very low customer turnover approximately 2 annually and recurring revenues continue to grow as the installed customer base increases subscriptionbased revenues have been our fastest growing revenue category over the past five years increasing from 1735 million in 2017 to 7844 million in 2021 

• maximize economies of scale and take advantage of financial leverage in our business  we seek to build and maintain a larger client base to create economies of scale enabling us to provide valueadded products and services to our clients while expanding our operating margins in addition we believe that we have a marketing and administrative infrastructure in place that can be leveraged to accommodate significant longterm growth without proportionately increasing selling general and administrative expenses 

• attract and retain highly qualified employees  we believe that the depth and quality of our management and staff is one of our significant strengths and that the ability to retain such employees is crucial to our continued growth and success we believe that our stable management team financial strength and growth opportunities as well as our leadership position in the public sector market enhance our attractiveness as an employer for highly skilled employees 

• pursue strategic acquisitions  we selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that provide us with one or more of the following 

• new products and services to complement our existing offerings 

• entry into new markets related to the public sector 

• new clients andor geographic expansion 

• establish strategic alliances  in october 2019 we announced a strategic collaboration agreement with amazon web services aws for cloud hosting services this agreement brings together tyler the nations largest software company exclusively focused on the public sector and aws the broadest and deepest cloud platform specifically the agreement with aws provides the framework for development training and collaboration in order to support nextgeneration applications that have the scalability resiliency and security aws offers aws is assisting us in accelerating innovation and the development of strategic initiatives these initiatives will bring the most advanced cloudnative services to tyler clients improving the flow of information and providing a better experience for state local and federal governments 

sales marketing and clients 

we market our products and services primarily through direct sales and marketing personnel located throughout the united states other inhouse sales staff focus on addon sales professional services and support for certain products we also utilize a partner network for both sales and professional services primarily in the state and federal markets 

sales of new systems are typically generated from referrals from other government offices or departments within a county or municipality referrals from other local governments relationships established between sales representatives and county or local officials contacts at trade shows direct mailings and direct contact from prospects already familiar with us we are active in numerous national state county and local government associations and participate in annual meetings trade shows and educational events 

clients consist primarily of federal state county and municipal agencies school districts and other local government offices in counties clients include the auditor treasurer tax assessorcollector county clerk district clerk county and district court judges probation officers sheriff and county appraiser at municipal government sites clients include directors from various departments including administration finance utilities public works code enforcement personnel purchasing taxation municipal court and police at the state and federal levels clients include chief information officers and agency heads contracts for software products and services are generally implemented over periods of three months to one year although some complex implementations may span multiple years with annually renewing maintenance and support update agreements thereafter although either the client or we can terminate these agreements historically almost all support and maintenance agreements are automatically renewed annually during 2021 approximately 30 of our revenue was attributable to ongoing support and maintenance agreements 

competition 

we compete with numerous local regional and national firms that provide or offer some or many of the same solutions and services that we provide many of these competitors are smaller companies that may offer less expensive solutions than ours many of these firms operate within a specific geographic area and  or in a narrow product or service niche we also compete with national firms some of which have greater financial and technical resources than we do including oracle corporation infor sap ag workday inc centralsquare technologies thomson reuters corporation motorola solutions inc axon enterprise inc and constellation software inc in addition we sometimes compete with consulting and systems integration firms which develop custom systems primarily for larger governments we also occasionally compete with central internal information service departments of governments which requires us to persuade the enduser department to discontinue service by its own personnel and outsource the service to us 

we compete on a variety of factors including price service name recognition reputation technological capabilities and the ability to modify existing products and services to accommodate the individual requirements of the client our ability to offer an integrated system of applications for several offices or departments is often a competitive advantage governmental units often are required to seek competitive proposals through a request for proposal process and some prospective clients use consultants to assist them with the proposal and vendor selection process 

suppliers 

substantially all of the computers peripherals printers scanners operating system software office automation software and other equipment necessary for the implementation and provision of our software systems and services are presently available from several thirdparty sources hardware is purchased on original equipment manufacturer or distributor terms at discounts from retail we have not experienced any significant supply problems 

backlog 

at december 31 2021 our revenue backlog was approximately 180 billion compared to 159 billion at december 31 2020 the backlog generally represents signed contracts under which the revenue has not been recognized approximately 840 million or 47 of the backlog is expected to be recognized during 2022 

intellectual property proprietary rights and licenses 

we regard certain features of our internal operations software and documentation as confidential and proprietary and rely on a combination of contractual restrictions trade secret laws and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property we generally do not rely on patents we believe that due to the rapid rate of technological change in the computer software industry trade secrets and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as knowledge ability and experience of our employees frequent product enhancements and timeliness and quality of support services we typically license our software products under nonexclusive license agreements which are generally nontransferable and have a perpetual term 

human capital resources 

human capital

an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk investors evaluating our company should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this annual report any of the following factors could materially harm our business operating results and financial condition additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business operating results and financial condition this section should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report we may make forwardlooking statements from time to time both written and oral we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forwardlooking statements our actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forwardlooking statements due to a number of factors including those set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report 

risks associated with our business including our software products 

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities can disrupt our business and harm our competitive position 

threats to it security can take a variety of forms individuals and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations including statesponsored organizations may take steps that pose threats to our clients and our it they may for example develop and deploy malicious software to attack our products and services andor gain access to our networks and data centers or act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks cyber threats are constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and clients breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications impair our ability to provide services to our clients and protect the privacy of their data result in product development delays compromise confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or otherwise adversely affect our business our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these evolving threats despite the network and application security internal control measures and physical security procedures we employ to safeguard our systems we may still be vulnerable to a security breach intrusion loss or theft of confidential client data and transaction data or proprietary company information which may harm our business reputation and future financial results the lost revenue and containment remediation investigation legal and other costs 

could be significant and may exceed our insurance policy limits or may not be covered by insurance at all further we may be subject to regulatory enforcement actions and litigation that could result in financial judgments or the payment of settlement amounts and disputes with insurance carriers concerning coverage 

in september 2020 we filed a current report on form 8k reporting a security incident the incident involving ransomware disrupting access to some of our internal it systems and telephone systems we promptly notified our clients of the incident and provided timely updates to our clients through direct communications and updates to our website there is no evidence that the environments where we host client applications were affected and our hosting services to those clients were not interrupted there was also no evidence of malicious activity on client networks associated with the incident we contained the incident and recovered from it resuming normal operations with our clients we deployed supplemental remediation efforts as necessary and cooperated with law enforcement’s investigation 

although we completed our investigation into the incident and believe we contained and recovered from the incident we are subject to risk and uncertainties as a result of the incident there can be no assurance as to what the ongoing impact of the incident will be if any we maintain cybersecurity insurance coverage in an amount that we believe is adequate 

disclosure of personally identifiable information andor other sensitive client data could result in liability and harm our reputation 

we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information and other confidential information of our clients the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security despite our efforts to improve security controls it is possible our security controls over personal data our training of employees on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of sensitive client data that we store and manage disclosure of personally identifiable information andor other sensitive client data could result in liability and harm our reputation 

we depend on third parties with whom we engage or collaborate for certain projects deliverables andor financial transaction processes if these parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us or we are unable to maintain these relationships our operating results and business prospects could be adversely affected 

to satisfy our obligations under client contracts we often engage third parties to provide certain deliverables or fulfill certain requirements we may also use third parties to ensure that our services and solutions integrate with the software systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers our ability to serve our clients and deliver our solutions in a timely manner depends on our ability to retain and maintain relationships with thirdparty vendors and service providers and the ability of these third parties to meet their obligations in a timely manner as well as on our effective oversight of their performance if any third party fails to perform on a timely basis the agreedupon services our ability to fulfill our obligations may be jeopardized thirdparty performance deficiencies could result in breaches of our obligations with respect to or the termination for default of one or more of our client contracts a breach or termination for default could expose us to liability for damages and have an adverse effect on our business prospects results of operations cash flows and financial condition and our ability to compete for future contracts and orders a global economic slowdown the covid19 pandemic or similar circumstances could also adversely affect the businesses of our thirdparty providers hindering their ability to provide the services on which we rely our agreements with third parties typically are nonexclusive and do not prohibit them from working with our competitors if we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these third parties our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenues could be impaired and our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected 

in addition we may act as subcontractor to a thirdparty prime contractor to secure new projects subcontracting arrangements where we are not the prime contractor pose unique risks to us because we may not have control over the customer relationship and our ability to generate revenue under such subcontracts may depend on the prime contractor its performance and relationship with the customer and its relationship with us we could suffer losses in the event a prime contract under which we serve as a subcontractor is terminated whether for nonperformance by the prime contractor or otherwise upon a termination of the prime contract our subcontract would similarly terminate and the resulting contract loss could have an adverse effect on our business prospects results of operations cash flows and financial condition and our ability to compete for future contracts and orders 

we rely on thirdparty providers—including amazon web services—for hosting services and other technologyrelated services needed to deliver certain of our cloud solutions any disruption in the services provided by such thirdparty providers could adversely affect our business and subject us to liability 

a material portion of our business is provided through software hosting services which are sometimes hosted from and use computing infrastructure provided by third parties including amazon web services these hosting services depend on the uninterrupted operation of data centers and the ability to protect computer equipment and information stored in these data centers against damage that may be caused by natural disaster fire power loss telecommunications or internet failure acts of terrorism unauthorized intrusion computer viruses and other similar damaging events if any of our data centers were to become inoperable for an extended period we might be unable to fulfill our contractual commitments although we take what we believe to be reasonable precautions against such occurrences we can give no assurance that damaging events such as these will not result in a prolonged interruption of our services which could result in client dissatisfaction loss of revenue and damage to our business 

thirdparty hosting service providers have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all if we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms we may be required to transition to a new provider and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with doing so in addition such service providers could decide to close their facilities or change or suspend their service offerings without adequate notice to us moreover any financial difficulties such as bankruptcy faced by such service providers may have negative effects on our business the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict because we cannot easily switch thirdparty hosting service providers any disruption with respect to our current providers would impact our operations and our business could be adversely impacted problems faced by our hosting service providers could adversely affect the experience of our customers for example amazon web services has experienced significant service outages in the past and may do so again in the future in addition the ongoing covid19 pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt the supply chain of hardware needed to maintain these thirdparty systems or to run our business 

material portions of our business require the internet infrastructure to be reliable 

part of our future success continues to depend on the use of the internet as a means to access public information and perform transactions electronically including for example electronic filing of court documents this in part requires ongoing maintenance of the internet infrastructure especially to prevent interruptions in service as well as additional development of that infrastructure this requires a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed data capacity security and timely development of complementary products for providing reliable internet access and services if this infrastructure fails to be sufficiently developed or be adequately maintained our business would be harmed because users may not be able to access our government portals 

we employ thirdparty licensed software and software components for use in or with our solutions and the inability to maintain these licenses or the presence of errors or security vulnerabilities in the software we license could limit the functionality of our products and result in increased costs or reduced service levels which would adversely affect our business 

we incorporate and include thirdparty software into and with certain of our products and solutions we also use thirdparty software and tools in certain areas of the development process for our solutions we anticipate that we will continue to rely on such thirdparty software and development tools in the future in addition there can be no assurance that these third parties will continue to make their software or tools available to us on acceptable terms or at all not make their products available to our competitors on more favorable terms invest the appropriate levels of resources in their products and services to maintain and enhance the capabilities of their software or remain in business any impairment in our relationship with these third parties or our ability to license or otherwise use their software or tools could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flow and financial condition although we believe that there are commercially reasonable alternatives to the thirdparty software and tools we currently license this may not always be the case or they may be difficult timeconsuming or costly to replace in addition although we maintain a supplier security evaluation process if the thirdparty software or tools we use has or have errors security vulnerabilities or otherwise malfunctions the functionality of our solutions may be negatively impacted our customers may experience reduced service levels and our business may suffer 

certain of our solutions utilize open source software and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could adversely affect our business 

certain of our solutions include software covered by open source licenses the terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market our solutions it is possible under the terms of certain open source licenses if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner that we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software and make our proprietary software available under open source licenses in the event that portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an open source license we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code reengineer all or a portion of our solutions or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our solutions each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our solutions in addition to risks related to license requirements use of open source 

software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software many of the risks associated with the use of open source software cannot be eliminated and could adversely affect our business 

we run the risk of errors or defects with new products or enhancements to existing products 

our software products are complex and may contain errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released any such defects could result in a loss of revenues or delay market acceptance our license agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability however it is possible we may not always successfully negotiate such provisions in our client contracts or the limitation of liability provisions may not be effective due to existing or future federal state or local laws ordinances or judicial decisions although we maintain errors and omissions and general liability insurance and we try to structure contracts to limit liability we cannot assure you that a successful claim could not be made or would not have a material adverse effect on our future operating results 

we must timely respond to technological changes to be competitive 

the market for our products is characterized by technological change evolving industry standards in software technology changes in client requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments satisfy increasingly sophisticated client requirements and achieve market acceptance we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and costeffective manner the products capabilities or technologies developed by others could also render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to develop or acquire new software products or develop enhancements to existing products on a timely and costeffective basis or if such new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance 

we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights 

many of our product and service offerings incorporate proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of contracts copyrights and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology we cannot be certain that we have taken all appropriate steps to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property there has also been an apparent evolution in the legal standards and regulations courts and the us patent office may apply in favorably evaluating software patent rights we are not currently involved in any material intellectual property litigation however we may be a party to such litigation in the future to protect our proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us with respect to current or future products any claims or litigation with or without merit could be timeconsuming costly and a diversion to management any such claims and litigation could also cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements such royalty or licensing arrangements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all therefore litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business regardless of the final outcome of such litigation 

clients may elect to terminate our maintenance contracts and manage operations internally 

it is possible that our clients may elect to not renew maintenance contracts for our software trying instead to maintain and operate the software themselves using their perpetual license rights excluding software applications that we provide on a hosted or cloud basis alternatively clients may elect to drop maintenance on certain modules that they ultimately decide not to use this could adversely affect our revenues and profits additionally they may inadvertently allow our intellectual property or other information to fall into the hands of third parties including our competitors which could adversely affect our business 

risks associated with selling products and services into the public sector marketplace 

selling products and services into the public sector poses unique challenges 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of software and services to state county and city governments other federal or municipal agencies and other public entities we expect that sales to public sector clients will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues in the future we face many risks and challenges associated with contracting with governmental entities including 

• resource limitations caused by budgetary constraints which may provide for a termination of executed contracts due to a lack of future funding 

• long and complex sales cycles 

• contract payments at times being subject to achieving implementation milestones and we may have differences with clients as to whether milestones have been achieved 

• political resistance to the concept of contracting with third parties to provide it solutions 

• legislative changes affecting a local government’s authority to contract with third parties 

• varying bid procedures and internal processes for bid acceptance 

• various other political factors including changes in governmental administrations and personnel 

each of these risks is outside our control if we fail to adequately adapt to these risks and uncertainties our financial performance could be adversely affected 

covid19 may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we expect that the continued global spread of covid19 may negatively impact our business and financial results in fiscal year 2022 as the virus continues to spread it has resulted in authorities implementing ongoing measures to contain the virus including travel bans and restrictions quarantines and business limitations and shutdowns while we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that covid19 will continue to have on our results from operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties including the duration and severity of the pandemic and containment measures and associated compliance we do expect the pandemic may negatively impact our revenues and other financial results 

because an increasing portion of our revenues are recurring the effect of covid19 on our results of operations may also not be fully reflected for some time we may see some more immediate impact on our business should there be new delays in government procurement processes and uncertainty around public sector budgets or new delays in implementations caused by travel restrictions closed offices or clients shifting focus to more pressing issues 

appraisal and software implementations projects may be delayed if clients put projects on hold or slow projects by extending golive dates while we have the ability to deliver most of our professional services remotely some of our professional services including appraisal assessments are more effective when performed onsite and certain clients may continue to insist on onsite services in any event in addition our delivery of some professional services requires the availability of client personnel there may be a negative impact on our revenues if we are unable to deliver these services also we expect software licenses and subscriptions revenues to be negatively affected if there are delays in procurement processes some clients could request changes to payment terms negatively impacting the timing of collections of accounts receivables in future periods for the twelve months ended december 31 2021 79 of our total revenue and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription and maintenance revenue which is recurring in nature thus the effect of the covid19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial performance until future periods 

we have historically evaluated goodwill for impairment annually as of april 1 or more frequently if impairment indicators arose during the second quarter 2021 we voluntarily changed the date of our annual assessment of goodwill to october 1 for all reporting units the change in testing date for goodwill impairment is a change in accounting principle which management believes is preferable as the new date of the assessment better aligns with our annual planning process subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results changes in management’s business strategy an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace an inability to successfully achieve internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price which may represent an indicator of impairment the occurrence of any of these events which could be caused or impacted by the covid19 pandemic may require us to record future goodwill impairment charges 

a prolonged economic slowdown could harm our operations 

a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce demand for our software products and services governments may face financial pressures that could in turn affect our growth rate and profitability in the future there is no assurance that government spending levels will be unaffected by declining or stagnant general economic conditions and if budget shortfalls occur they may negatively impact government it spending and could adversely affect our business 

the open bidding process creates uncertainty in predicting future contract awards 

many governmental agencies purchase products and services through an open bidding process generally a governmental entity will publish an established list of requirements requesting potential vendors to propose solutions for the established requirements to respond successfully to these requests for proposals we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract the time required to establish operations for the proposed client and the likely terms of any other thirdparty proposals submitted we cannot guarantee that we will win any bids in the future through the request for proposal process or that any winning bids will ultimately result in contracts on favorable terms our failure to secure contracts through the open bidding process or to secure such contracts on favorable terms may adversely affect our revenue and gross margins 

we face significant competition from other vendors and potential new entrants into our markets 

we believe we are a leading provider of integrated solutions for the public sector however we face competition from a variety of software vendors that offer products and services similar to those offered by us as well as from companies offering to develop custom software we compete based on a number of factors including 

• the attractiveness of our “evergreen” business model 

• the breadth depth and quality of our product and service offerings 

• the ability to modify our offerings to accommodate particular clients’ needs 

• technological innovation 

• name recognition reputation and references 

• price 

• our financial strength and stability 

our market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors that vary in size product platform and product scope our competitors include consulting firms publicly held companies that focus on selected segments of the public sector market and a significant number of smaller privately held companies certain competitors have greater technical marketing and financial resources than we do we cannot assure you that such competitors will not develop products or offer services that are superior to our products or services or that achieve greater market acceptance 

we also compete with internal centralized it departments of governmental entities which requires us to persuade the enduser to stop the internal service and outsource to us in addition our clients and prospective clients could elect to provide information management services internally through new or existing departments which could reduce the market for our services 

we could face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the public sector software market and new products and technologies are introduced increased competition could result in pricing pressure fewer client orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective clients it is possible that new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect upon our business 

fixedprice contracts may affect our profits 

some of our contracts are structured on a fixedprice basis which can lead to various risks including 

• the failure to accurately estimate the resources and time required for an engagement 

• the failure to effectively manage our clients’ expectations regarding the scope of services delivered for a fixed fee 

• the failure to timely and satisfactorily complete fixedprice engagements within budget 

if we do not adequately assess and manage these and other risks we may be subject to cost overruns and penalties which may harm our financial performance 

changes in the insurance markets may affect our business 

some of our clients primarily those for our property appraisal services require that we secure performance bonds before they will select us as their vendor in addition we have in the past been required to provide letters of credit as security for the issuance of a performance bond we cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure such performance bonds in the future on terms that are favorable to us if at all our inability to obtain performance bonds on favorable terms or at all could impact our future ability to win some contract awards particularly large property appraisal services contracts which could negatively impact revenues in addition the general insurance markets may experience volatility andor restrictive coverage trends which may lead to future increases in our general and administrative expenses and negatively impact our operating results 

risks related to our indebtedness 

servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness and we may not otherwise have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle for cash conversions of the convertible senior notes or to repurchase the convertible senior notes upon a fundamental change or to repay our indebtedness obligations under our 2021 credit agreement each of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

as of december 31 2021 we had outstanding an aggregate principal amount of 600 million of our convertible senior notes and 755 million under our 2021 credit agreement in april 2021 we entered into the 2021 credit agreement with significantly increased borrowing capacity of up to 14 billion and on the closing of the acquisition of nic on april 21 2021 we borrowed initial loans in 

the aggregate principal amount of 115 billion the 2021 credit agreement also has an option to increase the amount available up to an additional 500 million subject to our leverage and other factors the proceeds from the issuance of our convertible senior notes and from loans under the 2021 credit agreement were used as sources of funding for the acquisition of nic our indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry conditions and we and our subsidiaries may subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness incur additional debt secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt if we incur additional indebtedness the risks related to our business would increase and our ability to service or repay our indebtedness may be adversely impacted 

pursuant to their terms holders may convert their convertible senior notes at their option prior to the scheduled maturities of their convertible senior notes under certain circumstances upon conversion of the convertible senior notes unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share we will be obligated to make cash payments in addition holders of our convertible senior notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their convertible senior notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture dated as of march 9 2021 between the company and us bank national association as trustee the “trustee” the “indenture” at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the convertible senior notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest if any although it is our intention and we currently expect to have the ability to settle the convertible senior notes in cash there is a risk that we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of convertible senior notes surrendered or convertible senior notes being converted in addition our ability to make payments may be limited by law by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness our failure to repurchase convertible senior notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the convertible senior notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture a default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our other existing or future indebtedness if the repayment of other indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods we may not have sufficient funds to repay the other indebtedness and repurchase the convertible senior notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof 

our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due or to make payments upon conversion or repurchase demands with respect to our convertible senior notes or to refinance our indebtedness as we may need or desire depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures selling assets refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms which could result in a default on our existing or future indebtedness and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

covenant restrictions under our indebtedness may limit our ability to operate our business and may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and earnings per share 

the indenture governing the notes and the 2021 credit agreement do and our future indebtedness agreements may contain covenants that may restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities subject to customary carveouts thresholds and baskets the 2021 credit agreement and the indenture by means of a crossdefault restricts absent consent of the agent and lenders under the 2021 credit agreement our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to among other things 

• incur additional indebtedness 

• permit liens on our assets 

• make certain investments acquisitions and dispositions 

• make certain specified fundamental changes and 

• make certain restricted payments 

in addition the 2021 credit agreement and the indenture by means of a crossdefault contains other customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default the 2021 credit agreement is unsecured but requires us to maintain certain financial ratios regarding our total leverage and interest coverage and other financial conditions in addition to the restrictions described above events beyond our control including changes in general economic and business conditions may result in a breach of any of these covenants and result in a default under the 2021 credit agreement that may in turn result in a default under the indenture if an event of default under the 2021 credit agreement occurs the lenders could terminate all commitments to lend and elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable if we were unable to pay such amounts the lenders could proceed against the guarantees by our direct and indirect material domestic subsidiaries should the lenders proceed 

against the guarantees we cannot give assurance that we would have sufficient assets to pay amounts due on the 2021 credit agreement and the convertible senior notes 

variable rate indebtedness subjects the company to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

our borrowings under the 2021 credit agreement are and are expected to continue to be at variable rates of interest and expose tyler to interest rate risk if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income would decrease revolving credit facility loans and term a1 loans under the 2021 credit agreement bear interest at a per annum rate equal to at our option either 1 the administrative agent’s prime commercial lending rate subject to certain higher rate determinations the “base rate” plus a margin of 0125 to 075 or 2 the one three six or subject to approval by all lenders twelvemonth libor rate plus a margin of 1125 to 175 our term a2 loans bear interest at our option at a per annum rate of either 1 the base rate plus a margin of 000 to 050 or 2 the one three six or subject to approval by all lenders twelvemonth libor rate plus a margin of 0875 to 150 the margin in each case is based upon our total net leverage ratio as determined pursuant to the 2021 credit agreement based on the debt under the 2021 credit agreement the aggregate principal outstanding balance as of december 31 2021 is 7550 million and each quarter point change in interest rates would result in a 19 million change in annual interest expense 

the conditional conversion feature of the convertible senior notes if triggered may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in the event the conditional conversion feature of the notes is triggered holders of our convertible senior notes will be entitled to convert the convertible senior notes at any time during specified periods at their option if one or more holders elect to convert their convertible senior notes unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash which could adversely affect our liquidity in addition even if holders do not elect to convert their convertible senior notes we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than longterm liability which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital 

transactions relating to our convertible senior notes may affect the value of our common stock 

our convertible senior notes may become convertible in the future at the option of their holders under certain circumstances if holders of our convertible senior notes elect to convert their notes we may settle our conversion obligation by delivering to them a significant number of shares of our common stock which would cause dilution to our existing shareholders 

risks associated with our periodic results and stock price 

fluctuations in quarterly revenue could adversely impact our operating results and stock price 

our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter for a variety of reasons including 

• the size of license transactions can vary significantly 

• clients may unexpectedly postpone or cancel procurement processes due to changes in strategic priorities project objectives budget or personnel 

• client purchasing processes vary significantly and a client’s internal approval expenditure authorization and contract negotiation processes can be difficult and time consuming to complete even after selection of a vendor 

• the number timing and significance of software product enhancements and new software product announcements by us and our competitors may affect purchase decisions 

• we may have to defer revenues under our revenue recognition policies and gaap 

• clients may elect subscriptionbased arrangements which result in lower software license revenues in the initial year as compared to traditional onpremise software license arrangements but generate higher recurring revenues over the term of the contract 

in each fiscal quarter our expense levels operating costs and hiring plans are based to some extent on projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed if our actual revenues fall below expectations we could experience a reduction in operating results also if actual revenues or earnings for any given quarter fall below expectations it may lead to a decline in our stock price 

increases in investment in research and development could decrease overall margins 

an important element of our corporate strategy is to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development and related product and service opportunities both through internal investments and the acquisition of intellectual property from companies that we have acquired we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position and research and development expenses could adversely affect operating margins 

our stock price may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile examples of factors that may significantly impact our stock price include 

• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results 

• announcements of technological innovations new products or new contracts by us or our competitors 

• developments with respect to patents copyrights or other proprietary rights 

• conditions and trends in the software and other technology industries 

• changes in financial estimates by securities analysts 

• general market conditions and other factors 

in addition the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of technology company stocks and may in the future adversely affect the market price of our stock sometimes securities class action litigation is filed following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities we cannot assure you that similar litigation will not occur in the future with respect to us such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect upon our financial performance 

our financial outlook may not be realized 

from time to time in press releases and otherwise we may publish forecasts or other forwardlooking statements regarding our results including estimated revenues or earnings any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties and as a matter of course any number of them may prove to be incorrect further the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors including those described in this discussion many of which are beyond our control as a result we cannot be certain that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse current and potential stockholders are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions but instead are encouraged to utilize our entire publicly available mix of historical and forwardlooking information as well as other available information regarding us our products and services and the software industry when evaluating our prospective results of operations 

risks associated with our growth strategy and other general corporate risks 

we may experience difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy 

a material portion of our historical growth has resulted from strategic acquisitions although our focus is on internal growth we will continue to identify and pursue strategic acquisitions with suitable candidates these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including risks that a transaction does not advance our business strategy that we do not achieve the expected return on our investment that we have difficulty integrating business systems and technology that we have difficulty retaining or integrating new employees that the transactions distract management from our other businesses that we acquire unforeseen liabilities and other unanticipated events our future success will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate future acquisitions into our operations it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits of these transactions such as increased revenue enhanced efficiencies or increased market share or the benefits may be ultimately less than we expected although we conduct due diligence reviews of potential acquisition candidates we may not identify all material liabilities or risks related to acquisition candidates there can be no assurance that any such strategic acquisitions will be accomplished on favorable terms or will result in profitable operations 

our failure to properly manage growth could adversely affect our business 

we continue to expand our operations by pursuing existing and potential market opportunities this growth places significant demands on management and operational resources in order to manage growth effectively we must implement and improve our operational systems procedures and controls on a timely basis if we fail to implement these systems our business may be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to hire integrate and retain qualified personnel 

our continued success will depend upon the availability and performance of our key management sales marketing client support and product development personnel the loss of key management or technical personnel could adversely affect us we believe that our continued success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract integrate and retain such personnel we have at times experienced and continue to experience challenges in recruiting qualified personnel competition for qualified software development sales and other personnel is intense and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel in addition competitive job markets may increase our costs relating to compensation packages due to higher salary expectations and pressures 

compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance may result in additional expenses 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance compliance and public disclosure can create uncertainty for public companies the costs required to comply with such evolving laws across the various states and at the federal level are difficult to predict andor harmonize to maintain high standards of corporate governance compliance and public disclosure we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards this investment may result in an unforeseen increase in general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenuegenerating activities which may harm our operating results 

we don’t foresee paying dividends on our common stock 

we have not declared nor paid a cash dividend since we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector in 1998 we intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law could deter takeover attempts 

our board of directors may issue up to 1000000 shares of preferred stock and may determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting and conversion rights of these preferred shares these determinations may be made without any further vote or action by our stockholders the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock in addition some provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and the delaware general corporation law could also delay prevent or make more difficult a merger tender offer or proxy contest involving us

2021 operating results 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2021 total revenues increased 426 compared to the prior year excluding the impact of acquisitions total revenues increased 89 compared to prior year revenues from acquisitions contributed 337 of growth for the twelve months ended december 31 2021 

subscriptions revenue grew 1237 for the twelve months ended december 31 2021 due to an ongoing shift toward a cloudbased software as a service business model as well as the inclusion of transactionbased revenues from nic’s digital government and payments processing businesses excluding the impact of recent acquisitions subscriptions revenue increased 234 for the twelve months ended december 31 2021 

our backlog at december 31 2021 was 180 billion a 126 increase from last year 

we monitor and analyze several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance these indicators include the following 

revenues – we derive our revenues from five primary sources sale of software licenses and royalties subscriptionbased arrangements software services maintenance and appraisal services subscriptions and maintenance are considered recurring revenue sources and comprised approximately 791 of our revenue in 2021 the number of new saas clients and the number of existing clients who convert from our traditional software arrangements to our saas model are a significant driver of our revenue growth together with new software license sales and maintenance rate increases in addition we also monitor our customer base and turnover which historically is very low during 2021 based on our number of customers turnover was approximately 2 

cost of revenues and gross margins – our primary cost component is personnel expenses in connection with providing software implementation subscriptionbased services maintenance and support and appraisal services to our clients we can improve gross margins by controlling headcount and related costs and by expanding our revenue base especially from those products and services that produce incremental revenue with minimal incremental cost such as software licenses and royalties subscriptionbased services and maintenance and support our appraisal projects are cyclical in nature and we often employ appraisal personnel on a shortterm basis to coincide with the life of a project as of december 31 2021 our total employee count increased to 6778 from 5536 at december 31 2020 including 1063 employees who joined tyler through acquisitions in 2021 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses – the primary components of sga expenses are administrative and sales personnel salaries and commissions sharebased compensation expense marketing expense rent and professional fees sales commissions typically fluctuate with revenues and sharebased compensation expense generally increases as the market price of our stock increases other administrative expenses tend to grow at a slower rate than revenues 

liquidity and cash flows – the primary driver of our cash flows is net income uses of cash include acquisitions capital investments in property and equipment and discretionary purchases of treasury stock our working capital needs are fairly stable throughout the year with the significant components of cash outflows being payment of personnel expenses offset by cash inflows representing collection of accounts receivable and cash receipts from clients in advance of revenue being earned in recent years we have also received significant amounts of cash from employees exercising stock options and contributing to our employee stock purchase plan 

balance sheet – cash accounts receivable and days sales outstanding and deferred revenue balances are important indicators of our business 

impacts of the covid19 pandemic 

although market activity improved throughout 2021 in most sectors of our business and continues to trend to near or above prepandemic levels the pandemic continues to delay some government procurement processes and is expected to impact our ability to complete certain implementations negatively impacting our revenue we continue to monitor these trends in order to respond to the everchanging impact of covid19 on our clients and tyler’s operations 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2021 excluding the impact of 2021 acquisitions the impact of the covid19 pandemic resulted in lower revenues from software services software services revenues have been affected by a decline in billable travel revenue as most services are now being delivered virtually rather than onsite lower revenues compared to prior periods were partially offset by continued cost savings attributed to lower spend on travel and user conferences and trade show expenses as travel restrictions are relaxed software services and appraisal services revenues are increasing also we have adapted the way we do business by encouraging web and video conferencing conducting virtual sales demonstrations and delivering professional services remotely which result in increases in staff utilization rates and billable time 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2021 total revenues include covidrelated subscriptions revenue and software services revenues of 750 million from nics tourhealth pandemic unemployment services and virginia rent relief offerings we currently expect that these low margin covidrelated revenues from tourhealth and pandemic unemployment will wind down in the first half of 2022 while revenues from the virginia rent relief program are expected to continue through 2022 

revenues from subscriptions and maintenance which we consider recurring in nature comprised 791 of our total consolidated revenue for the twelve months ended december 31 2021 and include transactionbased revenue streams such as transaction and payment processing efiling and digital government services as of december 31 2021 we had 4078 million in cash and investments and available borrowing capacity of 5000 million under our 2021 credit agreement we had outstanding an aggregate principal amount of 600 million of our convertible senior notes and 755 million outstanding under our 2021 credit agreement as of december 31 2021 during the fourth quarter of 2021 we completed our annual assessment of goodwill which did not result in an impairment charge therefore we have recorded no impairment as of and for the period ended december 31 2021 we identified no indicators of impairment to longlived and other assets and therefore no impairment was recorded as of and for the period ended december 31 2021 however due to significant uncertainty surrounding covid19 and market conditions there are no assurances conditions will not deteriorate in the future 

recent adoption of new accounting pronouncements 

in august 2020 the fasb issued accounting standards update “asu” 202006  debt with conversion and other options subtopic 47020 and derivatives and hedging — contracts in entity’s own equity subtopic 81540 accounting for convertible instruments and contracts in an entity’s own equity “asu 202006” which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing the separation models for 1 convertible debt with a cash conversion feature and 2 convertible instruments with a beneficial conversion feature as a result a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost these changes will reduce reported interest expense and increase reported net income for entities that have issued a convertible instrument that was bifurcated according to previously existing rules asu 202006 also requires the application of the ifconverted method for calculating diluted earnings per share and the treasury stock method will be no longer available this standard will be effective for the company’s fiscal years beginning in the first quarter of 2022 with early adoption permitted the company has elected to early adopt this standard as of january 1 2021 our accounting and disclosures related to our convertible senior notes issued on march 9 2021 reflect the requirements of this standard for further information please refer to note 6 “debt” 

in december 2019 the fasb issued asu 201912 simplifying the accounting for income taxes  “asu 201912” which simplifies the accounting for income taxes eliminates certain exceptions within asc 740 income taxes  and clarifies certain aspects of the current guidance to promote consistency among reporting entities the new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2020 we adopted asu 201912 as of january 1 2021 the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

recent accounting guidance not yet adopted 

in october 2021 the fasb issued asu 202108  accounting for contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers asc 805“asu 202108” asu 202108 requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities deferred revenue from acquired contracts using the revenue recognition guidance in topic 606 under this topic 606 approach the acquirer applies the revenue model as if it had originated the contracts this is a departure from the current requirement to measure contract assets and contract liabilities at fair value asu 202108 is effective for all public business entities in annual and interim periods starting after december 15 2022 and early adoption is permitted we early adopted as of january 1 2022 adopting this standard could have a material impact on revenue associated with an acquired business 

outlook 

the local government software market continues to be active with sales activity trending at or near prepandemic levels in most sectors of our business and our backlog at december 31 2021 reached 180 billion a 126 increase from the prior year we expect to continue to achieve solid growth in revenue and earnings with our strong financial position and cash flow we plan to continue to make significant investments in product development and accelerating our move to the cloud to better position us to continue to expand our addressable market and strengthen our competitive position over the long term the expenses associated with the cloud transition are expected to pressure operating margins in 2022 and 2023 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements the reported amounts of revenues cost of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosure of contingencies the notes to the financial statements included as part of this annual report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the application of the progress toward completion methods of revenue recognition estimated standalone selling price ssp for distinct performance obligations the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of intangible assets determination of sharebased compensation expense and valuation allowance for receivables we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition we earn revenue from software licenses royalties subscriptionbased services software services postcontract customer support “pcs” or “maintenance” hardware and appraisal services revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services we determine revenue recognition through the following steps 

• identification of the contract or contracts with a customer 

• identification of the performance obligations in the contract 

• determination of the transaction price 

• allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract 

• recognition of revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation 

most of our software arrangements with customers contain multiple performance obligations that range from software licenses installation training and consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs services hosting and pcs for these contracts we account for individual performance obligations separately when they are distinct we evaluate whether separate performance obligations can be distinct or should be accounted for as one performance obligation arrangements that include software services such as training or installation are evaluated to determine whether the customer can benefit from the services either on their own or together with other resources readily available to the customer and whether the services are separately identifiable from other promises in the contract many of our software arrangements involve “offtheshelf” software we recognize the revenue allocable to offtheshelf software licenses and specified upgrades at a point in time when control of the software license transfers to the customer unless the software is not considered distinct we consider offtheshelf software to be distinct when it can be added to an arrangement with minor changes in the underlying code it can be used by the customer for the customer’s purpose upon installation and remaining services such as training are not considered highly interdependent or highly interrelated to the products functionality 

for arrangements that involve significant production modification or customization of the software or where software services are otherwise not considered distinct we recognize revenue over time by measuring progresstocompletion we measure progresstocompletion primarily using labor hours incurred as it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts these arrangements are often implemented over an extended period and occasionally require us to revise total cost estimates amounts recognized in revenue are calculated using the progresstocompletion measurement after giving effect to any changes in our cost estimates changes to total estimated contract costs if any are recorded in the period they are determined estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which we first determine that a loss is apparent when software services are distinct the fee allocable to the service element is recognized over the time we perform the services and is billed on a time and material or milestones basis 

subscriptionbased services consist of revenues derived from saas arrangements which primarily utilize the tyler private cloud transaction and payment processing electronic filing transactions and digital government services revenue from subscriptionbased services is generally recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer for saas arrangements we evaluate whether the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and whether the customer can feasibly maintain the software on the customer’s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a thirdparty to host the software we allocate contract value to each performance obligation of the arrangement that qualifies for treatment as a distinct element based on estimated ssp we recognize saas arrangements ratably over the terms of the arrangements which range from one to ten years but are typically for periods of three to five years for software services associated with certain saas arrangements we have concluded that the services are not distinct and we recognize the revenue ratably over the remaining contractual period once we have provided the customer access to the software we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 

for transaction and payments revenue and efiling transaction fees we have the right to charge the customer an amount that directly corresponds with the value to the customer of our performance to date therefore we recognize revenue for these services over time based on the amount billable to the customer in accordance with the as invoiced practical expedient in asc 606105518 in some cases we are paid on a fixed fee basis and recognize the revenue ratably over the contractual period typically the structure of our arrangements does not give rise to variable consideration however in those instances whereby variable consideration exists we include in our estimates additional revenue for variable consideration when we believe we have an enforceable right the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable 

the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative ssp basis we determine the ssp based on our overall pricing objectives taking into consideration market conditions and other factors including the value of our contracts the applications sold customer demographics and the number and types of users within our contracts we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services in instances where ssp is not directly observable such as when we do not sell the product or service separately we determine ssp using the expected costplus margin approach revenue is recognized net of allowances for sales adjustments and any taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities 

we maintain allowances for losses and sales adjustments which losses are recorded against revenue at the time the loss is incurred since most of our clients are domestic governmental entities we rarely incur a credit loss resulting from the inability of a client to make required payments events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount for the allowances for losses and sales adjustments may require revision include but are not limited to managing our client’s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products our allowance for losses and sales adjustments of 121 million and 93 million at december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 respectively does not include provisions for credit losses as of january 1 2020 we adopted asu 201613 financial instruments  credit losses  and primarily evaluated our historical experience with credit losses related to trade and other receivables because we rarely experience credit losses with our clients we have not recorded a material reserve for credit losses 

in connection with certain of our contracts we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet date many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period we review unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue in addition we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue which represents billings in excess of revenue earned the majority of this liability consists of subscriptions and maintenance billings for which payments are made in advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the subscription or maintenance period generally one year we also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit and the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product have not been met on a periodic basis we review by customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains appropriate 

business combinations accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values the determination of fair value requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions and in making these determinations management uses all available information 

for tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination management estimates the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on quoted market prices the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses the assumptions made in performing these valuations include but are not limited to discount rates future revenues and operating costs projections of capital costs and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants 

due to the specialized nature of these calculations we engage thirdparty specialists to assist management in evaluating our assumptions as well as appropriately measuring the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed we adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation as necessary up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain new information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the closing date if actual results are materially different than the assumptions we used to determine fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed through a business combination as well as the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangible assets it is possible that adjustments to the carrying values of such assets and liabilities will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

intangible assets and goodwill  our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge the cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value with the excess allocated to goodwill accordingly we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets including software customer related intangibles trade name leases and goodwill these intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives we currently have no intangible assets with indefinite lives other than goodwill 

we assess goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable we begin with the qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying value before applying the quantitative assessment described below when testing goodwill for impairment quantitatively we first compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized the fair values calculated in our impairment tests are determined using discounted cash flow models involving several assumptions level 3 inputs the assumptions that are used are based upon what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain we evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by comparing the total of the fair value of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization 

we have historically performed our annual assessment of goodwill impairment as of april 1 during the second quarter of 2021 we voluntarily changed the date of our annual assessment of goodwill to october 1 for all reporting units the change in testing date for goodwill impairment is a change in accounting principle which management believes is preferable as the new date of the assessment better aligns with our annual planning process the change in the assessment date did not delay or avoid a potential impairment charge nor did it change our requirement to assess goodwill on an interim date between scheduled annual testing dates if triggering events are present to ensure that no lapse in an assessment occurred since the prior period we performed qualitative assessments as of april 1 for all reporting units except for the data and insights and platform technologies reporting units as a result of these qualitative assessments we determined that it was not more likely than not that an impairment existed therefore we did not perform step 1 quantitative impairment test we did perform a quantitative assessment for goodwill associated with our data and insights and platform technologies reporting units as of april 1 2021 as a result of our interim qualitative and quantitative assessments we concluded no impairment existed 

during the fourth quarter as part of our annual impairment test as of october 1 we performed qualitative assessments for all reporting units except for recently acquired businesses as a result of these qualitative assessments we determined that it was not more likely than not that an impairment existed therefore we did not perform a step 1 quantitative impairment test we did perform a quantitative assessment for goodwill associated with our recently acquired businesses data and insights nic and platform technologies reporting units and concluded no impairment existed as of our annual assessment date the data and insights nic and platform technologies business units combined goodwill was 16 billion or 68 of total goodwill as of december 31 2021 our annual goodwill impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge during 2021 we have recorded no impairment to goodwill as no triggering events or changes in circumstances indicating a potential impairment have occurred as of periodend 

determining the fair value of our reporting units involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty changes in market conditions or other factors outside of our control such as the covid19 pandemic could cause us to change key assumptions and our judgment about a reporting unit’s prospects similarly in a specific period a reporting unit could significantly underperform relative to its historical or projected future operating results either situation could result in a meaningfully different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units and a consequent future impairment charge 

all intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of other intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows the assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved such indicators may include among others a significant decline in expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition and reductions in growth rates in addition products capabilities or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or noncompetitive any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets during 2021 we did not identify any triggering events that would indicate that the carrying amount of our intangible assets may not be recoverable 

sharebased compensation we have a stock incentive plan that provides for the grant of stock options restricted stock units and performance stock units to key employees directors and nonemployee consultants we estimate the fair value of sharebased awards on the date of grant sharebased compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures which will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from such estimates changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data 

we estimate stock price volatility at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock estimated option life is determined using the weightedaverage period the stock options are expected to be outstanding based primarily on the options’ vesting terms remaining contractual life and the employees’ expected exercise based on historical patterns determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates 

analysis of results of operations and other 

the following discussion compares the historical results of operations on a basis consistent with gaap for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 



2021 compared to 2020 

revenues 

acquisitions 

on april 21 2021 we acquired nic and as result of the merger nic became a direct subsidiary of the company and nic’s subsidiaries became indirect subsidiaries nic is a leading digital government solutions and payment company that serves federal state and local government agencies 

the following table details revenue in thousands for nic for the period from acquisition through december 31 2021 which is included in our consolidated statements of income from the date of acquisition the results of nic are included with the operating results of the nic segment from the date of acquisition 



software licenses and royalties 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software licenses and royalties revenue for the years ended december 31 



software licenses and royalties revenue increased 2 compared to the prior year the growth is primarily attributed to several large onpremise sales of our courts and justice enterprise and platform technologies solutions partially offset by the shift in the mix of new software contracts toward more subscriptionbased agreements compared to the prior year our mix of new software contracts in 2021 was approximately 33 perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 67 subscriptionbased arrangements compared to total new client mix in 2020 of approximately 38 perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 62 subscriptionbased arrangements 

although the mix of new contracts between subscriptionbased and perpetual license arrangements may vary from quarter to quarter and year to year we expect our longerterm software license growth rate to be negatively impacted by a growing number of customers choosing our subscriptionbased options rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement subscriptionbased arrangements result in lower software license revenue in the initial year as compared to perpetual software license arrangements but generate higher overall revenue over the term of the contract 

subscriptions 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our subscriptions revenue for the years ended december 31 



subscriptionbased revenue primarily consists of revenue derived from our saas arrangements as part of our subscriptionbased services we also provide electronic document filing solutions “efiling” that simplify the filing and management of court related documents for courts and law offices efiling revenue is derived from transaction fees and fixed fee arrangements other sources of subscriptionbased services are derived from transactionbased fees primarily related to digital government services and payment processing 

subscriptionbased revenue increased 124 compared to 2020 primarily due to the inclusion of nic’s revenues from the date of acquisition excluding the impact of revenue from 2021 acquisitions of 3517 million subscriptions revenue increased 234 new saas clients as well as existing clients who converted to our saas model provided the majority of the subscription revenue increase in 2021 we added 533 new saas clients and 239 existing clients elected to convert to our saas model also transactionbased fees contributed 191 million to the increase in subscription revenue due to the increased volumes of online payments and slightly increased efiling services volumes in 2021 

software services 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software services revenue for the years ended december 31 



software services revenue primarily consists of professional services billed in connection with implementing our software converting client data training client personnel custom development activities and consulting new clients who purchase our proprietary software licenses or subscriptions generally also contract with us to provide for the related software services existing clients also periodically purchase additional training consulting and minor programming services 

software services revenue increased 12 compared to the prior year period primarily due to the inclusion of nic’s revenues from the date of acquisition excluding the impact of revenue from 2021 acquisitions of 238 million software services revenue declined 05 the decline in software services revenue is primarily attributed to a decline in billable travel revenue as most services are now being delivered virtually rather than onsite also contributing to the decline is the increase of clients selecting our cloud solutions instead of our onpremises license arrangements which typically require more professional services 

maintenance 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our maintenance revenue for the years ended december 31 



we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and certain thirdparty software maintenance revenue was essentially flat and grew 1 compared to the prior year maintenance revenue increased mainly due to contributions of maintenance revenue from recent acquisitions and completing the recognition of the majority of acquisitionrelated deferred maintenance revenue that was fair valued at rates below tylers average maintenance rate in prior periods the remainder of the increase is attributed to annual maintenance rate increases and growth in our installed customer base from new software license sales offset by attrition the impact of customers selecting our saas solutions instead of onpremises solutions and clients converting from onpremises license arrangements to subscriptions 

appraisal services 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our appraisal services revenue for the years ended december 31 



in 2021 appraisal services revenue increased 32 compared to the prior year primarily due to relaxed travel restrictions allowing for the rampup of appraisal services for several new revaluation contracts which started in recent quarters the appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states 

cost of revenues and gross margins 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues for the years ended december 31 



the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the years ended december 31 



software licenses royalties and acquired software  cost of software licenses royalties and acquired software is primarily comprised of amortization expense for acquired software and thirdparty software costs we do not have any direct costs associated with royalties the gross margin decrease of 209 is due to the increased amortization expense related to acquired software from acquisitions completed in 2021 

subscriptions software services and maintenance  cost of subscriptions software services and maintenance primarily consists of personnel costs related to installation of our software conversion of client data training client personnel and support activities and various other services such as custom client development ongoing operation of saas digital government and other transactionbased services such as efiling other costs included are interchange fees required to process creditdebit card transactions and bank fees to process automated clearinghouse transactions related to our payments business in 2021 the subscriptions software services and maintenance gross margin declined 36 compared to the prior year primarily due to the inclusion of nic’s revenues which historically have lower margins than tyler excluding the impact from 2021 acquisitions gross margin was 490 in 2021 a decrease of 02 primarily due to higher employee headcount our implementation and support staff grew by 125 employees since december 31 2020 as we increased hiring to ensure that we are wellpositioned to deliver our current backlog and anticipated new business the decline in margin is partially offset by improved utilization of our professional services staff resulting from the shift to virtual delivery of most implementation services 

appraisal services  appraisal services revenue comprised approximately 17 of total revenue the appraisal services gross margin increase of 69 compared to 2020 is primarily due to ramping of several new revaluation projects and cost savings attributed to lower travel expenses associated with appraisal projects the appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states 

gross margin  our 2021 blended gross margin decreased 40 compared to 2020 primarily due to the inclusion of nic’s revenues which historically have lower margins than tyler excluding the impact from 2021 acquisitions overall gross margin was 485 in the current year period the slight decrease of 01 in overall gross margin is attributed to increased amortization expense related to acquired software from recent acquisitions partially offset by a reduction in software services revenue from reimbursable travel that has little to no margin as well as improved utilization of our professional services staff resulting from the shift to virtual delivery of most implementation services 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses consist primarily of salaries employee benefits travel sharebased compensation expense commissions and related overhead costs for administrative and sales and marketing employees as well as professional fees trade show activities advertising costs and other marketing costs the following table sets forth a comparison of our sga expenses for the years ended december 31 



sga as a percentage of revenue was 245 in 2021 compared to 232 in 2020 sga expense increased approximately 50 compared to the prior year period primarily due to the inclusion nic’s sga expenses excluding the impact of sga expense from 2021 acquisitions of 491 million sga increased 316 compared to prior year periods the increase in sga is attributed to transaction costs related to recent acquisitions higher stock compensation expense higher bonus and commission expense due to improved operating results and other administrative expenses compared to prior periods in 2021 sga includes 235 million of transaction expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2021 we also incurred 16 million of expense related to a separation agreement with nics former chief executive officer during 2021 stock compensation expense rose 318 million compared to prior periods primarily due to an increase in sharebased awards issued in connection with our stock compensation plan coupled with the higher fair value of each sharebased award due to the increase in our stock price sga expense also included 32 million related to an accrual for litigation 

research and development expense 

research and development expense consists primarily of salaries employee benefits and related overhead costs associated with new product development the following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the years ended december 31 



research and development expense consists mainly of costs associated with development of new products and technologies from which we do not currently generate significant revenue 

research and development expense increased 6 in 2021 compared to the prior year period mainly due to a number of new tyler product development initiatives across our product suites including increased investments in research and development at recently acquired businesses to support these initiatives our research and development staff grew by 107 since december 31 2020 

amortization of customer and trade name intangibles 

acquisition intangibles are comprised of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that is allocated to acquired software leases and customer and trade name intangibles the remaining excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues while amortization expense of customer and trade name intangibles is recorded as operating expense the estimated useful lives of both customer and trade name intangibles range from five to 25 years the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the years ended december 31 



amortization of customer and trade name intangibles increased due to the impact of intangibles added with several acquisitions completed in 2021 

estimated annual amortization expense relating to customer trade name and lease acquisition intangibles excluding acquired software for which the amortization expense is recorded as cost of revenues for the next five years and thereafter is as follows in thousands 



interest expense 

the following table sets forth a comparison of interest expense for the years ended december 31 



interest expense is primarily comprised of interest expense and commitment and other fees associated with our borrowings  the change in interest expense compared to the prior period is attributable to higher levels of borrowings related to the 2021 credit agreement and convertible senior notes including 64 million related to the senior unsecured bridge loan facility commitment fee in 2021 

other income net 

the following table sets forth a comparison of other income net for the years ended december 31 



other income is comprised of interest income from invested cash the decrease in other income net compared to the prior period is attributable to the significant decrease in interest rates on invested cash balances since march 2020 partially offset by higher levels of invested cash 

income tax provision 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the years ended december 31 



the increase in the income tax provision and the effective income tax rate in 2021 compared to the prior year is primarily due to a decrease in excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation in 2021 the sharebased exercise and vesting activity in 2021 generated 477 million of excess tax benefits while exercise and vesting activity in 2020 generated 602 million of excess tax benefits excluding the impact of the excess tax benefits our income tax provision and effective tax rate in 2021 would have been 452 million and 284 and in 2020 would have been 404 million and 231 respectively 

the effective income tax rates in both 2021 and 2020 differed from the united states federal statutory corporate income tax rate of 21 primarily due to excess tax benefits related to stock incentive awards the tax benefit of research tax credits and the 

release of reserves for unrecognized income tax benefits resulting from expiration of the statutes of limitations for certain tax years offset by state income taxes and nondeductible business expenses 

financial condition and liquidity 

as of december 31 2021 we had cash and cash equivalents of 3092 million compared to 6036 million at december 31 2020 we also had 987 million invested in investment grade corporate bonds municipal bonds and assetbacked securities as of december 31 2021 compared to 1548 million at december 31 2020 these investments mature from 2022 through 2027 during the fourth quarter management determined that our investment portfolio would no longer be held to maturity the impact to the financial statements in the current year is not material cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with several domestic banks and money market funds as of december 31 2021 we had 7485 million outstanding borrowings under our 2021 credit agreement and one outstanding letter of credit totaling 20 million in favor of a client contract we believe our cash on hand cash from operating activities availability under our revolving line of credit and access to the credit markets provide us with sufficient flexibility to meet our longterm financial needs 

the following table sets forth a summary of cash flows for the years ended december 31 



net cash provided by operating activities continues to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures other potential capital resources include cash on hand public and private issuances of debt or equity securities and bank borrowings it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets in the future may be limited by economic conditions or other factors we currently believe that our cash on hand cash provided by operating activities and available credit are sufficient to 

fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures income tax obligations and share repurchases for at least the next twelve months 

in 2021 operating activities provided cash of 3718 million compared to 3551 million in 2020 operating activities that provided cash were primarily comprised of net income of 1615 million noncash depreciation and amortization charges of 1356 million noncash sharebased compensation expense of 1047 million and noncash decrease in operating lease rightofuse assets of 102 million working capital excluding cash decreased approximately 431 million due to mainly due to timing of payments to and receipts from our government partners and enduser consumers timing of prepaid expenses timing of payments of payroll related taxes and vendor invoices and deferred taxes associated with stock option activity during the period these increases were offset by the timing of tax payments and an increase in deferred revenue during the period in general changes in deferred revenue are cyclical and primarily driven by the timing of our maintenance renewal billings our renewal dates occur throughout the year but our largest renewal billing cycles occur in the second and fourth quarters in addition subscription renewals are billed throughout the year 

days sales outstanding in accounts receivable were 108 days at december 31 2021 compared to 121 days at december 31 2020 dso is calculated based on quarterend accounts receivable divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by 360 days the decrease in dso compared to december 31 2020 is attributed to improved collection efforts and a reduction in unbilled receivables related to contracts under which revenue is being recognized on the percentage of completion basis 

investing activities used cash of 21 billion in 2021 compared to 983 million in 2020 we invested 775 million and received 1314 million in proceeds from investment grade corporate bonds municipal bonds and assetbacked securities with maturity dates ranging from 2022 through 2027 on march 31 2021 we completed two acquisitions with the total purchase price net of cash acquired of 121 million paid in cash on april 21 2021 we completed the acquisition of nic for the total purchase price of 20 billion net of cash acquired of 3318 million including cash paid of 23 billion and 19 million of purchase consideration related to the conversion of unvested restricted stock awards on september 1 2021 we acquired vendengine for the total purchase price net of cash acquired of 17 million of approximately 838 million consisting of 802 million paid in cash and approximately 54 million related to indemnity holdbacks subject to certain postclosing adjustments on september 9 2021 we acquired all of the equity interest of arx for the total purchase price net of cash acquired of approximately 128 million of which 123 million was paid in cash and approximately 05 million was accrued for indemnity holdbacks approximately 339 million was invested in property and equipment including 128 million related to real estate in addition approximately 217 million of software development was capitalized in 2021 the remaining additions were for computer equipment and furniture and fixtures in support of internal growth with the majority associated with our data centers supporting growth in our cloudbased offerings these expenditures were funded from cash generated from operations

from time to time we engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates in order to pursue such opportunities which could require significant commitments of capital we may be required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive securities in the future no assurance can be given as to our future acquisition opportunities and how such opportunities will be financed we lease office facilities for use in our operations as well as transportation and other equipment most of our leases are noncancelable operating lease agreements and they expire from one year to 10 years some of these leases include options to extend for up to 10 years 

capitalization

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial market prices and interest rates 

as of december 31 2021 we had 7550 million in outstanding principal under our 2021 credit agreement and available borrowing capacity under the 2021 credit agreement was 5000 million 

borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loan a1 will bear interest at the company’s option at a per annum rate of either 1 the administrative agent’s prime commercial lending rate subject to certain higher rate determinations the “base rate” plus a margin of 0125 to 075 or 2 the one three six or subject to approval by all lenders twelvemonth libor rate plus a margin of 1125 to 175 the term loan a2 will bear interest at the company’s option at a per annum rate of either 1 the base rate plus a margin of 0 to 05 or 2 the one three or six or subject to approval by all lenders twelvemonth libor rate plus a margin of 0875 to 15 

during the year ended december 31 2021 our effective average interest rate for our borrowings was 184 as of december 31 2021 our interest rate was 155 for our outstanding borrowings based on the debt under the 2021 credit agreement the aggregate outstanding principal as of december 31 2021 is 7550 million and each quarter point change in interest rates would result in a 19 million change in annual interest expense

traditionally local government bodies and agencies performed statemandated duties including property assessment record keeping road maintenance law enforcement administration of election and judicial functions and the provision of welfare assistance today a host of emerging and urgent issues are confronting local governments each of which demands a service response these areas include criminal justice and corrections administration and finance public safety health and human services planning regulatory and maintenance and records and document management transfers of responsibility from the federal and state governments to county and municipal governments and agencies in these and other areas also place additional service and financial requirements on these local government units in addition constituents of local governments are increasingly demanding improved service and better access to information from public entities as a result local governments recognize the increasing value of information management systems and services to among other things improve revenue collection provide increased access to information and streamline delivery of services to their constituents local government bodies are now recognizing that “egovernment” is an additional responsibility for community development from integrated tax systems to integrated civil and criminal justice information systems many counties and cities have benefited significantly from the implementation of jurisdictionwide systems that allow different agencies or government offices to share data and provide a more comprehensive approach to information management many city and county governmental agencies also have unique individual information management requirements which must be tailored to the specific functions of each particular office 

many local governments also have difficulties attracting and retaining the staff necessary to support their it functions as a result they seek to establish longterm relationships with reliable providers of high quality it products and services such as tyler 

although local governments often face budgetary constraints in their operations their primary revenue sources are usually property taxes and to a lesser extent utility billings and other fees which historically tend to be relatively stable in addition the acquisition of new technology typically enables local governments to operate more efficiently and often provides a measurable return on investment that justifies the purchase of software and related services 

gartner inc a leading information technology research and advisory company estimates that state and local government application and vertical specific software spending will grow from 195 billion in 2021 to 251 billion in 2024 the professional services and support segments of the market are expected to expand from 290 billion in 2021 to 335 billion in 2024 application and vertical specific software sales in the primary and secondary education segments of the market is expected to expand from 30 billion in 2021 to 43 billion in 2024 while professional services and support are expected to grow from 30 billion in 2021 to 37 billion in 2024

appraisal services 

we are the nation’s largest provider of property appraisal outsourcing services for local government taxing authorities these services include 

• the physical inspection of commercial and residential properties 

• data collection and processing 

• sophisticated computer analyses for property valuation

• community education regarding the assessment process 

• arbitration between taxpayers and the assessing jurisdiction 

local government taxing authorities normally reappraise properties from time to time to update values for tax assessment purposes and to maintain equity in the taxing process in some jurisdictions law mandates reassessment cycles in others they are discretionary while some taxing jurisdictions perform reappraisals inhouse many local governments outsource this function because of its cyclical nature and because of the specialized knowledge and expertise requirements associated with it our appraisal services business unit has operated in this business since 1938 

in some instances we also provide property tax andor appraisal software products in connection with appraisal outsourcing projects while other clients may only engage us to provide appraisal services appraisal outsourcing services are somewhat seasonal in nature to the extent that winter weather conditions reduce the productivity of data collection activities in connection with those projects 

strategy 

our objective is to grow our revenue and earnings organically supplemented by focused strategic acquisitions the key components of our business strategy are to 

• provide high quality value–added products and services to our clients  we compete on the basis of among other things delivering to clients our deep domain expertise in local government operations through the highest value products and services in the market we believe we have achieved a reputation as a premium product and service provider to the local government market 

• continue to expand our product and service offerings  while we already have what we believe to be the broadest line of software products for local governments we continually upgrade our core software applications and expand our complementary product and service offerings to respond to technological advancements and the changing needs of our clients in 2010 we began providing efiling for courts and law offices which simplifies the filing and management of court related documents we believe revenue from efiling solutions will continue to grow over time as more local and state governments mandate electronic document filings we also offer solutions that allow the public to access data and conduct transactions with local governments such as paying traffic tickets property taxes and utility bills online we believe that the addition of such features enhances the market appeal of our core products we have also broadened our offerings of consulting and business process reengineering services 

• expand our client base  we seek to establish longterm relationships with new clients primarily through our sales and marketing efforts while we currently have clients in all 50 states canada the caribbean the united kingdom australia and other international locations not all of our solutions have achieved nationwide geographic penetration we intend to continue to expand into new geographic markets by adding sales staff and targeting marketing efforts by solutions in those areas we also intend to continue to expand our customer base to include more large governments while our traditional market focus has primarily been on small and midsized governments our increased size and market presence together with the technological advances and improved scalability of certain of our solutions are allowing us to achieve increasing success in selling to larger clients we also expect to expand our presence in international markets by leveraging our leadership position in the united states through the disciplined pursuit of selected opportunities in other countries 

• expand our existing client relationships  our existing customer base offers significant opportunities for additional sales of solutions and services that we currently offer but that existing clients do not fully utilize addon sales to existing clients typically involve lower sales and marketing expenses than sales to new clients 

• grow recurring revenues  we have a large recurring revenue base from maintenance and support and subscriptionbased services which generated revenues of 8182 million or 73 of total revenues in 2020 we have historically experienced very low customer turnover approximately 2 annually and recurring revenues continue to grow as the installed customer base increases subscriptionbased revenues have been our fastest growing revenue category over the past five years increasing from 1427 million in 2016 to 3506 million in 2020 

• maximize economies of scale and take advantage of financial leverage in our business  we seek to build and maintain a larger client base to create economies of scale enabling us to provide valueadded products and services to our clients while expanding our operating margins because we sell primarily “offtheshelf” software increased sales of the same solutions result in incrementally higher gross margins in addition we believe that we have a marketing and administrative infrastructure in place that can be leveraged to accommodate significant longterm growth without proportionately increasing selling general and administrative expenses 

• attract and retain highly qualified employees  we believe that the depth and quality of our management and staff is one of our significant strengths and that the ability to retain such employees is crucial to our continued growth and success we believe that our stable management team financial strength and growth opportunities as well as our leadership position in the local government market enhance our attractiveness as an employer for highly skilled employees 

• pursue selected strategic acquisitions  while we expect to primarily grow internally from time to time we selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that provide us with one or more of the following 

• new products and services to complement our existing offerings 

• entry into new markets related to the public sector 

• new clients andor geographic expansion 

• establish strategic alliances  in october 2019 we announced a strategic collaboration agreement with amazon web services aws for cloud hosting services this agreement brings together tyler the nations largest software company exclusively focused on the public sector and aws the broadest and deepest cloud platform specifically the agreement with aws provides the framework for development training and collaboration in order to support nextgeneration applications that have the scalability resiliency and security aws offers it will assist tyler in accelerating innovation and the development of strategic initiatives these initiatives will bring the most advanced cloudnative services to tyler clients improving the flow of information and providing a better experience for state local and federal governments 

sales marketing and clients 

we market our products and services through direct sales and marketing personnel located throughout the united states other inhouse sales staff focus on addon sales professional services and support 

sales of new systems are typically generated from referrals from other government offices or departments within a county or municipality referrals from other local governments relationships established between sales representatives and county or local officials contacts at trade shows direct mailings and direct contact from prospects already familiar with us we are active in numerous national state county and local government associations and participate in annual meetings trade shows and educational events 

clients consist primarily of federal state county and municipal agencies school districts and other local government offices in counties clients include the auditor treasurer tax assessorcollector county clerk district clerk county and district court judges probation officers sheriff and county appraiser at municipal government sites clients include directors from various departments including administration finance utilities public works code enforcement personnel purchasing taxation municipal court and police contracts for software products and services are generally implemented over periods of three months to one year although some complex implementations may span multiple years with annually renewing maintenance and support update agreements thereafter although either the client or we can terminate these agreements historically almost all support and maintenance agreements are automatically renewed annually during 2020 approximately 42 of our revenue was attributable to ongoing support and maintenance agreements 

competition 

we compete with numerous local regional and national firms that provide or offer some or many of the same solutions and services that we provide many of these competitors are smaller companies that may be able to offer less expensive solutions than ours many of these firms operate within a specific geographic area andor in a narrow product or service niche we also compete with national firms some of which have greater financial and technical resources than we do including oracle corporation infor sap ag workday inc centralsquare technologies thomson reuters corporation motorola solutions inc axon enterprise inc and constellation software inc in addition we sometimes compete with consulting and systems integration firms which develop custom systems primarily for larger governments we also occasionally compete with central internal information service departments of local governments which requires us to persuade the enduser department to discontinue service by its own personnel and outsource the service to us 

we compete on a variety of factors including price service name recognition reputation technological capabilities and the ability to modify existing products and services to accommodate the individual requirements of the client our ability to offer an integrated system of applications for several offices or departments is often a competitive advantage governmental units often are required to seek competitive proposals through a request for proposal process and some prospective clients use consultants to assist them with the proposal and vendor selection process 

suppliers 

substantially all of the computers peripherals printers scanners operating system software office automation software and other equipment necessary for the implementation and provision of our software systems and services are presently available from several thirdparty sources hardware is purchased on original equipment manufacturer or distributor terms at discounts from retail we have not experienced any significant supply problems 

backlog 

at december 31 2020 our revenue backlog was approximately 159 billion compared to 146 billion at december 31 2019 the backlog generally represents signed contracts under which the revenue has not been recognized as of yearend approximately 7800 million or 49 of the backlog is expected to be recognized during 2021 

intellectual property proprietary rights and licenses 

we regard certain features of our internal operations software and documentation as confidential and proprietary and rely on a combination of contractual restrictions trade secret laws and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property we generally do not rely on patents we believe that due to the rapid rate of technological change in the computer software industry trade secrets and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as knowledge ability and experience of our employees frequent product enhancements and timeliness and quality of support services we typically license our software products under nonexclusive license agreements which are generally nontransferable and have a perpetual term

risks associated with our software products 

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities can disrupt our business and harm our competitive position 

threats to it security can take a variety of forms individuals and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations including statesponsored organizations may take steps that pose threats to our clients and our it they may for example develop and deploy malicious software to attack our products and services andor gain access to our networks and data centers or act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks cyber threats are constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and clients breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications impair our ability to provide services to our clients and protect the privacy of their data result in product development delays compromise confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or otherwise adversely affect our business our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these evolving threats despite the network and application security internal control measures and physical security procedures we employ to safeguard our systems we may still be vulnerable to a security breach intrusion loss or theft of confidential client data and transaction data or proprietary company information which may harm our business reputation and future financial results the lost revenue and containment remediation investigation legal and other costs could be significant and may exceed our insurance policy limits or may not be covered by insurance at all further we may be subject to regulatory enforcement actions and litigation that could result in financial judgments or the payment of settlement amounts and disputes with insurance carriers concerning coverage 

on september 29 2020 we filed a current report on form 8k reporting a security incident the incident involving ransomware disrupting access to some of our internal it systems and telephone systems there is no evidence that the environments where we host client applications were affected and our hosting services to those clients were not interrupted there is also no evidence of malicious activity on client networks associated with the incident we contained the incident and recovered from it resuming normal operations with our clients we will continue to deploy supplemental remediation efforts as necessary 

as part of our immediate response to the incident we 1 shut down points of access to external systems and began investigating and remediating the problem 2 engaged outside it security and forensics experts to conduct a detailed review and help securely restore affected systems 3 implemented targeted monitoring systems to supplement the systems we already had in place and 4 notified law enforcement we have cooperated with their investigation throughout 

we promptly notified our clients of the incident and provided timely updates to our clients through direct communications and updates to our website 

although we believe we have contained and recovered from the incident and that we have taken and will continue to take appropriate remediation steps we are subject to risk and uncertainties as a result of the incident we believe we are in the final phases of our investigation but there can be no assurance as to what the ongoing impact of the incident will be if any the incident caused an interruption in parts of our business we incurred 42 million in third party costs associated with the incident as of december 31 2020 it is expected that we will continue to incur costs related to our response remediation and investigatory efforts relating to the incident we maintain cybersecurity insurance coverage in an amount that we believe is adequate 

disclosure of personally identifiable information andor other sensitive client data could result in liability and harm our reputation 

we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information and other confidential information of our clients the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security despite our efforts to improve security controls it is possible our security controls over personal data our training of employees on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of sensitive client data that we store and manage disclosure of personally identifiable information andor other sensitive client data could result in liability and harm our reputation 

hosting services for some of our products are dependent upon the uninterrupted operation of data centers 

a material portion of our business is provided through software hosting services these hosting services depend on the uninterrupted operation of data centers and the ability to protect computer equipment and information stored in these data centers against damage that may be caused by natural disaster fire power loss telecommunications or internet failure acts of terrorism unauthorized intrusion computer viruses and other similar damaging events if any of our data centers were to become inoperable for an extended period we might be unable to fulfill our contractual commitments although we take what we believe to be reasonable precautions against such occurrences we can give no assurance that damaging events such as these will not result in a prolonged interruption of our services which could result in client dissatisfaction loss of revenue and damage to our business 

we run the risk of errors or defects with new products or enhancements to existing products 

our software products are complex and may contain errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released any such defects could result in a loss of revenues or delay market acceptance our license agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability however it is possible we may not always successfully negotiate such provisions in our client contracts or the limitation of liability provisions may not be effective due to existing or future federal state or local laws ordinances or judicial decisions although we maintain errors and omissions and general liability insurance and we try to structure contracts to limit liability we cannot assure you that a successful claim could not be made or would not have a material adverse effect on our future operating results 

we must timely respond to technological changes to be competitive 

the market for our products is characterized by technological change evolving industry standards in software technology changes in client requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments satisfy increasingly sophisticated client requirements and achieve market acceptance we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and costeffective manner the products capabilities or technologies developed by others could also render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to develop or acquire new software products or develop enhancements to existing products on a timely and costeffective basis or if such new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance 

we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights 

many of our product and service offerings incorporate proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of contracts copyrights and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology we cannot be certain that we have taken all appropriate steps to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property there has also been an apparent evolution in the legal standards and regulations courts and the us patent office may apply in favorably evaluating software patent rights we are not currently involved in any material intellectual property litigation however we may be a party to such litigation in the future to protect our proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us with respect to current or future products any claims or litigation with or without merit could be timeconsuming costly and a diversion to management any such claims and litigation could also cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements such royalty or licensing arrangements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all therefore litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business regardless of the final outcome of such litigation 

clients may elect to terminate our maintenance contracts and manage operations internally 

it is possible that our clients may elect to not renew maintenance contracts for our software trying instead to maintain and operate the software themselves using their perpetual license rights excluding software applications that we provide on a hosted or cloud basis alternatively clients may elect to drop maintenance on certain modules that they ultimately decide not to use this could adversely affect our revenues and profits additionally they may inadvertently allow our intellectual property or other information to fall into the hands of third parties including our competitors which could adversely affect our business 

material portions of our business require the internet infrastructure to be reliable 

part of our future success continues to depend on the use of the internet as a means to access public information and perform transactions electronically including for example electronic filing of court documents this in part requires ongoing maintenance of the internet infrastructure especially to prevent interruptions in service as well as additional development of that infrastructure this requires a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed data capacity security and timely development of complementary products for providing reliable internet access and services if this infrastructure fails to be sufficiently developed or be adequately maintained our business would be harmed because users may not be able to access our government portals 

risks associated with selling products and services into the public sector marketplace 

selling products and services into the public sector poses unique challenges 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of software and services to state county and city governments other federal or municipal agencies and other public entities we expect that sales to public sector clients will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues in the future we face many risks and challenges associated with contracting with governmental entities including 

• resource limitations caused by budgetary constraints which may provide for a termination of executed contracts due to a lack of future funding 

• long and complex sales cycles 

• contract payments at times being subject to achieving implementation milestones and we may have differences with clients as to whether milestones have been achieved 

• political resistance to the concept of contracting with third parties to provide it solutions 

• legislative changes affecting a local government’s authority to contract with third parties 

• varying bid procedures and internal processes for bid acceptance 

• various other political factors including changes in governmental administrations and personnel 

each of these risks is outside our control if we fail to adequately adapt to these risks and uncertainties our financial performance could be adversely affected 

covid19 will adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we expect that the continued global spread of covid19 novel coronavirus will negatively impact our business and financial results in fiscal year 2021 as the virus has spread it has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to contain the virus including travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelterinplace orders and business limitations and shutdowns while we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that covid19 will have on our results from operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties including the duration and severity of the pandemic and containment measures and associated compliance we do expect the pandemic will continue to negatively impact our revenues and other financial results 

because an increasing portion of our revenues are recurring the effect of covid19 on our results of operations may also not be fully reflected for some time we continue to see some impact on our business in the near term with delays in government procurement processes and uncertainty around public sector budgets as well as delays in implementations caused by travel restrictions closed offices or clients shifting focus to more pressing issues 

we expect appraisal and software implementations projects to be delayed as clients put projects on hold or slow projects by extending golive dates while we have the ability to deliver most of our professional services remotely some of our professional services including appraisal assessments are more effective when performed onsite and certain clients may continue to insist on onsite services in any event in addition some professional services relate to training and require the availability of the client we expect a negative impact on our software services and appraisal services revenues also we expect software licenses and subscriptions revenues to be negatively affected due to delays in procurement processes some clients could request changes to payment terms negatively impacting the timing of collections of accounts receivables in future periods for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 73 of our total revenue and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription and maintenance revenue which is recurring in nature thus the effect of the covid19 pandemic will not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial performance until future periods 

we perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the second quarter of each year subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results changes in management’s business strategy an inability to successfully introduce new products in the 

marketplace an inability to successfully achieve internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price which may represent an indicator of impairment the occurrence of any of these events which could be caused or impacted by the covid19 pandemic may require us to record future goodwill impairment charges 

a prolonged economic slowdown could harm our operations 

a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce demand for our software products and services governments may face financial pressures that could in turn affect our growth rate and profitability in the future there is no assurance that government spending levels will be unaffected by declining or stagnant general economic conditions and if budget shortfalls occur they may negatively impact government it spending and could adversely affect our business 

the open bidding process creates uncertainty in predicting future contract awards 

many governmental agencies purchase products and services through an open bidding process generally a governmental entity will publish an established list of requirements requesting potential vendors to propose solutions for the established requirements to respond successfully to these requests for proposals we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract the time required to establish operations for the proposed client and the likely terms of any other thirdparty proposals submitted we cannot guarantee that we will win any bids in the future through the request for proposal process or that any winning bids will ultimately result in contracts on favorable terms our failure to secure contracts through the open bidding process or to secure such contracts on favorable terms may adversely affect our revenue and gross margins 

we face significant competition from other vendors and potential new entrants into our markets 

we believe we are a leading provider of integrated solutions for the public sector however we face competition from a variety of software vendors that offer products and services similar to those offered by us as well as from companies offering to develop custom software we compete based on a number of factors including 

• the attractiveness of our “evergreen” business strategy 

• the breadth depth and quality of our product and service offerings 

• the ability to modify our offerings to accommodate particular clients’ needs 

• technological innovation 

• name recognition reputation and references 

• price 

• our financial strength and stability 

we believe our market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors that vary in size product platform and product scope our competitors include consulting firms publicly held companies that focus on selected segments of the public sector market and a significant number of smaller privately held companies certain competitors have greater technical marketing and financial resources than we do we cannot assure you that such competitors will not develop products or offer services that are superior to our products or services or that achieve greater market acceptance 

we also compete with internal centralized it departments of governmental entities which requires us to persuade the enduser to stop the internal service and outsource to us in addition our clients and prospective clients could elect to provide information management services internally through new or existing departments which could reduce the market for our services 

we could face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the public sector software application market and new products and technologies are introduced increased competition could result in pricing pressure fewer client orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective clients it is possible that new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect upon our business 

fixedprice contracts may affect our profits 

some of our contracts are structured on a fixedprice basis which can lead to various risks including 

• the failure to accurately estimate the resources and time required for an engagement 

• the failure to effectively manage our clients’ expectations regarding the scope of services delivered for a fixed fee 

• the failure to timely and satisfactorily complete fixedprice engagements within budget 

if we do not adequately assess and manage these and other risks we may be subject to cost overruns and penalties which may harm our financial performance 

changes in the insurance markets may affect our business 

some of our clients primarily those for our property appraisal services require that we secure performance bonds before they will select us as their vendor in addition we have in the past been required to provide letters of credit as security for the issuance of a performance bond we cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure such performance bonds in the future on terms that are favorable to us if at all our inability to obtain performance bonds on favorable terms or at all could impact our future ability to win some contract awards particularly large property appraisal services contracts which could negatively impact revenues in addition the general insurance markets may experience volatility andor restrictive coverage trends which may lead to future increases in our general and administrative expenses and negatively impact our operating results 

risks associated with our periodic results and stock price 

fluctuations in quarterly revenue could adversely impact our operating results and stock price 

our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter for a variety of reasons including 

• prospective clients’ contracting decisions are often made in the last few weeks of a quarter 

• the size of license transactions can vary significantly 

• clients may unexpectedly postpone or cancel procurement processes due to changes in strategic priorities project objectives budget or personnel 

• client purchasing processes vary significantly and a client’s internal approval expenditure authorization and contract negotiation processes can be difficult and time consuming to complete even after selection of a vendor 

• the number timing and significance of software product enhancements and new software product announcements by us and our competitors may affect purchase decisions 

• we may have to defer revenues under our revenue recognition policies and gaap 

• clients may elect subscriptionbased arrangements which result in lower software license revenues in the initial year as compared to traditional onpremise software license arrangements but generate higher overall subscriptionbased revenues over the term of the contract 

in each fiscal quarter our expense levels operating costs and hiring plans are based to some extent on projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed if our actual revenues fall below expectations we could experience a reduction in operating results also if actual revenues or earnings for any given quarter fall below expectations it may lead to a decline in our stock price 

increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins 

we realize lower margins on software and appraisal service revenues than on license revenue the majority of our contracts include both software licenses and software services therefore an increase in the percentage of software service and appraisal service revenue compared to license revenue could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and could adversely affect operating results 

increases in investment in research and development could decrease overall margins 

an important element of our corporate strategy is to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development and related product and service opportunities both through internal investments and the acquisition of intellectual property from companies that we have acquired we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position and research and development expenses could adversely affect operating margins 

our stock price may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile examples of factors that may significantly impact our stock price include 

• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results 

• announcements of technological innovations new products or new contracts by us or our competitors 

• developments with respect to patents copyrights or other proprietary rights 

• conditions and trends in the software and other technology industries 

• adoption of new accounting standards 

• changes in financial estimates by securities analysts 

• general market conditions and other factors 

in addition the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of technology company stocks and may in the future adversely affect the market price of our stock sometimes securities class action litigation is filed following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities we cannot assure you that similar litigation will not occur in the future with respect to us such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect upon our financial performance 

our financial outlook may not be realized 

from time to time in press releases and otherwise we may publish forecasts or other forwardlooking statements regarding our results including estimated revenues or earnings any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties and as a matter of course any number of them may prove to be incorrect further the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors including those described in this discussion many of which are beyond our control as a result we cannot be certain that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse current and potential stockholders are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions but instead are encouraged to utilize our entire publicly available mix of historical and forwardlooking information as well as other available information regarding us our products and services and the software industry when evaluating our prospective results of operations 

risks associated with our growth strategy and other general corporate risks 

we may experience difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy 

a material portion of our historical growth has resulted from strategic acquisitions although our focus is on internal growth we will continue to identify and pursue strategic acquisitions with suitable candidates these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including risks that a transaction does not advance our business strategy that we do not achieve the expected return on our investment that we have difficulty integrating business systems and technology that we have difficulty retaining or integrating new employees that the transactions distract management from our other businesses that we acquire unforeseen liabilities and other unanticipated events our future success will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate future acquisitions into our operations it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits of these transactions such as increased revenue enhanced efficiencies or increased market share or the benefits may be ultimately less than we expected although we conduct due diligence reviews of potential acquisition candidates we may not identify all material liabilities or risks related to acquisition candidates there can be no assurance that any such strategic acquisitions will be accomplished on favorable terms or will result in profitable operations 

our failure to properly manage growth could adversely affect our business 

we continue to expand our operations by pursuing existing and potential market opportunities this growth places significant demands on management and operational resources in order to manage growth effectively we must implement and improve our operational systems procedures and controls on a timely basis if we fail to implement these systems our business may be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to hire integrate and retain qualified personnel 

our continued success will depend upon the availability and performance of our key management sales marketing client support and product development personnel the loss of key management or technical personnel could adversely affect us we believe that our continued success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract integrate and retain such personnel we have at times experienced and continue to experience challenges in recruiting qualified personnel competition for qualified software development sales and other personnel is intense and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance may result in additional expenses 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance compliance and public disclosure can create uncertainty for public companies the costs required to comply with such evolving laws across the various states and at the federal level are difficult to predict andor harmonize to maintain high standards of corporate governance compliance and public disclosure we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standardsthis investment may result in an unforeseen increase in general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenuegenerating activities which may harm our operating results 

we don’t foresee paying dividends on our common stock 

we have not declared nor paid a cash dividend since we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector in 1998 we intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law could deter takeover attempts 

our board of directors may issue up to 1000000 shares of preferred stock and may determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting and conversion rights of these preferred shares these determinations may be made without any further vote or action by our stockholders the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock in addition some provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and the delaware general corporation law could also delay prevent or make more difficult a merger tender offer or proxy contest involving us

overview 

general 

we provide integrated information management solutions and services for the public sector with a focus on local governments we develop and market a broad line of software products and services to address the it needs of cities counties schools and other local government entities in addition we provide professional it services to our clients including software and hardware installation data conversion training and for certain clients product modifications along with continuing maintenance and support for clients using our systems we also provide subscriptionbased services such as software as a service “saas” which primarily utilize the tyler private cloud and electronic document filing solutions “efiling” which simplify the filing and management of court related documents revenues for efiling are derived from transaction fees and in some cases fixed fee arrangements other transactionbased fees primary relate to online payment services we also provide property appraisal outsourcing services for taxing jurisdictions 

our products generally automate eight major functional areas 1 financial management and education 2 courts and justice 3 public safety 4 property appraisal and tax 5 planning regulatory and maintenance 6 land and vital records management 7 data and insights and 8 platform technologies we report our results in two segments the enterprise software es segment provides public sector entities with software systems and services to meet their information technology and automation needs for missioncritical “backoffice” functions such as financial management and education courts and justice public safety planning regulatory and maintenance data and insights and platform technologies the appraisal and tax “at” segment provides systems and software that automate the appraisal and assessment of real and personal property land and vital records management as well as property appraisal outsourcing services for local governments and taxing authorities property appraisal outsourcing services include the physical inspection of commercial and residential properties data collection and processing computer analysis for property valuation preparation of tax rolls community education and arbitration between taxpayers and the assessing jurisdiction 

as of january 1 2020 the land and vital records management business unit which was previously reported in the es segment was moved to the at segment to reflect changes in the way in which management makes operating decisions allocates resources and manages the growth and profitability of the company prior year amounts for the es and at segments have been adjusted to reflect the segment change see note 14  segment and related information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 total revenues increased 28 compared to the prior year excluding the impact of acquisitions total revenues increased 14 compared to prior year revenues from acquisitions contributed 14 of growth for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 

subscriptions revenue grew 183 for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 due to a gradual shift toward cloudbased software as a service business as well as continued strong growth in our transactionbased revenues from online payments and efiling revenues from courts excluding the impact of recent acquisitions subscriptions revenue increased 172 for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 

our backlog at december 31 2020 was 159 billion a 94 increase from last year 

we monitor and analyze several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance these indicators include the following 

revenues – we derive our revenues from five primary sources sale of software licenses and royalties subscriptionbased arrangements software services maintenance and appraisal services subscriptions and maintenance are considered recurring revenue sources and comprised approximately 733 of our revenue in 2020 the number of new saas clients and the number of existing clients who convert from our traditional software arrangements to our saas model are a significant driver of our revenue growth together with new software license sales and maintenance rate increases in addition we also monitor our customer base and churn as we historically have experienced very low customer turnover during 2020 based on our number of customers turnover was approximately 2 

cost of revenues and gross margins – our primary cost component is personnel expenses in connection with providing software implementation subscriptionbased services maintenance and support and appraisal services to our clients we can improve gross margins by controlling headcount and related costs and by expanding our revenue base especially from those products and services that produce incremental revenue with minimal incremental cost such as software licenses and royalties subscriptionbased services and maintenance and support our appraisal projects are cyclical in nature and we often employ appraisal personnel on a shortterm basis to coincide with the life of a project as of december 31 2020 our total employee count increased to 5536 from 5368 at december 31 2019 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses – the primary components of sga expenses are administrative and sales personnel salaries and commissions sharebased compensation expense marketing expense rent and professional fees sales commissions typically fluctuate with revenues and sharebased compensation expense generally increases as the market price of our stock increases other administrative expenses tend to grow at a slower rate than revenues 

liquidity and cash flows – the primary driver of our cash flows is net income uses of cash include acquisitions capital investments in property and equipment and discretionary purchases of treasury stock our working capital needs are fairly stable throughout the year with the significant components of cash outflows being payment of personnel expenses offset by cash inflows representing collection of accounts receivable and cash receipts from clients in advance of revenue being earned in recent years we have also received significant amounts of cash from employees exercising stock options and contributing to our employee stock purchase plan 

balance sheet – cash accounts receivable and days sales outstanding and deferred revenue balances are important indicators of our business 

impact of the covid19 pandemic 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of a covid19 pandemic which continues to spread throughout the us and the world and has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to contain the virus including travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelterinplace orders and business limitations and shutdowns while we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that covid19 will have on our results from operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties including the duration and severity of the pandemic and containment measures and associated compliance the current environment has negatively impacted our revenues for fiscal year 2020 

because an increasing portion of our revenues are recurring the effect of covid19 on our results of operations may also not be fully reflected for some time we continue to see some impact on our business in the near term with delays in government procurement processes and uncertainty around public sector budgets as well as delays in implementations caused by travel restrictions closed offices or clients shifting focus to more pressing issues we have addressed those challenges through adapting the way we do business – encouraging web and video conferencing conducting virtual sales demonstrations and delivering professional services remotely 

our priorities during this crisis are protecting the health and safety of our employees and our clients our it systems and applications support a remote workforce prior to the pandemic many of our employees worked remotely in response to the pandemic we encouraged all employees who are able to do so to work from home equipping them with resources necessary to continue uninterrupted we were able to transition the vast majority of our employees to this workfromhome posture this reduces the number of team members in our offices to those uniquely needed for essential onsite services such as network operations support staff and allows for “social distancing” as directed by the centers for disease control cdc 

the pandemic has delayed some government procurement processes and is expected to impact our ability to complete certain implementations negatively impacting our revenue it could also negatively impact the timing of client payments to us we continue to monitor these trends in order to respond to the everchanging impact of covid19 on our clients and tyler’s operations 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 the impact of the covid19 pandemic resulted in lower revenues from software licenses software services appraisal services and other revenues lower software licenses compared to prior periods are attributed to slower sales cycles as government procurement processes are delayed and contract signings have been pushed to future periods software services and appraisal services revenue declines are attributed to delays in implementations caused by travel restrictions and shelterinplace orders in effect during the period other revenues were lower compared to prior periods primarily as a result of the cancellation of our 2020 connect user conference lower revenues compared to prior periods were offset by cost savings attributed to lower spend on travel user conferences and trade show expenses health claims and other employeerelated expenses if and as travel restrictions are relaxed we expect software services and appraisal services revenues to increase as the limited number of our clients who require that all or a portion of their services be delivered onsite will be able to receive those services also we are adapting by changing the way we do business encouraging web and video conferencing conducting virtual sales demonstrations and delivering professional services remotely which result in increases in staff utilization rates and billable time 

recurring revenues from subscriptions and maintenance comprised 733 of our total consolidated revenue for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 and include transactionbased revenue streams such as efiling and online payments as of december 31 2020 we had 7585 million in cash and investments and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility we also have substantial additional liquidity available through our undrawn 400 million credit facility which can be expanded through an accordion feature during the second quarter of 2020 we completed our annual assessment of goodwill which did not result in an impairment charge since our assessment in the second quarter of 2020 we have recorded no impairment to goodwill as no triggering events or changes in circumstances occurred as of periodend no impairments of other assets were recorded as of the balance sheet date as no triggering events or changes in circumstances indicating a potential impairment have occurred as of periodend to require such an impairment however due to significant uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and market conditions management’s judgment regarding this could change in the future 

security incident 

on september 29 2020 we filed a current report on form 8k reporting a security incident the incident involving ransomware disrupting access to some of our internal it systems and telephone systems there is no evidence that the environments where we host client applications were affected and our hosting services to those clients were not interrupted there is also no evidence of malicious activity on client networks associated with the incident we contained the incident and recovered from it resuming normal operations with our clients we will continue to deploy supplemental remediation efforts as necessary 

as part of our immediate response to the incident we 1 shut down points of access to external systems and began investigating and remediating the problem 2 engaged outside it security and forensics experts to conduct a detailed review and help securely restore affected systems 3 implemented targeted monitoring systems to supplement the systems we already had in place and 4 notified law enforcement we are have cooperated with their investigation throughout 

we promptly notified our clients of the incident and provided timely updates to our clients through direct communications and updates to our website 

although we believe we have contained and recovered from the incident and that we have taken and will continue to take appropriate remediation steps we are subject to risk and uncertainties as a result of the incident we believe we are in the final phases of our investigation but there can be no assurance as to what the ongoing impact of the incident will be if any the incident caused an interruption in parts of our business we estimate that as a result of the incident revenue primarily software services for the year ended december 31 2020 was reduced by approximately 15 million however insurance reimbursements pertaining to lost revenue represent a contingent gain and any recovery of these revenues will be recorded when received we incurred 42 million in costs associated with the incident as of december 31 2020 as of december 31 2020 we have recorded 11 million of accrued insurance recoveries and received 24 million of insurance recoveries related to the incident the recorded costs consisted primarily of payments to thirdparty service providers and consultants including legal fees and enhancements to our cybersecurity measures it is expected that we will continue to incur costs related to our response remediation and investigatory efforts relating to the incident we maintain cybersecurity insurance coverage in an amount that we believe is adequate 

recent adoption of new accounting pronouncements 

in june 2016 the fasb issued asu 201613 financial instruments  credit losses “asu 201613” asu 201613 changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments including trade and other receivables available forsale debt securities heldtomaturity debt securities and loans and requires entities to use a new forwardlooking expected loss model that will result in the earlier recognition of an allowance for losses this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 including interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted for a fiscal year beginning after december 15 2018 including interim periods within that fiscal year entities apply the standard’s provisions as a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted as of january 1 2020 we adopted the new standard with no material impact of credit losses to our trade and other receivables heldtomaturity debt securities and retained earnings included in our consolidated financial statements 

o n january 26 2017 the fasb issued asu no 201704 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment  the new standard eliminates step 2 from the goodwill impairment test an entity should recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value this standard is effective for public business entities in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 and the standard was adopted and applied prospectively by the company as of january 1 2020 but it did not have a significant impact on the companys financial statements and disclosures 

recent accounting guidance not yet adopted 

in december 2019 the fasb issued asu 201912 simplifying the accounting for income taxes  asu 201912 which simplifies the accounting for income taxes eliminates certain exceptions within asc 740 income taxes  and clarifies certain aspects of the current guidance to promote consistency among reporting entities the new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2020 most amendments within the standard are required to be applied on a prospective basis while certain amendments must be applied on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis we do not expect adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

outlook 

the local government software market continues to be active and our backlog at december 31 2020 reached 159 billion a 94 increase from the prior year we expect to continue to achieve solid growth in revenue and earnings with our strong financial position and cash flow we plan to continue to make significant investments in product development to better position us to continue to expand our addressable market and strengthen our competitive position in the public sector software market over the long term 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements the reported amounts of revenues cost of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosure of contingencies the notes to the financial statements included as part of this annual report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the application of the progress toward completion methods of revenue recognition estimated standalone selling price ssp for distinct performance obligations the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of intangible assets determination of sharebased compensation expense and valuation allowance for receivables we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition we earn revenue from software licenses royalties subscriptionbased services software services postcontract customer support “pcs” or “maintenance” hardware and appraisal services revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services we determine revenue recognition through the following steps 

• identification of the contract or contracts with a customer 

• identification of the performance obligations in the contract 

• determination of the transaction price 

• allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract 

• recognition of revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation 

most of our software arrangements with customers contain multiple performance obligations that range from software licenses installation training and consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs services hosting and pcs for these contracts we account for individual performance obligations separately when they are distinct we evaluate whether separate performance obligations can be distinct or should be accounted for as one performance obligation arrangements that include software services such as training or installation are evaluated to determine whether the customer can benefit from the services either on their own or together with other resources readily available to the customer and whether the services are separately identifiable from other promises in the contract many of our software arrangements involve “offtheshelf” software we recognize the revenue allocable to offtheshelf software licenses and specified upgrades at a point in time when control of the software license transfers to the customer unless the software is not considered distinct we consider offtheshelf software to be distinct when it can be added to an arrangement with minor changes in the underlying code it can be used by the customer for the customer’s purpose upon installation and remaining services such as training are not considered highly interdependent or highly interrelated to the products functionality 

for arrangements that involve significant production modification or customization of the software or where software services are otherwise not considered distinct we recognize revenue over time by measuring progresstocompletion we measure progresstocompletion primarily using labor hours incurred as it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts these arrangements are often implemented over an extended period and occasionally require us to revise total cost estimates amounts recognized in revenue are calculated using the progresstocompletion measurement after giving effect to any changes in our cost estimates changes to total estimated contract costs if any are recorded in the period they are determined estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which we first determine that a loss is apparent when software services are distinct the fee allocable to the service element is recognized over the time we perform the services and is billed on a time and material or milestones basis 

subscriptionbased services consist of revenues derived from saas arrangements which primarily utilize the tyler private cloud and electronic filing transactions revenue from subscriptionbased services is generally recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer for saas arrangements we evaluate whether the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and whether the customer can feasibly maintain the software on the customer’s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a thirdparty to host the software we allocate contract value to each performance obligation of the arrangement that qualifies for treatment as a distinct element based on estimated ssp we recognize saas arrangements ratably over the term of the arrangement which range from one to ten years but are typically for a period of three to five years for software services associated with certain saas arrangements we have concluded that the services are not distinct and we recognize the revenue ratably over the remaining contractual period once we have provided the customer access to the software we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 

the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative ssp basis we determine the ssp based on our overall pricing objectives taking into consideration market conditions and other factors including the value of our contracts the applications sold customer demographics and the number and types of users within our contracts we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services in instances where ssp is not directly observable such as when we do not sell the product or service separately we determine ssp using the expected costplus margin approach revenue is recognized net of allowances for sales adjustments and any taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities 

typically the structure of our arrangements does not give rise to variable consideration however in those instances whereby variable consideration exists we include in our estimates additional revenue for variable consideration when we believe we have an enforceable right the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable 

we maintain allowances for losses and sales adjustments which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized since most of our customers are domestic governmental entities we rarely incur a loss resulting from credit risk associated with the inability of a customer to make required payments events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for losses and sales adjustments may require revision include but are not limited to deterioration of a customer’s financial condition failure to manage our customer’s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products the allowance for losses and sales adjustments reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance we determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts historical experience and other currently available evidence our allowance for losses and sales adjustments of 93 million and 57 million at december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 respectively does not include provisions for credit losses as of january 1 2020 we adopted asu 201613 and primarily evaluated our historical experience with credit losses related to trade and other receivables because we have not experienced any historical credit losses with the majority of our clients we have no basis to record a reserve for credit losses as defined by the standard 

in connection with certain of our contracts we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet date many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period we review unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue in addition we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue which represents billings in excess of revenue earned the majority of this liability consists of maintenance billings for which payments are made in advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the maintenance period generally one year we also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit and the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product have not been met on a periodic basis we review by customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains appropriate 

intangible assets and goodwill  our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge the cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value with the excess allocated to goodwill accordingly we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets including software customer related intangibles trade name leases and goodwill these intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives we currently have no intangible assets with indefinite lives other than goodwill 

we assess goodwill for impairment annually as of april 1st or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable we begin with the qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying value before applying the quantitative assessment described below when testing goodwill for impairment quantitatively we first compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized the fair values calculated in our impairment tests are determined using discounted cash flow models involving several assumptions the assumptions that are used are based upon what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain we evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by comparing the total of the fair value of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization 

during the second quarter as part of our annual impairment test we performed qualitative assessments for all reporting units except for the data and insights reporting unit as a result of these qualitative assessments we determined that it was not more likely than not that an impairment existed therefore we did not perform a step 1 quantitative impairment test we did perform a quantitative assessment for goodwill of 757 million associated with our data and insights business unit and concluded no impairment existed as of our annual assessment date for most of our reporting units goodwill relates to a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result those units have fair values that substantially exceed their underlying carrying values for other reporting units in particular our platform technologies and data and insights business units goodwill entirely relates to recently acquired businesses and as a result those units do not have significant excess fair values over carrying values the platform technologies and data and insights business units combined goodwill was 1520 million or 18 of total goodwill as of december 31 2020 our annual goodwill impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge during 2020 we have recorded no impairment to goodwill as no triggering events or changes in circumstances indicating a potential impairment have occurred as of periodend 

determining the fair value of our reporting units involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty changes in market conditions or other factors outside of our control such as the covid19 pandemic could cause us to change key assumptions and our judgment about a reporting unit’s prospects similarly in a specific period a reporting unit could significantly underperform relative to its historical or projected future operating results either situation could result in a meaningfully different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units and a consequent future impairment charge 

all intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of other intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows the assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved such indicators may include among others a significant decline in expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition and reductions in growth rates in addition products capabilities or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or noncompetitive any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets during 2020 we did not identify any triggering events that would indicate that the carrying amount of our intangible assets may not be recoverable 

sharebased compensation we have a stock incentive plan that provides for the grant of stock options restricted stock units and performance stock units to key employees directors and nonemployee consultants we estimate the fair value of sharebased awards on the date of grant sharebased compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures which will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from such estimates changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data 

we estimate stock price volatility at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock estimated option life is determined using the weightedaverage period the stock options are expected to be outstanding based primarily on the options’ vesting terms remaining contractual life and the employees’ expected exercise based on historical patterns determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates 

analysis of results of operations and other 

the following discussion compares the historical results of operations on a basis consistent with gaap for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 



2020 compared to 2019 

revenues 

on february 28 2019 we acquired all of the capital stock of micropact a leading provider of cots solutions including entellitrak® a lowcode application development platform for case management and business process management used extensively in the public sector the following table details revenue for micropact for the periods presented as of december 31 2020 and 2019 which is included in our consolidated statements of income from the date of acquisition 



software licenses and royalties 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software licenses and royalties revenue for the years ended december 31 



software licenses and royalties revenue decreased 27 compared to the prior year the decline is primarily due to longer sales cycles attributed to our erp public safety and appraisal software products as the impact of covid19 has slowed government procurement processes and some contract signings have been pushed to future periods software licenses revenue was also negatively impacted by delayed deliveries attributed to the it security incident that occurred in late september 2020 also contributing to the decline is the shift in the mix of new software contracts toward more subscriptionbased agreements compared to the prior year our total new client mix in 2020 was approximately 38 perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 62 subscriptionbased arrangements compared to total new client mix in 2019 of approximately 46 perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 54 subscriptionbased arrangements 

although the mix of new contracts between subscriptionbased and perpetual license arrangements may vary from quarter to quarter and year to year we expect our longerterm software license growth rate to be negatively impacted by a growing number of customers choosing our subscriptionbased options rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement subscriptionbased arrangements result in lower software license revenue in the initial year as compared to perpetual software license arrangements but generate higher overall revenue over the term of the contract 

subscriptions 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our subscriptions revenue for the years ended december 31 



subscriptionbased revenue primarily consists of revenue derived from our saas arrangements which generally utilize the tyler private cloud as part of our subscriptionbased services we also provide electronic document filing solutions “efiling” that simplify the filing and management of court related documents for courts and law offices efiling revenue is derived from transaction fees and fixed fee arrangements 

subscriptionbased revenue increased 18 compared to 2019 new saas clients as well as existing clients who converted to our saas model provided the majority of the subscription revenue increase in 2020 we added 488 new saas clients and 157 existing clients elected to convert to our saas model also transactionbased fees contributed 77 million to the increase in subscription revenue due to the increased volumes of online payments from utility billings and slightly increased efiling services volumes in 2020 

software services 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software services revenue for the years ended december 31 



software services revenue primarily consists of professional services billed in connection with implementing our software converting client data training client personnel custom development activities and consulting new clients who purchase our proprietary software licenses or subscriptions generally also contract with us to provide for the related software services existing clients also periodically purchase additional training consulting and minor programming services 

software services revenue decreased 13 compared to the prior year period the decline in software services is due to delays in client implementations caused by covid19 travel restrictions and shelterinplace orders and a decline in billable travel revenue as most services are now being delivered virtually rather than onsite software services revenue was also lower due to interruptions caused by the it security incident that occurred in late september 2020 we estimate that as a result of the incident revenue primarily software services was reduced by approximately 15 million in 2020 however insurance reimbursements pertaining to lost revenue represent a contingent gain and any recovery of these revenues will be recorded when received also contributing to the decline is the increase of clients selecting our cloud solutions instead of our onpremises license arrangements which typically require more professional services 

maintenance 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our maintenance revenue for the years ended december 31 



we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and certain thirdparty software maintenance revenue grew 9 compared to the prior year maintenance revenue increased mainly due to contributions of maintenance revenue from recent acquisitions and completing the recognition of the majority of acquisitionrelated deferred maintenance revenue that was fair valued at rates below tylers average maintenance rate in prior periods the remainder of the increase is attributed to annual maintenance rate increases and growth in our installed customer base from new software license sales partially offset by attrition and clients converting from onpremises license arrangements to saas 

appraisal services 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our appraisal services revenue for the years ended december 31 



in 2020 appraisal services revenue decreased 10 compared to the prior year primarily due to the delays to several ongoing projects as a result of travel restrictions and shelterinplace orders related to covid19 the appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states 

cost of revenues and gross margins 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues for the years ended december 31 



the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the years ended december 31 



software licenses royalties and acquired software  cost of software licenses royalties and acquired software is primarily comprised of amortization expense for acquired software and thirdparty software costs we do not have any direct costs associated with royalties the gross margin decrease of 137 is due to lower revenue from software licenses compared to the prior period 

subscriptions software services and maintenance  cost of subscriptions software services and maintenance primarily consists of personnel costs related to installation of our software conversion of client data training client personnel and support activities and various other services such as custom client development and ongoing operation of saas and efiling arrangements in 2020 the subscriptions software services and maintenance gross margin increased 26 compared to the prior year margins have increased primarily due to a reduction in software services revenues from reimbursable travel that has little to no margin as well as improved utilization of our professional services staff resulting from the shift to virtual delivery of most implementation services offset somewhat by the reduction in software services revenues as a result of the incident in late september 2020 our implementation and support staff grew by 131 employees since december 31 2019 as we increased hiring to ensure that we are wellpositioned to deliver our current backlog and anticipated new business costs related to maintenance and various other services such as saas and efiling typically grow at a slower rate than related revenue due to leverage in the utilization of support and maintenance staff and economies of scale 

appraisal services  appraisal services revenue comprised approximately 19 of total revenue the appraisal services gross margin decreased 102 compared to 2019 due to lower staff utilization as a result of covid19 travel restrictions and shelterinplace orders in place during the current period the appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states 

our 2020 blended gross margin increased 10 compared to 2019 the slight increase in overall gross margin is attributed to a higher revenue mix for subscription revenues compared to the prior year periods resulting in an increase in incremental margin related to subscriptions software services and maintenance margins have also increased due a reduction in software services revenue from reimbursable travel that has little to no margin as well as improved utilization of our professional services staff resulting from the shift to virtual delivery of most implementation services offset somewhat by the reduction in software services revenues as a result of the incident in late september 2020 costs related to maintenance and various other services such as saas and efiling typically grow at a slower rate than related revenue due to leveraging utilization of support and maintenance staff and economies of scale in addition the cancellation of our connect user conference scheduled for april 2020 and the related elimination of approximately 6 million of revenues with no associated margin also had a positive impact on our overall gross margin these increases in overall gross margins are partially offset by lower margins from software licenses due to lower software license revenue as well as lower staffing utilization attributable to appraisal services 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses consist primarily of salaries employee benefits travel sharebased compensation expense commissions and related overhead costs for administrative and sales and marketing employees as well as professional fees trade show activities advertising costs and other marketing related costs the following table sets forth a comparison of our sga expenses for the years ended december 31 



sga as a percentage of revenue was 232 in 2020 compared to 237 in 2019 sga expense increased approximately 1 compared to the prior year period the increase in sga expense is attributed to increased stock compensation expense compared to the prior period during 2020 stock compensation expense rose 43 million compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in sharebased awards issued in connection with our stock compensation plan coupled with the higher fair value of each sharebased award due to the increase in our stock price these increases in sga were offset by lower bonus and commission expense as a result of lower 

sales lower travel expenses associated with sales and marketing activities including trade shows as a result of covid19 travel restrictions and lower health claim expenses during the current period 

research and development expense 

research and development expense consists primarily of salaries employee benefits and related overhead costs associated with new product development the following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the years ended december 31 



research and development expense consists mainly of costs associated with development of new products and technologies from which we do not currently generate significant revenue 

research and development expense increased 9 in 2020 compared to the prior year period mainly due to a number of new tyler product development initiatives across our product suites including increased investments in research and development at recently acquired businesses to support these initiatives our research and development staff grew by 38 since december 31 2019 

amortization of customer and trade name intangibles 

acquisition intangibles are comprised of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that is allocated to acquired software leases and customer and trade name intangibles the remaining excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues while amortization expense of customer and trade name intangibles is recorded as operating expense the estimated useful lives of both customer and trade name intangibles range from five to 25 years the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the years ended december 31 



amortization of customer and trade name intangibles increased due to the impact of intangibles added with several acquisitions completed in 2019 

estimated annual amortization expense relating to customer and trade name acquisition intangibles excluding acquired software for which the amortization expense is recorded as cost of revenues for the next five years and thereafter is as follows in thousands 



amortization expense relating to acquired leases will be recorded as a reduction to hardware and other revenue and is expected to be 525000 in 2021 525000 in 2022 525000 in 2023 525000 in 2024 397000 in 2025 and 114000 thereafter  

other 

the following table sets forth a comparison of other income net for the years ended december 31 



other income is comprised of interest income from invested cash net of interest expense and nonusage and other fees associated with our revolving credit agreement the decrease in other income net compared to the prior period is attributable to the significant decrease in interest rates on cash balances since march 2020 partially offset by higher levels of invested cash 

income tax provision 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the years ended december 31 



the decrease in the income tax provision and the effective income tax rate in 2020 compared to the prior year is primarily due to higher excess tax benefits of sharebased compensation in 2020 the sharebased exercise and vesting activity in 2020 generated excess tax benefits of 602 million while exercise and vesting activity in 2019 generated 298 million of excess tax benefits excluding the impact of the excess tax benefits our income tax provision and effective tax rate in 2020 would have been 404 million and 231 and in 2019 would have been 431 million and 270 respectively 

the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act which was signed into law on march 27 2020 provides an estimated 22 trillion to fight the covid19 pandemic and stimulate the us economy the assistance includes tax relief and government loans and investments and grants for entities in affected industries eg health care airlines the business tax provisions of the cares act include temporary changes to income and nonincome based tax laws including the ability to utilize net operating losses interest expense deductions alternative minimum tax credit refunds charitable contributions and depreciation of qualified improvement property measures not related to incomebased taxes include 1 allowing an employer to pay its share of social security payroll taxes that would otherwise be due from the date of enactment through december 31 2020 over the following two years and 2 allowing eligible employers subject to closure due to the covid19 pandemic to receive a 50 credit on qualified wages against their employment taxes each quarter with any excess credits eligible for refunds 

the most significant provision of the cares act impacting our accounting for income taxes is the fiveyear carryback allowance for taxable net operating losses generated in tax years in which the statutory federal income tax rate is 210 to periods in which the statutory federal income tax rate is 350 we intend to carry back our 2020 taxable loss into our 2015 tax year which results in a 34 million income tax benefit in the current year 

the effective income tax rates in both 2020 and 2019 differed from the united states federal statutory corporate income tax rate of 21 primarily due to state income taxes the research tax credit nondeductible sharebased compensation expense disqualifying incentive stock award dispositions and other nondeductible business expenses the 2020 effective income tax rate also includes the tax benefit of the fiveyear carryback of the federal net operating loss allowed under the cares act 

financial condition and liquidity 

as of december 31 2020 we had cash and cash equivalents of 6036 million compared to 2327 million at december 31 2019 we also had 1548 million invested in investment grade corporate bonds municipal bonds and assetbacked securities as of december 31 2020 compared to 816 million at december 31 2019 these investments mature from 2021 through 2028 and we intend to hold these investments until maturity cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with several domestic banks and money market funds as of december 31 2020 we had no outstanding borrowings and one outstanding letter of credit totaling 20 million in favor of a client contract we believe our revolving line of credit cash from operating activities cash on hand and access to the credit markets provide us with sufficient flexibility to meet our longterm financial needs 

the following table sets forth a summary of cash flows for the years ended december 31 



net cash provided by operating activities continues to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures other potential capital resources include cash on hand public and private issuances of debt or equity securities and bank borrowings it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets in the future may be limited by economic conditions or other factors we currently believe that cash provided by operating activities cash on hand and available credit are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures income tax obligations and share repurchases for at least the next twelve months 

in 2020 operating activities provided cash of 3551 million compared to 2547 million in 2019 operating activities that provided cash were primarily comprised of net income of 1948 million noncash depreciation and amortization charges of 817 million noncash sharebased compensation expense of 674 million and noncash decrease in operating lease rightofuse assets of 58 million working capital excluding cash decreased approximately 19 million due to higher accounts receivable resulting from an increase in unbilled receivables attributed to revenues recognized prior to billings higher accounts receivable related to annual maintenance and subscription billings timing of income tax payments and the deferred taxes associated with stock option activity during the period these increases were offset by the growth in deferred revenue balances and timing of payments of payroll related taxes and vendor invoices 

in general changes in the balance of deferred revenue are cyclical and primarily driven by the timing of our maintenance and subscription billings our renewal dates occur throughout the year but our largest maintenance renewal cycles occur in the second and fourth quarters 

days sales outstanding in accounts receivable were 121 days at december 31 2020 compared to 117 days at december 31 2019 the increase in our dso is mainly due to an increase in unbilled receivables attributed to the increase in software license revenue for which we have recognized revenue at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer but the billing has not yet been submitted to the customer an increase in software services contracts accounted for using progresstocompletion method of revenue recognition in which the services are performed in one accounting period but the billing normally occurs subsequently in another accounting period also contributed to the increase in dso furthermore our maintenance billing cycle typically peaks at its highest level in june and second highest level in december of each year and is followed by collections in the subsequent quarter dso is calculated based on quarterend accounts receivable excluding longterm receivables but including unbilled receivables divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by 360 days

market overview 

the state and local government market is one of the largest and most decentralized it markets in the country consisting of all 50 states approximately 3000 counties 36000 cities and towns and 13600 school districts this market is also comprised of approximately 37000 special districts and other agencies each with specialized delegated responsibilities and unique information management requirements 

traditionally local government bodies and agencies performed statemandated duties including property assessment record keeping road maintenance law enforcement administration of election and judicial functions and the provision of welfare assistance today a host of emerging and urgent issues are confronting local governments each of which demands a service response these areas include criminal justice and corrections administration and finance public safety health and human services planning regulatory and maintenance and records and document management transfers of responsibility from the federal and state governments to county and municipal governments and agencies in these and other areas also place additional service and financial requirements on these local government units in addition constituents of local governments are increasingly demanding improved service and better access to information from public entities as a result local governments recognize the increasing value of information management systems and services to among other things improve revenue collection provide increased access to information and streamline delivery of services to their constituents local government bodies are now recognizing that “egovernment” is an additional responsibility for community development from integrated tax systems to integrated civil and criminal justice information systems many counties and cities have benefited significantly from the implementation of jurisdictionwide systems that allow different agencies or government offices to share data and provide a more comprehensive approach to information management many city and county governmental agencies also have unique individual information management requirements which must be tailored to the specific functions of each particular office 

many local governments also have difficulties attracting and retaining the staff necessary to support their it functions as a result they seek to establish longterm relationships with reliable providers of high quality it products and services such as tyler 

although local governments often face budgetary constraints in their operations their primary revenue sources are usually property taxes and to a lesser extent utility billings and other fees which historically tend to be relatively stable in addition the acquisition of new technology typically enables local governments to operate more efficiently and often provides a measurable return on investment that justifies the purchase of software and related services

strategy 

our objective is to grow our revenue and earnings organically supplemented by focused strategic acquisitions the key components of our business strategy are to 

• provide high quality value–added products and services to our clients  we compete on the basis of among other things delivering to clients our deep domain expertise in local government operations through the highest value products and services in the market we believe we have achieved a reputation as a premium product and service provider to the local government market 

• continue to expand our product and service offerings  while we already have what we believe to be the broadest line of software products for local governments we continually upgrade our core software applications and expand our complementary product and service offerings to respond to technological advancements and the changing needs of our clients in 2010 we began providing efiling for courts and law offices which simplifies the filing and management of court related documents we believe revenue from efiling solutions will continue to grow over time as more local and state governments mandate electronic document filings we also offer solutions that allow the public to access data and conduct transactions with local governments such as paying traffic tickets property taxes and utility bills online we believe that the addition of such features enhances the market appeal of our core products we have also broadened our offerings of consulting and business process reengineering services 

• expand our client base  we seek to establish longterm relationships with new clients primarily through our sales and marketing efforts while we currently have clients in all 50 states canada the caribbean the united kingdom australia and other international locations not all of our solutions have achieved nationwide geographic penetration we intend to continue to expand into new geographic markets by adding sales staff and targeting marketing efforts by solutions in those areas we also intend to continue to expand our customer base to include more large governments while our traditional market focus has primarily been on small and midsized governments our increased size and market presence together with the technological advances and improved scalability of certain of our solutions are allowing us to achieve increasing success in selling to larger clients we also expect to expand our presence in international markets by leveraging our leadership position in the united states through the disciplined pursuit of selected opportunities in other countries 

• expand our existing client relationships  our existing customer base offers significant opportunities for additional sales of solutions and services that we currently offer but that existing clients do not fully utilize addon sales to existing clients typically involve lower sales and marketing expenses than sales to new clients 

• grow recurring revenues  we have a large recurring revenue base from maintenance and support and subscriptionbased services which generated revenues of 7267 million  or 67 of total revenues in 2019  we have historically experienced very low customer turnover approximately 2 annually and recurring revenues continue to grow as the installed customer base increases subscriptionbased revenues have been our fastest growing revenue category over the past five years increasing from 1119 million in 2015 to 2964 million in 2019  

• maximize economies of scale and take advantage of financial leverage in our business  we seek to build and maintain a larger client base to create economies of scale enabling us to provide valueadded products and services to our clients while expanding our operating margins because we sell primarily “offtheshelf” software increased sales of the same solutions result in incrementally higher gross margins in addition we believe that we have a marketing and administrative infrastructure in place that can be leveraged to accommodate significant longterm growth without proportionately increasing selling general and administrative expenses 

• attract and retain highly qualified employees  we believe that the depth and quality of our management and staff is one of our significant strengths and that the ability to retain such employees is crucial to our continued growth and success we believe that our stable management team financial strength and growth opportunities as well as our leadership position in the local government market enhance our attractiveness as an employer for highly skilled employees 

• pursue selected strategic acquisitions  while we expect to primarily grow internally from time to time we selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that provide us with one or more of the following 

 • establish strategic alliances  in october 2019 we announced a strategic collaboration agreement with amazon web services aws for cloud hosting services this agreement brings together tyler the nations largest software company exclusively focused on the public sector and aws the broadest and deepest cloud platform specifically the agreement with aws provides the framework for development training and collaboration in order to support nextgeneration applications that have the scalability resiliency and security aws offers it will assist tyler in accelerating innovation and the development of strategic initiatives these initiatives will bring the most advanced cloudnative services to tyler clients improving the flow of information and providing a better experience for state local and federal governments 

sales marketing and clients 

we market our products and services through direct sales and marketing personnel located throughout the united states other inhouse sales staff focus on addon sales professional services and support 

sales of new systems are typically generated from referrals from other government offices or departments within a county or municipality referrals from other local governments relationships established between sales representatives and county or local officials contacts at trade shows direct mailings and direct contact from prospects already familiar with us we are active in numerous national state county and local government associations and participate in annual meetings trade shows and educational events 

clients consist primarily of federal state county and municipal agencies school districts and other local government offices in counties clients include the auditor treasurer tax assessorcollector county clerk district clerk county and district court judges probation officers sheriff and county appraiser at municipal government sites clients include directors from various departments including administration finance utilities public works code enforcement personnel purchasing taxation municipal court and police contracts for software products and services are generally implemented over periods of three months to one year although some complex implementations may span multiple years with annually renewing maintenance and support update agreements thereafter although either the client or we can terminate these agreements historically almost all support and maintenance agreements are automatically renewed annually during 2019  approximately 40 of our revenue was attributable to ongoing support and maintenance agreements

we compete with numerous local regional and national firms that provide or offer some or many of the same solutions and services that we provide many of these competitors are smaller companies that may be able to offer less expensive solutions than ours many of these firms operate within a specific geographic area andor in a narrow product or service niche we also compete with national firms some of which have greater financial and technical resources than we do including oracle corporation infor sap ag workday inc centralsquare technologies thomson reuters corporation motorola solutions inc axon enterprise inc and constellation software inc in addition we sometimes compete with consulting and systems integration firms which develop custom systems primarily for larger governments we also occasionally compete with central internal information service departments of local governments which requires us to persuade the enduser department to discontinue service by its own personnel and outsource the service to us 

we compete on a variety of factors including price service name recognition reputation technological capabilities and the ability to modify existing products and services to accommodate the individual requirements of the client our ability to offer an integrated system of applications for several offices or departments is often a competitive advantage local governmental units often are required to seek competitive proposals through a request for proposal process and some prospective clients use consultants to assist them with the proposal and vendor selection process 

suppliers 

substantially all of the computers peripherals printers scanners operating system software office automation software and other equipment necessary for the implementation and provision of our software systems and services are presently available from several thirdparty sources hardware is purchased on original equipment manufacturer or distributor terms at discounts from retail we have not experienced any significant supply problems 

backlog 

at december 31 2019  our revenue backlog was approximately 146 billion  compared to 125 billion at december 31 2018  the backlog represents signed contracts under which the revenue has not been recognized as of yearend approximately 7206 million  or 49  of the backlog is expected to be recognized during 2020  

intellectual property proprietary rights and licenses 

we regard certain features of our internal operations software and documentation as confidential and proprietary and rely on a combination of contractual restrictions trade secret laws and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property we generally do not rely on patents we believe that due to the rapid rate of technological change in the computer software industry trade secrets and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as knowledge ability and experience of our employees frequent product enhancements and timeliness and quality of support services we typically license our software products under nonexclusive license agreements which are generally nontransferable and have a perpetual term 

employees 

at december 31 2019  we had 5368 employees none of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to collective bargaining agreements we consider our relations with our employees to be positive 

internet website and availability of public filings

risk factors 

tableend an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk investors evaluating our company should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this annual report any of the following factors could materially harm our business operating results and financial condition additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business operating results and financial condition this section should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report we may make forwardlooking statements from time to time both written and oral we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forwardlooking statements our actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forwardlooking statements due to a number of factors including those set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report 

risks associated with our software products 

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities can disrupt our business and harm our competitive position 

threats to it security can take a variety of forms individuals and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations including statesponsored organizations may take steps that pose threats to our clients and our it they may for example develop and deploy malicious software to attack our products and services andor gain access to our networks and data centers or act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks cyber threats are constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and clients breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications impair our ability to provide services to our clients and protect the privacy of their data result in product development delays compromise confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or otherwise adversely affect our business our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these evolving threats 

disclosure of personally identifiable information andor other sensitive client data could result in liability and harm our reputation 

we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information and other confidential information of our clients the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security despite our efforts to improve security controls it is possible our security controls over personal data our training of employees on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of sensitive client data that we store and manage disclosure of personally identifiable information andor other sensitive client data could result in liability and harm our reputation 

hosting services for some of our products are dependent upon the uninterrupted operation of data centers 

a material portion of our business is provided through software hosting services these hosting services depend on the uninterrupted operation of data centers and the ability to protect computer equipment and information stored in these data centers against damage that may be caused by natural disaster fire power loss telecommunications or internet failure acts of terrorism unauthorized intrusion computer viruses and other similar damaging events if any of our data centers were to become inoperable for an extended period we might be unable to fulfill our contractual commitments although we take what we believe to be reasonable precautions against such occurrences we can give no assurance that damaging events such as these will not result in a prolonged interruption of our services which could result in client dissatisfaction loss of revenue and damage to our business 

we run the risk of errors or defects with new products or enhancements to existing products 

our software products are complex and may contain errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released any such defects could result in a loss of revenues or delay market acceptance our license agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability however it is possible we may not always successfully negotiate such provisions in our client contracts or the limitation of liability provisions may not be effective due to existing or future federal state or local laws ordinances or judicial decisions although we maintain errors and omissions and general liability insurance and we try to structure contracts to limit liability we cannot assure you that a successful claim could not be made or would not have a material adverse effect on our future operating results 

we must timely respond to technological changes to be competitive 

the market for our products is characterized by technological change evolving industry standards in software technology changes in client requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments satisfy increasingly sophisticated client requirements and achieve market acceptance we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and costeffective manner the products capabilities or technologies developed by others could also render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to develop or acquire new software products or develop enhancements to existing products on a timely and costeffective basis or if such new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance 

we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights 

many of our product and service offerings incorporate proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of contracts copyrights and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology we cannot be certain that we have taken all appropriate steps to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property there has also been an apparent evolution in the legal standards and regulations courts and the us patent office may apply in favorably evaluating software patent rights we are not currently involved in any material intellectual property litigation however we may be a party to such litigation in the future to protect our proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us with respect to current or future products any claims or litigation with or without merit could be timeconsuming costly and a diversion to management any such claims and litigation could also cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements such royalty or licensing arrangements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all therefore litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business regardless of the final outcome of such litigation 

clients may elect to terminate our maintenance contracts and manage operations internally 

it is possible that our clients may elect to not renew maintenance contracts for our software trying instead to maintain and operate the software themselves using their perpetual license rights excluding software applications that we provide on a hosted or cloud basis alternatively clients may elect to drop maintenance on certain modules that they ultimately decide not to use this could adversely affect our revenues and profits additionally they may inadvertently allow our intellectual property or other information to fall into the hands of third parties including our competitors which could adversely affect our business 

material portions of our business require the internet infrastructure to be reliable 

part of our future success continues to depend on the use of the internet as a means to access public information and perform transactions electronically including for example electronic filing of court documents this in part requires ongoing maintenance of the internet infrastructure especially to prevent interruptions in service as well as additional development of that infrastructure this requires a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed data capacity security and timely development of complementary products for providing reliable internet access and services if this infrastructure fails to be sufficiently developed or be adequately maintained our business would be harmed because users may not be able to access our government portals 

risks associated with selling products and services into the public sector marketplace 

selling products and services into the public sector poses unique challenges 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of software and services to state county and city governments other federal or municipal agencies and other public entities we expect that sales to public sector clients will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues in the future we face many risks and challenges associated with contracting with governmental entities including 

 each of these risks is outside our control if we fail to adequately adapt to these risks and uncertainties our financial performance could be adversely affected 

a prolonged economic slowdown could harm our operations 

a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce demand for our software products and services governments may face financial pressures that could in turn affect our growth rate and profitability in the future there is no assurance that government spending levels will be unaffected by declining or stagnant general economic conditions and if budget shortfalls occur they may negatively impact government it spending and could adversely affect our business 

the open bidding process creates uncertainty in predicting future contract awards 

many governmental agencies purchase products and services through an open bidding process generally a governmental entity will publish an established list of requirements requesting potential vendors to propose solutions for the established requirements to respond successfully to these requests for proposals we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract the time required to establish operations for the proposed client and the likely terms of any other thirdparty proposals submitted we cannot guarantee that we will win any bids in the future through the request for proposal process or that any winning bids will ultimately result in contracts on favorable terms our failure to secure contracts through the open bidding process or to secure such contracts on favorable terms may adversely affect our revenue and gross margins 

we face significant competition from other vendors and potential new entrants into our markets 

we believe we are a leading provider of integrated solutions for the public sector however we face competition from a variety of software vendors that offer products and services similar to those offered by us as well as from companies offering to develop custom software we compete based on a number of factors including 

 we believe our market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors that vary in size product platform and product scope our competitors include consulting firms publicly held companies that focus on selected segments of the public sector market and a significant number of smaller privately held companies certain competitors have greater technical marketing and financial resources than we do we cannot assure you that such competitors will not develop products or offer services that are superior to our products or services or that achieve greater market acceptance 

we also compete with internal centralized it departments of governmental entities which requires us to persuade the enduser to stop the internal service and outsource to us in addition our clients and prospective clients could elect to provide information management services internally through new or existing departments which could reduce the market for our services 

we could face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the public sector software application market and new products and technologies are introduced increased competition could result in pricing pressure fewer client orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective clients it is possible that new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect upon our business 

fixedprice contracts may affect our profits 

some of our contracts are structured on a fixedprice basis which can lead to various risks including 

 if we do not adequately assess and manage these and other risks we may be subject to cost overruns and penalties which may harm our financial performance 

changes in the insurance markets may affect our business 

some of our clients primarily those for our property appraisal services require that we secure performance bonds before they will select us as their vendor in addition we have in the past been required to provide letters of credit as security for the issuance of a performance bond we cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure such performance bonds in the future on terms that are favorable to us if at all our inability to obtain performance bonds on favorable terms or at all could impact our future ability to win some contract awards particularly large property appraisal services contracts which could negatively impact revenues in addition the general insurance markets may experience volatility which may lead to future increases in our general and administrative expenses and negatively impact our operating results 

risks associated with our periodic results and stock price 

fluctuations in quarterly revenue could adversely impact our operating results and stock price 

our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter for a variety of reasons including 

 in each fiscal quarter our expense levels operating costs and hiring plans are based to some extent on projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed if our actual revenues fall below expectations we could experience a reduction in operating results also if actual revenues or earnings for any given quarter fall below expectations it may lead to a decline in our stock price 

increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins 

we realize lower margins on software and appraisal service revenues than on license revenue the majority of our contracts include both software licenses and software services therefore an increase in the percentage of software service and appraisal service revenue compared to license revenue could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and could adversely affect operating results 

increases in investment in research and development could decrease overall margins 

an important element of our corporate strategy is to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development and related product and service opportunities both through internal investments and the acquisition of intellectual property from companies that we have acquired we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position because we expense the majority of our research and development costs increased investment could adversely affect operating margins 

our stock price may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile examples of factors that may significantly impact our stock price include 



 in addition the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of technology company stocks and may in the future adversely affect the market price of our stock sometimes securities class action litigation is filed following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities we cannot assure you that similar litigation will not occur in the future with respect to us such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect upon our financial performance 

our financial outlook may not be realized 

from time to time in press releases and otherwise we may publish forecasts or other forwardlooking statements regarding our results including estimated revenues or earnings any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties and as a matter of course any number of them may prove to be incorrect further the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors including those described in this discussion many of which are beyond our control as a result we cannot be certain that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse current and potential stockholders are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions but instead are encouraged to utilize our entire publicly available mix of historical and forwardlooking information as well as other available information regarding us our products and services and the software industry when evaluating our prospective results of operations 

risks associated with our growth strategy and other general corporate risks 

we may experience difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy 

a material portion of our historical growth has resulted from strategic acquisitions although our focus is on internal growth we will continue to identify and pursue strategic acquisitions with suitable candidates these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including risks that a transaction does not advance our business strategy that we do not achieve the expected return on our investment that we have difficulty integrating business systems and technology that we have difficulty retaining or integrating new employees that the transactions distract management from our other businesses that we acquire unforeseen liabilities and other unanticipated events our future success will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate future acquisitions into our operations it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits of these transactions such as increased revenue enhanced efficiencies or increased market share or the benefits may be ultimately less than we expected although we conduct due diligence reviews of potential acquisition candidates we may not identify all material liabilities or risks related to acquisition candidates there can be no assurance that any such strategic acquisitions will be accomplished on favorable terms or will result in profitable operations 

our failure to properly manage growth could adversely affect our business 

we continue to expand our operations by pursuing existing and potential market opportunities this growth places significant demands on management and operational resources in order to manage growth effectively we must implement and improve our operational systems procedures and controls on a timely basis if we fail to implement these systems our business may be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to hire integrate and retain qualified personnel 

our continued success will depend upon the availability and performance of our key management sales marketing client support and product development personnel the loss of key management or technical personnel could adversely affect us we believe that our continued success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract integrate and retain such personnel we have at times experienced and continue to experience challenges in recruiting qualified personnel competition for qualified software development sales and other personnel is intense and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance may result in additional expenses 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance compliance and public disclosure can create uncertainty for public companies the costs required to comply with such evolving laws are difficult to predict to maintain high standards of corporate governance compliance and public disclosure we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards this investment may result in an unforeseen increase in general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenuegenerating activities which may harm our operating results 

we don’t foresee paying dividends on our common stock 

we have not declared nor paid a cash dividend since we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector in 1998 we intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law could deter takeover attempts 

our board of directors may issue up to 1000000 shares of preferred stock and may determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting and conversion rights of these preferred shares these determinations may be made without any further vote or action by our stockholders the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock in addition some provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and the delaware general corporation law could also delay prevent or make more difficult a merger tender offer or proxy contest involving us

recent acquisitions 

on october 30 2019 we acquired certain assets of courthouse technologies ltd cht an industryleading provider of jury management systems that offers a fully integrated endtoend softwareasaservice saas solution to manage all facets of juror management from source list generation to juror processing and payment the total purchase price was approximately 205 million of which 191 million was paid in cash and approximately 14 million was accrued for working capital and indemnity holdbacks subject to certain postclosing adjustments 

on february 28 2019 we acquired all of the capital stock of mp holdings parent inc dba micropact micropact a leading provider of commercial offtheshelf cots solutions including entellitrak® a lowcode application development platform for case management and business process management used extensively in the public sector the total purchase price net of cash acquired of 20 million  was approximately 2022 million consisting of 1982 million paid in cash and accrued contingent consideration of 60 million  subject to the achievement of certain financial performance objectives 

on february 1 2019 we acquired all the assets of civic llc mycivic a company that provides software solutions to connect communities the total purchase price was 37 million in cash 

as of december 31 2019  the purchase price allocations for micropact and mycivic are complete as of december 31 2019  the purchase price allocation for cht is not yet complete therefore the preliminary valuation estimates of fair value assumed at the acquisition date including intangible assets receivables and deferred revenue are subject to change as the valuation is finalized 

the operating results of all 2019 acquisitions are included with the operating results of the enterprise software segment since their date of acquisition revenues from micropact included in tylers results of operations totaled approximately 630 million and the net loss was approximately 98000 for the twelve months ended december 31 2019  the impact of the mycivic and cht acquisitions individually and in the aggregate on our operating results assets and liabilities is not material 

our balance sheet as of december 31 2019  reflects the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired based on their fair value at the date of each acquisition the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired are based on valuations using level iii unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 

we monitor and analyze several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance these indicators include the following 

revenues – we derive our revenues from five primary sources sale of software licenses and royalties subscriptionbased arrangements software services maintenance and appraisal services subscriptions and maintenance are considered recurring revenue sources and comprised approximately 67 of our revenue in 2019  the number of new saas clients and the number of existing clients who convert from our traditional software arrangements to our saas model are a significant driver to our business together with new software license sales and maintenance rate increases in addition we also monitor our customer base and churn as we historically have experienced very low customer turnover during 2019  based on our number of customers turnover was approximately 2  

cost of revenues and gross margins – our primary cost component is personnel expenses in connection with providing software implementation subscriptionbased services maintenance and support and appraisal services to our clients we can improve gross margins by controlling headcount and related costs and by expanding our revenue base especially from those products and services that produce incremental revenue with minimal incremental cost such as software licenses and royalties subscriptionbased services and maintenance and support our appraisal projects are cyclical in nature and we often employ appraisal personnel on a shortterm basis to coincide with the life of a project as of december 31 2019  our total employee count increased to 5368 from 4525 at december 31 2018  

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses – the primary components of sga expenses are administrative and sales personnel salaries and commissions sharebased compensation expense marketing expense rent and professional fees sales commissions typically fluctuate with revenues and sharebased compensation expense generally increases as the market price of our stock increases other administrative expenses tend to grow at a slower rate than revenues 

liquidity and cash flows – the primary driver of our cash flows is net income uses of cash include acquisitions capital investments in property and equipment and discretionary purchases of treasury stock our working capital needs are fairly stable throughout the year with the significant components of cash outflows being payment of personnel expenses offset by cash inflows representing collection of accounts receivable and cash receipts from clients in advance of revenue being earned in recent years we have also received significant amounts of cash from employees exercising stock options and contributing to our employee stock purchase plan 

balance sheet – cash accounts receivable and days sales outstanding and deferred revenue balances are important indicators of our business 

adoption of new lease accounting standard 

we adopted topic 842 using the transition method that allows us to initially apply the guidance at the adoption date of january 1 2019 and recognized a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption we used the package of practical expedients that allows us to not reassess 1 lease classification for any expired or existing leases and 2 initial direct costs for any expired or existing leases we did not elect to use the hindsight application for evaluating the life of lease arrangements the impact of adoption is reflected in the financial information herein for additional details see note 1  summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements in this report 

the impact of topic 842 on our consolidated balance sheet beginning january 1 2019 included the recognition of rightofuse rou assets and lease liabilities for operating leases while our accounting for finance leases remained substantially unchanged we had no finance leases prior to the adoption of topic 842 and currently do not have any

in june 2016 the fasb issued asu 201613 financial instruments  credit losses  “asu 201613” asu 201613 changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments including trade and other receivables heldtomaturity debt securities and loans and requires entities to use a new forwardlooking expected loss model that will result in the earlier recognition of allowance for losses this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 including interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted for a fiscal year beginning after december 15 2018 including interim periods within that fiscal year entities will apply the standard’s provisions as a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted we will adopt the new standard in the first quarter of 2020 and believe the impact on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations will not be material 

outlook 

the local government software market continues to be active and our backlog at december 31 2019 reached 146 billion  a 17 increase from last year we expect to continue to achieve solid growth in revenue and earnings with our strong financial position and cash flow we plan to continue to make significant investments in product development to better position us to continue to expand our addressable market and strengthen our competitive position in the public sector software market over the long term 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements the reported amounts of revenues cost of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosure of contingencies the notes to the financial statements included as part of this annual report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the application of the progress toward completion methods of revenue recognition estimated standalone selling price ssp for distinct performance obligations the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of intangible assets determination of sharebased compensation expense and valuation allowance for receivables we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition we earn revenue from software licenses royalties subscriptionbased services software services postcontract customer support “pcs” or “maintenance” hardware and appraisal services revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services we determine revenue recognition through the following steps 

 most of our software arrangements with customers contain multiple performance obligations that range from software licenses installation training and consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs services hosting and pcs for these contracts we account for individual performance obligations separately when they are distinct we evaluate whether separate performance obligations can be distinct or should be accounted for as one performance obligation arrangements that include software services such as training or installation are evaluated to determine whether the customer can benefit from the services either on their own or together with other resources readily available to the customer and whether the services are separately identifiable from other promises in the contract many of our software arrangements involve “offtheshelf” software we recognize the revenue allocable to offtheshelf software licenses and specified upgrades at a point in time when control of the software license transfers to the customer unless the software is not considered distinct we consider offtheshelf software to be distinct when it can be added to an arrangement with minor changes in the underlying code it can be used by the customer for the customer’s purpose upon installation and remaining services such as training are not considered highly interdependent or highly interrelated to the products functionality 

for arrangements that involve significant production modification or customization of the software or where software services are otherwise not considered distinct we recognize revenue over time by measuring progresstocompletion we measure progresstocompletion primarily using labor hours incurred as it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts these arrangements are often implemented over an extended period and occasionally require us to revise total cost estimates amounts recognized in revenue are calculated using the progresstocompletion measurement after giving effect to any changes in our cost estimates changes to total estimated contract costs if any are recorded in the period they are determined estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which we first determine that a loss is apparent when software services are distinct the fee allocable to the service element is recognized over the time we perform the services and is billed on a time and material or milestones basis 

subscriptionbased services consist of revenues derived from saas arrangements which primarily utilize the tyler private cloud and electronic filing transactions revenue from subscriptionbased services is generally recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer for saas arrangements we evaluate whether the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and whether the customer can feasibly maintain the software on the customer’s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a thirdparty to host the software we allocate contract value to each performance obligation of the arrangement that qualifies for treatment as a distinct element based on estimated ssp we recognize saas arrangements ratably over the term of the arrangement which range from one to ten but are typically for a period of three to five years  for software services associated with certain saas arrangements we have concluded that the services are not distinct and we recognize the revenue ratably over the remaining contractual period once we have provided the customer access to the software we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 

the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative ssp basis we determine the ssp based on our overall pricing objectives taking into consideration market conditions and other factors including the value of our contracts the applications sold customer demographics and the number and types of users within our contracts we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services in instances where ssp is not directly observable such as when we do not sell the product or service separately we determine ssp using the expected costplus margin approach revenue is recognized net of allowances for sales adjustments and any taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities 

typically the structure of our arrangements does not give rise to variable consideration however in those instances whereby variable consideration exists we include in our estimates additional revenue for variable consideration when we believe we have an enforceable right the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable 

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized since most of our customers are domestic governmental entities we rarely incur a loss resulting from credit risk associated with the inability of a customer to make required payments events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts may require revision include but are not limited to deterioration of a customer’s financial condition failure to manage our customer’s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance we determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts historical experience and other currently available evidence 

in connection with certain of our contracts we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet date many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period we review unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue in addition we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue which represents billings in excess of revenue earned the majority of this liability consists of maintenance billings for which payments are made in advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the maintenance period generally one year we also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit and the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product have not been met on a periodic basis we review by customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains appropriate 

intangible assets and goodwill  our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge the cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value with the excess allocated to goodwill accordingly we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets including software customer related intangibles trade name leases and goodwill these intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives we currently have no intangible assets with indefinite lives other than goodwill 

we assess goodwill for impairment annually as of april 1st or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable we begin with the qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying value before applying the quantitative assessment described below when testing goodwill for impairment quantitatively we first compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is performed to measure the amount of potential impairment in the second step we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized the fair values calculated in our impairment tests are determined using discounted cash flow models involving several assumptions the assumptions that are used are based upon what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain we evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by comparing the total of the fair value of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed qualitatively during the second quarter of 2019  did not result in an impairment charge during 2019  we did not identify any triggering events that would require an update to our annual impairment review 

all intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of other intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows the assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved such indicators may include among others a significant decline in expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition and reductions in growth rates in addition products capabilities or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or noncompetitive any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets during 2019  we did not identify any triggering events that would indicate that the carrying amount of our intangible assets may not be recoverable 

sharebased compensation we have a stock incentive plan that provides for the grant of stock options restricted stock units and performance stock units to key employees directors and nonemployee consultants we estimate the fair value of sharebased awards on the date of grant sharebased compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures which will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from such estimates changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data 

we estimate stock price volatility at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock estimated option life is determined using the weightedaverage period the stock options are expected to be outstanding based primarily on the options’ vesting terms remaining contractual life and the employees’ expected exercise based on historical patterns determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates 

analysis of results of operations and other 

the following discussion compares the historical results of operations on a basis consistent with gaap for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  



2019 compared to 2018 

revenues 

on february 28 2019 we acquired all of the capital stock of micropact a leading provider of cots solutions including entellitrak® a lowcode application development platform for case management and business process management used extensively in the public sector the following table details revenue for micropact for the period presented as of december 31 2019  which is included in our consolidated statements of income from the date of acquisition 



on october 30 2019 we acquired certain assets of cht an industryleading provider of jury management systems that offers a fully integrated endtoend saas solution to manage all facets of juror management from source list generation to juror processing and payment on february 1 2019 we acquired all the assets of mycivic a company that provides software solutions to connect communities the impact of the cht and mycivic acquisitions on our operating results is not considered material individually and in the aggregate and is not included in the table above the results of the micropact cht and mycivic acquisitions are included with the operating results of the es segment from their dates of acquisition for comparative purposes we have provided explanations for changes in operations to exclude results of operations for these acquisitions noting the exclusion 

software licenses and royalties 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software licenses and royalties revenue for the years ended december 31 



excluding the impact of acquisitions software licenses and royalties revenue decreased 2 compared to prior year the decline was primarily due to a shift in the mix of new software contracts toward more subscription agreements compared to the prior year our total new contract value mix in 2019  was approximately 37 perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 63 subscriptionbased arrangements compared to total new contract value mix in 2018  of approximately 59 perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 41 subscriptionbased arrangements 

although the mix of new contracts between subscriptionbased and perpetual license arrangements may vary from quarter to quarter and year to year we expect our longerterm software license growth rate to be negatively impacted by a growing number of customers choosing our subscriptionbased options rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement subscriptionbased arrangements result in lower software license revenue in the initial year as compared to perpetual software license arrangements but generate higher overall revenue over the term of the contract 

subscriptions 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our subscriptions revenue for the years ended december 31 



subscriptionbased revenue primarily consists of revenue derived from our saas arrangements which generally utilize the tyler private cloud as part of our subscriptionbased services we also provide electronic document filing solutions “efiling” that simplify the filing and management of court related documents for courts and law offices efiling revenue is derived from transaction fees and fixed fee arrangements 

excluding the results of acquisitions subscriptionbased revenue increased 26 compared to 2018  new saas clients as well as existing clients who converted to our saas model provided the majority of the subscription revenue increase in 2019  we added 596 new saas clients and 78 existing clients elected to convert to our saas model also efiling services contributed approximately  70 million of the subscription revenue increase in 2019  the increase in efiling revenue is attributed to new efiling clients as well as increased volumes as the result of several existing clients mandating efiling 

software services 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software services revenue for the years ended december 31 



software services revenue primarily consists of professional services billed in connection with implementing our software converting client data training client personnel custom development activities and consulting new clients who purchase our proprietary software licenses or subscriptions generally also contract with us to provide for the related software services existing clients also periodically purchase additional training consulting and minor programming services excluding the results of acquisitions software services revenue grew 04 compared to the prior year period the slight increase is due to higher new contract volume and the addition of professional services staff to grow our capacity to deliver backlog excluding employees added with acquisitions our implementation and support staff has grown by 232 employees since december 31 2018  

maintenance 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our maintenance revenue for the years ended december 31 



we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and certain thirdparty software excluding the results of acquisitions maintenance revenue grew 4 compared to the prior year maintenance and support revenue increased mainly due to growth in our installed customer base from new software license sales as well as annual maintenance rate increases partially offset by clients converting from onpremises license arrangements to saas 

appraisal services 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our appraisal services revenue for the years ended december 31 



in 2019  appraisal services revenue increased 7 compared to the prior year primarily due to the addition of several new revaluation contracts started during the second quarter of 2019 the appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states 

cost of revenues and gross margins 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues for the years ended december 31 



the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the years ended december 31 



software licenses royalties and acquired software  cost of software licenses royalties and acquired software is primarily comprised of amortization expense for acquired software and thirdparty software costs we do not have any direct costs associated with royalties the gross margin decrease of 58 is due to an increase in amortization expense for acquired software resulting from acquisitions completed in the last half of 2018 and in 2019 

software services maintenance and subscriptions  cost of software services maintenance and subscriptions primarily consists of personnel costs related to installation of our software conversion of client data training client personnel and support activities and various other services such as custom client development and ongoing operation of saas and efiling arrangements in 2019  the software services maintenance and subscriptions gross margin increased 17 compared to the prior year excluding employees added through acquisitions our implementation and support staff has grown by 232 employees since december 31 2018 as we accelerated hiring to ensure that we are wellpositioned to deliver our current backlog and anticipated new business costs related to maintenance and various other services such as saas and efiling typically grow at a slower rate than related revenue due to leverage in the utilization of support and maintenance staff and economies of scale 

appraisal services  appraisal services revenue comprised approximately 22 of total revenue the appraisal services gross margin increased 02 compared to 2018 due to ramp up of several new revaluation projects during second quarter 2019 

our 2019 blended gross margin slightly increased 06 compared to 2018  our overall gross margin increase is attributed to a higher revenue mix for subscription revenues compared to the prior year period resulting in an increase in incremental margin related to software services maintenance and subscriptions costs related to maintenance and various other services such as saas and efiling typically grow at a slower rate than related revenue due to leverage in the utilization of support and maintenance staff and economies of scale the increase in overall margins are partially offset by lower margins from software licenses in part due to lower software license revenue and higher amortization expense for acquired software resulting from acquisitions 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses consist primarily of salaries employee benefits travel sharebased compensation expense commissions and related overhead costs for administrative and sales and marketing employees as well as professional fees trade show activities advertising costs and other marketing related costs the following table sets forth a comparison of our sga expenses for the years ended december 31 



sga as a percentage of revenue was 237 in 2019 compared to 222 in 2018  sga expense increased approximately 24 compared to the prior year period in 2019 our operating results include 199 million of sga expenses for micropact from the date of acquisition the remaining sga expense increase is mainly due to compensation cost related to increased staff levels higher stock compensation expense and increased commission expense as a result of higher sales excluding employees added with acquisitions we added 81 employees mainly to our sales and finance teams since december 31 2018  in addition our 2019 stock compensation expense rose 58 million  mainly due to increases in our stock price over recent years 

research and development expense 

research and development expense consists primarily of salaries employee benefits and related overhead costs associated with new product development the following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the years ended december 31 



research and development expense increased 29 in 2019 compared to the prior year period mainly due to a number of new tyler product development initiatives across our product suites including increased investments in research and development at recently acquired businesses to support these initiatives our research and development staff has grown by 153 since december 31 2018  

amortization of customer and trade name intangibles 

acquisition intangibles are comprised of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that is allocated to acquired software leases and customer and trade name intangibles the remaining excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues while amortization expense of customer and trade name intangibles is recorded as operating expense the estimated useful lives of both customer and trade name intangibles range from five to 25 years the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the years ended december 31 



amortization of customer and trade name intangibles increased due to the impact of intangibles added with several acquisitions completed in 2018 and 2019  

estimated annual amortization expense relating to customer and trade name acquisition intangibles excluding acquired software for which the amortization expense is recorded as cost of revenues for the next five years and thereafter is as follows in thousands 



amortization expense relating to acquired leases will be recorded as a reduction to hardware and other revenue and is expected to be 525000 in 2020  525000 in 2021  525000 in 2022  525000 in 2023  525000 in 2024 and 512000 thereafter  

other 

the following table sets forth a comparison of other income net for the years ended december 31 



other income is comprised of interest income from invested cash net of interest expense and nonusage and other fees associated with our revolving credit agreement other income net increased compared to the prior period due to increased interest income from higher levels of cash and investments resulting from cash generated in the current year offset by increased interest expense from new debt outstanding during the current year under our credit agreement 

income tax provision 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the years ended december 31 



the increase in the income tax provision and the effective income tax rate in 2019 compared to the prior year is primarily due to lower excess tax benefits from stock option exercises in 2019 stock option exercise activity in 2019 generated excess tax benefits of 298 million  while stock option exercise activity in 2018 generated 325 million excess tax benefits in addition the 2018 income tax provision contains a tax benefit of 18 million resulting from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the enactment of the 2017 tax act which reduced the statutory us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 excluding the impact of the excess tax benefits and the tax act our income tax provision and effective tax rate in 2019 would have been 431 million and 270 and in 2018  would have been 426 million and 274  respectively 

the effective income tax rates in both 2019 and 2018 differed from the united states federal statutory corporate income tax rate of 21 due to state income taxes the research tax credit nondeductible sharebased compensation expense disqualifying incentive stock option dispositions and other nondeductible business expenses 

2018 compared to 2017 

revenues 

software licenses and royalties 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software licenses and royalties revenue for the years ended december 31 



software license and royalties revenue increased 8 compared to the prior year the majority of this growth was due to an active marketplace as the result of generally positive local government economic conditions as well as our increasingly strong competitive position which we attribute in part to our investment in product development in recent years an increase in the number of larger contracts related to our planning regulatory and maintenance solutions and public safety solutions also contributed to the growth in license revenue 

although the mix of new contracts between subscriptionbased and perpetual license arrangements may vary from quarter to quarter and year to year we expect our longerterm software license growth rate to be negatively impacted by a growing number of customers choosing our subscriptionbased options rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement subscriptionbased arrangements result in lower software license revenue in the initial year as compared to perpetual software license arrangements but generate higher overall revenue over the term of the contract our new client mix in 2018 was approximately 47 selecting perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 53 selecting subscriptionbased arrangements compared to a client mix in 2017 of approximately 53 selecting perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 47 selecting subscriptionbased arrangements 

subscriptions 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our subscriptions revenue for the years ended december 31 



subscriptionbased revenue primarily consists of revenue derived from our saas arrangements which generally utilize the tyler private cloud as part of our subscriptionbased services we also provide electronic document filing solutions “efiling” that simplify the filing and management of court related documents for courts and law offices efiling revenue is derived from transaction fees and fixed fee arrangements excluding the results of acquisitions subscriptionbased revenue increased 21 compared to 2017 

new saas clients as well as existing clients who converted to our saas model provided the majority of the subscription revenue increase in 2018 we added 410 new saas clients and 97 existing clients elected to convert to our saas model also efiling services contributed approximately 62 million of the subscription revenue increase in 2018 the increase in efiling revenue is attributed to new efiling clients as well as increased volumes as the result of several existing clients mandating efiling the acquisition of socrata which primarily has a subscription revenue model also contributed to the increase in subscription revenues 

software services 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software services revenue for the years ended december 31 



software services revenue primarily consists of professional services billed in connection with implementing our software converting client data training client personnel custom development activities and consulting new clients who purchase our proprietary software licenses generally also contract with us to provide for the related software services existing clients also periodically purchase additional training consulting and minor programming services excluding the results of acquisitions software services revenue grew 3 compared to the prior year period this growth is due to a higher level of new software sales through both our license and subscription models 

maintenance 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our maintenance revenue for the years ended december 31 



we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and certain thirdparty software maintenance revenue grew 7 compared to the prior year maintenance and support revenue increased mainly due to growth in our installed customer base from new software license sales as well as annual maintenance rate increases 

appraisal services 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our appraisal services revenue for the years ended december 31 



in 2018 appraisal services revenue decreased 13 compared to the prior year primarily due to the successful completion of several large revaluation projects in mid2017 the appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states 

cost of revenues and gross margins 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues for the years ended december 31 



the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the years ended december 31 



software licenses royalties and acquired software  cost of software licenses royalties and acquired software is primarily comprised of amortization expense for acquired software and thirdparty software costs we do not have any direct costs associated with royalties the gross margin increase of 03 is due to higher software license revenues offset by an increase in amortization expense for acquired software attributed to new acquisitions completed in 2018 

software services maintenance and subscriptions  cost of software services maintenance and subscriptions primarily consists of personnel costs related to installation of our software conversion of client data training client personnel and support activities and various other services such as custom client development and ongoing operation of saas and efiling arrangements in 2018 the software services maintenance and subscriptions gross margin decreased 07 compared to the prior year excluding employees added through acquisitions our implementation and support staff grew by 57 employees in 2018 as we accelerated hiring to ensure that we are wellpositioned to deliver our current backlog and anticipated new business recognition of acquisitionrelated deferred revenue associated with subscriptions and maintenance also resulted in lower gross margins 

appraisal services  appraisal services revenue comprised approximately 23 of total revenue the appraisal services gross margin decreased 04 compared to 2017 due to the reduction in higher margin projects substantially complete by early 2017 and lower volume of revenues in the current period to cover relatively fixed costs 

our 2018 blended gross margin slightly decreased by 05 compared to 2017 our overall gross margin decrease is mainly attributed to additions to our implementation staff and lower margin revenues from appraisal services offset by improved margin on revenues from software licenses 

selling general and administrative expenses 

the following table sets forth a comparison of selling general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31 

sga as a percentage of revenue was 222 in 2018 compared to 209 in 2017 sga expense increased approximately 18 compared to the prior year period in 2018 our operating results include 91 million of sga expenses for socrata from the date of acquisition the remaining sga expense increase is mainly due to compensation cost related to increased staff levels higher stock compensation expense and increased commission expense as a result of higher sales excluding 

employees added with acquisitions we added 47 employees mainly to our sales and finance teams since in 2018 in addition our 2018 stock compensation expense rose 112 million mainly due to increases in our stock price over the last few years 

research and development expense 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the years ended december 31 



research and development expense increased 34 in 2018 compared to the prior year period mainly due to a number of new tyler product development initiatives across our product suites including increased investments in research and development at recently acquired businesses to support these initiatives our research and development staff grew by 159 in 2018 

amortization of customer and trade name intangibles 

the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the years ended december 31 



amortization of customer and trade name intangibles increased due to the impact of intangibles added with several acquisitions completed in 2017 and 2018 

other 

the following table sets forth a comparison of other income net for the years ended december 31 



other income is comprised of interest income from invested cash net of interest expense and nonusage and other fees associated with our revolving credit agreement other income net increased compared to the prior period due to increased interest income from significantly higher levels of cash and investments resulting from cash generated in the last year we had no debt in 2018 as we repaid all borrowings under the revolving line of credit in january 2017 

income tax provision benefit 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the years ended december 31 



the increase in the income tax provision in 2018 is primarily due to the onetime tax benefit of 260 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the enactment of the tax act which reduced the statutory us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 the increase is somewhat offset by the decrease in statutory us federal corporate income tax rate for 2018 in addition excess tax benefits from stock option exercises were lower in 2018 as compared to the prior period stock option exercise activity in 2018 generated excess tax benefits of 325 million while stock option exercise activity in 2017 generated 406 million excess tax benefits 

the increase in the effective income tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 is also primarily attributable to the onetime tax benefit associated with the tax act recognized in 2017 and the decrease in excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises realized offset by the decrease in statutory us federal corporate income tax rate for 2018 excluding the impact of the tax act and the excess tax benefits our income tax provision and effective tax rate in 2018 would have been 426 million and 274 and in 2017 would have been 605 million and 370 respectively 

the effective income tax rates in both 2018 and 2017 differed from the statutory united states federal corporate income tax rate of 21 and 35 respectively due to state income taxes the research tax credit nondeductible sharebased compensation expense disqualifying incentive stock option dispositions and other nondeductible business expenses and in 2017 the domestic production activities deduction 

financial condition and liquidity 

as of december 31 2019  we had cash and cash equivalents of 2327 million compared to 1343 million at december 31 2018  we also had 816 million invested in investment grade corporate bonds municipal bonds and assetbacked securities as of december 31 2019 compared to 977 million at december 31 2018  these investments mature between 2020 through 2023 and we intend to hold these investments until maturity cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with several domestic banks and money market funds as of december 31 2019  we had no outstanding borrowings and no outstanding letters of credit we believe our revolving line of credit cash from operating activities cash on hand and access to the credit markets provide us with sufficient flexibility to meet our longterm financial needs 

the following table sets forth a summary of cash flows for the years ended december 31 



net cash provided by operating activities continues to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures other potential capital resources include cash on hand public and private issuances of debt or equity securities and bank borrowings it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets in the future may be limited by economic conditions or other factors we currently believe that cash provided by operating activities cash on hand and available credit are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures income tax obligations and share repurchases for at least the next twelve months 

in 2019  operating activities provided cash of 2547 million compared to 2502 million in 2018  operating activities that provided cash were primarily comprised of net income of 1465 million  noncash depreciation and amortization charges of 767 million and noncash sharebased compensation expense of 600 million  working capital excluding cash increased approximately 355 million due to higher accounts receivable resulting from an increase in unbilled receivables attributed to revenues recognized prior to billings higher accounts receivable related to annual maintenance and subscription billings timing of income tax payments and the deferred taxes associated with stock option activity during the period these increases were offset by the growth in deferred revenue balances and timing of payments of payroll related taxes and vendor invoices 

in general changes in the balance of deferred revenue are cyclical and primarily driven by the timing of our maintenance and subscription billings our renewal dates occur throughout the year but our largest maintenance renewal cycles occur in the second and fourth quarters 

days sales outstanding in accounts receivable were 117 days at december 31 2019  compared to 111 days at december 31 2018  the increase in our dso is mainly due to an increase in unbilled receivables attributed to the increase in software license revenue for which we have recognized revenue at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer but the billing has not yet been submitted to the customer an increase in software services contracts accounted for using progresstocompletion method of revenue recognition in which the services are performed in one accounting period but the billing normally occurs subsequently in another accounting period also contributed to the increase in dso furthermore our maintenance billing cycle typically peaks at its highest level in june and second highest level in december of each year and is followed by collections in the subsequent quarter dso is calculated based on quarterend accounts receivable excluding longterm receivables but including unbilled receivables divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by 360 days

tyler was founded in 1966 prior to 1998 we operated as a diversified industrial conglomerate with operations in various industrial retail and distribution businesses all of which have been divested in 1997 we embarked on a multiphase growth plan focused on serving the specialized information management needs of local governments nationwide we entered the local government it market through a series of strategic acquisitions in 1998 and 1999 

market overview 

the state and local government market is one of the largest and most decentralized it markets in the country consisting of all 50 states approximately 3000 counties 36000 cities and towns and 13900 school districts this market is also comprised of approximately 37000 special districts and other agencies each with specialized delegated responsibilities and unique information management requirements 

traditionally local government bodies and agencies performed statemandated duties including property assessment record keeping road maintenance law enforcement administration of election and judicial functions and the provision of welfare assistance today a host of emerging and urgent issues are confronting local governments each of which demands a service response these areas include criminal justice and corrections administration and finance public safety health and human services planning regulatory and maintenance and records and document management transfers of responsibility from the federal and state governments to county and municipal governments and agencies in these and other areas also place additional service and financial requirements on these local government units in addition constituents of local governments are increasingly demanding improved service and better access to information from public entities as a result local governments recognize the increasing value of information management systems and services to among other things improve revenue collection provide increased access to information and streamline delivery of services to their constituents local government bodies are now recognizing that “egovernment” is an additional responsibility for community development from integrated tax systems to integrated civil and criminal justice information systems many counties and cities have benefited significantly from the implementation of jurisdictionwide systems that allow different agencies or government offices to share data and provide a more comprehensive approach to information management many city and county governmental agencies also have unique individual information management requirements which must be tailored to the specific functions of each particular office 

many local governments also have difficulties attracting and retaining the staff necessary to support their it functions as a result they seek to establish longterm relationships with reliable providers of high quality it products and services such as tyler 

although local governments often face budgetary constraints in their operations their primary revenue sources are usually property taxes and to a lesser extent utility billings and other fees which historically tend to be relatively stable in addition the acquisition of new technology typically enables local governments to operate more efficiently and often provides a measurable return on investment that justifies the purchase of software and related services 

gartner inc a leading information technology research and advisory company estimates that state and local government application and vertical specific software spending will grow from 161 billion in 2019 to 196 billion in 2022 the professional services and support segments of the market are expected to expand from 316 billion in 2019 to 352 billion in 2022 application and vertical specific software sales in the primary and secondary education segments of the market is expected to expand from 28 billion in 2019 to 36 billion in 2022 while professional services and support are expected to grow from 19 billion in 2019 to 22 billion in 2022

strategy 

our objective is to grow our revenue and earnings organically supplemented by focused strategic acquisitions the key components of our business strategy are to

• expand our existing client relationships  our existing customer base offers significant opportunities for additional sales of solutions and services that we currently offer but that existing clients do not fully utilize addon sales to existing clients typically involve lower sales and marketing expenses than sales to new clients 

• grow recurring revenues  we have a large recurring revenue base from maintenance and support and subscriptionbased services which generated revenues of 6051 million  or 65  of total revenues in 2018  we have historically experienced very low customer turnover approximately 2  annually and recurring revenues continue to grow as the installed customer base increases subscriptionbased revenues have been our fastest growing revenue category over the past five years increasing from 878 million  in 2014  to 2205 million  in 2018  

• maximize economies of scale and take advantage of financial leverage in our business  we seek to build and maintain a larger client base to create economies of scale enabling us to provide valueadded products and services to our clients while expanding our operating margins because we sell primarily “offtheshelf” software increased sales of the same solutions result in incrementally higher gross margins in addition we believe that we have a marketing and administrative infrastructure in place that can be leveraged to accommodate significant longterm growth without proportionately increasing selling general and administrative expenses 

• attract and retain highly qualified employees  we believe that the depth and quality of our management and staff is one of our significant strengths and that the ability to retain such employees is crucial to our continued growth and success we believe that our stable management team financial strength and growth opportunities as well as our leadership position in the local government market enhance our attractiveness as an employer for highly skilled employees 

• pursue selected strategic acquisitions  while we expect to primarily grow internally from time to time we selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that provide us with one or more of the following 

 sales marketing and clients 

we market our products and services through direct sales and marketing personnel located throughout the united states other inhouse sales staff focus on addon sales professional services and support 

sales of new systems are typically generated from referrals from other government offices or departments within a county or municipality referrals from other local governments relationships established between sales representatives and county or local officials contacts at trade shows direct mailings and direct contact from prospects already familiar with us we are active in numerous national state county and local government associations and participate in annual meetings trade shows and educational events 

clients consist primarily of federal county and municipal agencies school districts and other government offices in counties clients include the auditor treasurer tax assessorcollector county clerk district clerk county and district court judges probation officers sheriff and county appraiser at municipal government sites clients include directors from various departments including administration finance utilities public works code enforcement personnel purchasing taxation municipal court and police contracts for software products and services are generally implemented over periods of three months to one year although some complex implementations may span multiple years with annually renewing maintenance and support update agreements thereafter although either the client or we can terminate these agreements historically almost all support and maintenance agreements are automatically renewed annually during 2018  approximately 41  of our revenue was attributable to ongoing support and maintenance agreements 

competition 

we compete with numerous local regional and national firms that provide or offer some or many of the same solutions and services that we provide many of these competitors are smaller companies that may be able to offer less expensive solutions than ours many of these firms operate within a specific geographic area andor in a narrow product or service niche we also compete with national firms some of which have greater financial and technical resources than we do including oracle corporation infor sap ag workday inc centralsquare technologies thomson reuters corporation and constellation software inc in addition we sometimes compete with consulting and systems integration firms which develop custom systems primarily for larger governments we also occasionally compete with central internal information service departments of local governments which requires us to persuade the enduser department to discontinue service by its own personnel and outsource the service to us 

we compete on a variety of factors including price service name recognition reputation technological capabilities and the ability to modify existing products and services to accommodate the individual requirements of the client our ability to offer an integrated system of applications for several offices or departments is often a competitive advantage local governmental units often are required to seek competitive proposals through a request for proposal process and some prospective clients use consultants to assist them with the proposal and vendor selection process 

suppliers 

substantially all of the computers peripherals printers scanners operating system software office automation software and other equipment necessary for the implementation and provision of our software systems and services are presently available from several thirdparty sources hardware is purchased on original equipment manufacturer or distributor terms at discounts from retail we have not experienced any significant supply problems 

backlog 

at december 31 2018  our revenue backlog was approximately 125 billion  compared to 123 billion  as adjusted at december 31 2017  the backlog represents signed contracts under which the revenue has not been recognized as of yearend approximately 6256 million  or 50  of the backlog is expected to be recognized during 2019  

intellectual property proprietary rights and licenses 

we regard certain features of our internal operations software and documentation as confidential and proprietary and rely on a combination of contractual restrictions trade secret laws and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property we generally do not rely on patents we believe that due to the rapid rate of technological change in the computer software industry trade secrets and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as knowledge ability and experience of our employees frequent product enhancements and timeliness and quality of support services we typically license our software products under nonexclusive license agreements which are generally nontransferable and have a perpetual term 

employees 

at december 31 2018  we had 4525  employees none of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to collective bargaining agreements we consider our relations with our employees to be positive 

internet website and availability of public filings 

we file annual quarterly current and other reports proxy statements and other information with the securities and exchange commission or sec pursuant to the securities exchange act you may read and copy any materials we file with the sec at the sec’s public reference room by calling the sec at 18007320330 the sec maintains an internet site that contains reports proxy and other information statements and other information regarding issuers including us that file electronically with the sec the address of this site is httpwwwsecgov

risk factors 

tableend an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk investors evaluating our company should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this annual report any of the following factors could materially harm our business operating results and financial condition additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business operating results and financial condition this section should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report we may make forwardlooking statements from time to time both written and oral we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forwardlooking statements our actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forwardlooking statements due to a number of factors including those set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report 

risks associated with our software products 

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities can disrupt our business and harm our competitive position 

threats to it security can take a variety of forms individuals and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations including statesponsored organizations may take steps that pose threats to our clients and our it they may develop and deploy malicious software to attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and data centers or act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks cyber threats are constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and clients breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications impair our ability to provide services to our clients and protect the privacy of their data result in product development delays compromise confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or otherwise adversely affect our business our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these evolving threats 

disclosure of personally identifiable information andor other sensitive client data could result in liability and harm our reputation 

we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable and other confidential information of our clients the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security despite our efforts to improve security controls it is possible our security controls over personal data our training of employees on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of client data that we store and manage disclosure of personally identifiable information andor other sensitive client data could result in liability and harm our reputation 

hosting services for some of our products are dependent upon the uninterrupted operation of data centers 

a material portion of our business is provided through software hosting services these hosting services depend on the uninterrupted operation of data centers and the ability to protect computer equipment and information stored in these data centers against damage that may be caused by natural disaster fire power loss telecommunications or internet failure acts of terrorism unauthorized intrusion computer viruses and other similar damaging events if any of our data centers were to become inoperable for an extended period we might be unable to fulfill our contractual commitments although we take what we believe to be reasonable precautions against such occurrences we can give no assurance that damaging events such as these will not result in a prolonged interruption of our services which could result in client dissatisfaction loss of revenue and damage to our business 

we run the risk of errors or defects with new products or enhancements to existing products 

our software products are complex and may contain errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released although we have not experienced material adverse effects from any such defects or errors to date we cannot assure you that material defects and errors will not be found in the future any such defects could result in a loss of revenues or delay market acceptance our license agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability however it is possible we may not always successfully negotiate such provisions in our client contracts or the limitation of liability provisions may not be effective due to existing or future federal state or local laws ordinances or judicial decisions although we maintain errors and omissions and general liability insurance and we try to structure contracts to limit liability we cannot assure you that a successful claim could not be made or would not have a material adverse effect on our future operating results 

we must timely respond to technological changes to be competitive 

the market for our products is characterized by technological change evolving industry standards in software technology changes in client requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments satisfy increasingly sophisticated client requirements and achieve market acceptance we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and costeffective manner the products capabilities or technologies developed by others could also render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to develop or acquire new software products or develop enhancements to existing products on a timely and costeffective basis or if such new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance 

we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights 

many of our product and service offerings incorporate proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of contracts copyrights and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology we cannot be certain that we have taken all appropriate steps to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property there has also recently been an apparent evolution in the legal standards and regulations courts and the us patent office may apply in favorably evaluating software patent rights we are not currently involved in any material intellectual property litigation however we may be a party to such litigation in the future to protect our proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights we cannot assure you that thirdparties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us with respect to current or future products any claims or litigation with or without merit could be timeconsuming costly and a diversion to management any such claims and litigation could also cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements such royalty or licensing arrangements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all therefore litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business regardless of the final outcome of such litigation 

clients may elect to terminate our maintenance contracts and manage operations internally 

it is possible that our clients may elect to not renew maintenance contracts for our software trying instead to maintain and operate the software themselves using their perpetual license rights excluding software applications that we provide on a hosted or cloud basis this could adversely affect our revenues and profits additionally they may inadvertently allow our intellectual property or other information to fall into the hands of thirdparties including our competitors which could adversely affect our business 

material portions of our business require the internet infrastructure to be further developed or adequately maintained 

part of our future success depends on the use of the internet as a means to access public information and perform transactions electronically including for example electronic filing of court documents this in part requires the further development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure among other things this further development and maintenance will require a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed data capacity security and timely development of complementary products for providing reliable internet access and services if this infrastructure fails to be further developed or be adequately maintained our business would be harmed because users may not be able to access our government portals 

risks associated with selling products and services into the public sector marketplace 

selling products and services into the public sector poses unique challenges 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of software and services to state county and city governments other municipal agencies and other public entities we expect that sales to public sector clients will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues in the future we face many risks and challenges associated with contracting with governmental entities including 

 each of these risks is outside our control if we fail to adequately adapt to these risks and uncertainties our financial performance could be adversely affected 

a prolonged economic slowdown could harm our operations 

a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce demand for our software products and services governments may face financial pressures that could in turn affect our growth rate and profitability in the future there is no assurance that government spending levels will be unaffected by declining or stagnant general economic conditions and if budget shortfalls occur they may negatively impact government it spending and could adversely affect our business 

the open bidding process creates uncertainty in predicting future contract awards 

many governmental agencies purchase products and services through an open bidding process generally a governmental entity will publish an established list of requirements requesting potential vendors to propose solutions for the established requirements to respond successfully to these requests for proposals we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract the time required to establish operations for the proposed client and the likely terms of any other thirdparty proposals submitted we cannot guarantee that we will win any bids in the future through the request for proposal process or that any winning bids will ultimately result in contracts on favorable terms our failure to secure contracts through the open bidding process or to secure such contracts on favorable terms may adversely affect our revenue and gross margins 

we face significant competition from other vendors and potential new entrants into our markets 

we believe we are a leading provider of integrated solutions for the public sector however we face competition from a variety of software vendors that offer products and services similar to those offered by us as well as from companies offering to develop custom software we compete based on a number of factors including 



 we believe our market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors that vary in size product platform and product scope our competitors include consulting firms publicly held companies that focus on selected segments of the public sector market and a significant number of smaller privately held companies certain competitors have greater technical marketing and financial resources than we do we cannot assure you that such competitors will not develop products or offer services that are superior to our products or services or that achieve greater market acceptance 

we also compete with internal centralized it departments of governmental entities which requires us to persuade the enduser to stop the internal service and outsource to us in addition our clients and prospective clients could elect to provide information management services internally through new or existing departments which could reduce the market for our services 

we could face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the public sector software application market and new products and technologies are introduced increased competition could result in pricing pressure fewer client orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with thirdparties thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective clients it is possible that new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect upon our business 

fixedprice contracts may affect our profits 

some of our contracts are structured on a fixedprice basis which can lead to various risks including 

 if we do not adequately assess and manage these and other risks we may be subject to cost overruns and penalties which may harm our financial performance 

changes in the insurance markets may affect our business 

some of our clients primarily those for our property appraisal services require that we secure performance bonds before they will select us as their vendor in addition we have in the past been required to provide letters of credit as security for the issuance of a performance bond we cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure such performance bonds in the future on terms that are favorable to us if at all our inability to obtain performance bonds on favorable terms or at all could impact our future ability to win some contract awards particularly large property appraisal services contracts which could negatively impact revenues in addition the general insurance markets may experience volatility which may lead to future increases in our general and administrative expenses and negatively impact our operating results 

risks associated with our periodic results and stock price 

fluctuations in quarterly revenue could adversely impact our operating results and stock price 

our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter for a variety of reasons including 

 in each fiscal quarter our expense levels operating costs and hiring plans are based to some extent on projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed if our actual revenues fall below expectations we could experience a reduction in operating results also if actual revenues or earnings for any given quarter fall below expectations it may lead to a decline in our stock price 

increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins 

we realize lower margins on software and appraisal service revenues than on license revenue the majority of our contracts include both software licenses and software services therefore an increase in the percentage of software service and appraisal service revenue compared to license revenue could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and could adversely affect operating results 

our stock price may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile examples of factors that may significantly impact our stock price include 



in addition the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of technology company stocks and may in the future adversely affect the market price of our stock sometimes securities class action litigation is filed following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities we cannot assure you that similar litigation will not occur in the future with respect to us such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect upon our financial performance 

our financial outlook may not be realized 

from time to time in press releases and otherwise we may publish forecasts or other forwardlooking statements regarding our results including estimated revenues or earnings any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties and as a matter of course any number of them may prove to be incorrect further the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors including those described in this discussion many of which are beyond our control as a result we cannot be certain that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse current and potential stockholders are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions but instead are encouraged to utilize our entire publicly available mix of historical and forwardlooking information as well as other available information regarding us our products and services and the software industry when evaluating our prospective results of operations 

risks associated with our growth strategy and other general corporate risks 

we may experience difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy 

a material portion of our historical growth has resulted from strategic acquisitions although our focus is on internal growth we will continue to identify and pursue strategic acquisitions with suitable candidates these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including risks that a transaction does not advance our business strategy that we do not achieve the expected return on our investment that we have difficulty integrating business systems and technology that we have difficulty retaining or integrating new employees that the transactions distract management from our other businesses that we acquire unforeseen liabilities and other unanticipated events our future success will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate future acquisitions into our operations it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits of these transactions such as increased revenue enhanced efficiencies or increased market share or the benefits may be ultimately less than we expected although we conduct due diligence reviews of potential acquisition candidates we may not identify all material liabilities or risks related to acquisition candidates there can be no assurance that any such strategic acquisitions will be accomplished on favorable terms or will result in profitable operations 

our failure to properly manage growth could adversely affect our business 

we have expanded our operations significantly since 1998 when we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector we intend to continue expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities this growth places significant demands on management and operational resources in order to manage growth effectively we must implement and improve our operational systems procedures and controls on a timely basis if we fail to implement these systems our business may be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to hire integrate and retain qualified personnel 

our continued success will depend upon the availability and performance of our key management sales marketing client support and product development personnel the loss of key management or technical personnel could adversely affect us we believe that our continued success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract integrate and retain such personnel we have at times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel competition for qualified software development sales and other personnel is intense and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance may result in additional expenses 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure can create uncertainty for public companies the costs required to comply with such evolving laws are difficult to predict to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards this investment may result in an unforeseen increase in general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenuegenerating activities which may harm our operating results 

we don’t foresee paying dividends on our common stock 

we have not declared nor paid a cash dividend since we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector in 1998 we intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law could deter takeover attempts 

our board of directors may issue up to 1000000 shares of preferred stock and may determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting and conversion rights of these preferred shares these determinations may be made without any further vote or action by our stockholders the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock in addition some provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and the delaware general corporation law could also delay prevent or make more difficult a merger tender offer or proxy contest involving us

revenues – we derive our revenues from five primary sources sale of software licenses and royalties subscriptionbased arrangements software services maintenance and appraisal services subscriptions and maintenance are considered recurring revenue sources and comprised approximately 65  of our revenue in 2018  the number of new saas clients and the number of existing clients who convert from our traditional software arrangements to our saas model are a significant driver to our business together with new software license sales and maintenance rate increases in addition we also monitor our customer base and churn as we historically have experienced very low customer turnover during 2018  based on our number of customers turnover was approximately 2  

cost of revenues and gross margins – our primary cost component is personnel expenses in connection with providing software implementation subscriptionbased services maintenance and support and appraisal services to our clients we can improve gross margins by controlling headcount and related costs and by expanding our revenue base especially from those products and services that produce incremental revenue with minimal incremental cost such as software licenses and royalties subscriptionbased services and maintenance and support our appraisal projects are cyclical in nature and we often employ appraisal personnel on a shortterm basis to coincide with the life of a project as of december 31 2018  our total employee count increased to 4525  from 4069  at december 31 2017  

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses – the primary components of sga expenses are administrative and sales personnel salaries and commissions sharebased compensation expense marketing expense rent and professional fees sales commissions typically fluctuate with revenues and sharebased compensation expense generally increases as the market price of our stock increases other administrative expenses tend to grow at a slower rate than revenues 

liquidity and cash flows – the primary driver of our cash flows is net income uses of cash include acquisitions capital investments in property and equipment and discretionary purchases of treasury stock our working capital needs are fairly stable throughout the year with the significant components of cash outflows being payment of personnel expenses offset by cash inflows representing collection of accounts receivable and cash receipts from clients in advance of revenue being earned in recent years we have also received significant amounts of cash from employees exercising stock options and contributing to our employee stock purchase plan 

balance sheet – cash accounts receivable and days sales outstanding and deferred revenue balances are important indicators of our business 

adoption of new revenue accounting standard 

on january 1 2018 we adopted asu no 201409 using the full retrospective method of transition which requires that the new standard be applied to all periods presented the impacts of adoption are reflected in the financial information herein for additional details see note 1  summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements in this report 

recent accounting guidance not yet adopted 

leases on february 25 2016 the fasb issued its new lease accounting guidance in asu no 201602 leases  topic 842 under the new guidance lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases with the exception of shortterm leases at the commencement date 

 topic 842 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2018 including interim periods therein early application is permitted for all business entities upon issuance upon adoption entities will be required to use a modified retrospective approach with an option to use certain practical expedients we expect to adopt asu 201602 when effective using the transition method that allows us to initially apply the guidance at the adoption date of january 1 2019 and recognize a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption we expect to use the package of practical expedients that allows us to not reassess 1 lease classification for any expired or existing leases and 2 initial direct costs for any expired or existing leases we expect asu 201602 will impact our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures we are currently evaluating the extent of the impact and expect that most of our lease commitments will be subject to the updated guidance and recognized as lease liabilities and rightofuse assets on our consolidated balance sheets upon adoption based on our current portfolio of leases we estimate a range of 155 million  to 178 million  of lease assets and liabilities to be recognized on our balance sheet primarily relating to office facilities 

outlook 

the local government software market continues to be active and our backlog at december 31 2018  reached 125 billion  a 2  increase from last year we expect to continue to achieve solid growth in revenue and earnings with our strong financial position and cash flow we plan to continue to make significant investments in product development to better position us to continue to expand our competitive position in the public sector software market over the long term 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements the reported amounts of revenues cost of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosure of contingencies the notes to the financial statements included as part of this annual report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the application of the progress toward completion methods of revenue recognition estimated standalone selling price ssp for distinct performance obligations the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of intangible assets determination of sharebased compensation expense and valuation allowance for receivables we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition we earn revenue from software licenses royalties subscriptionbased services software services postcontract customer support “pcs” or “maintenance” hardware and appraisal services revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services we determine revenue recognition through the following steps 

 most of our software arrangements with customers contain multiple performance obligations that range from software licenses installation training and consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs services hosting and pcs for these contracts we account for individual performance obligations separately when they are distinct we evaluate whether separate performance obligations can be distinct or should be accounted for as one performance obligation arrangements that include software services such as training or installation are evaluated to determine whether those services are highly interdependent or highly interrelated to the product’s functionality many of our software arrangements involve “offtheshelf” software we recognize the revenue allocable to offtheshelf software licenses and specified upgrades at a point in time when control of the software license transfers to the customer unless the software is not considered distinct we consider offtheshelf software to be distinct when it can be added to an arrangement with minor changes in the underlying code it can be used by the customer for the customer’s purpose upon installation and remaining services such as training are not considered highly interdependent or highly interrelated to the products functionality 

for arrangements that involve significant production modification or customization of the software or where software services are otherwise not considered distinct we recognize revenue over time by measuring progresstocompletion we measure progresstocompletion primarily using labor hours incurred as it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts these arrangements are often implemented over an extended period and occasionally require us to revise total cost estimates amounts recognized in revenue are calculated using the progresstocompletion measurement after giving effect to any changes in our cost estimates changes to total estimated contract costs if any are recorded in the period they are determined estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which we first determine that a loss is apparent when software services are distinct the fee allocable to the service element is recognized over the time we perform the services and is billed on a time and material basis 

subscriptionbased services consist of revenues derived from saas arrangements which primarily utilize the tyler private cloud and electronic filing transactions revenue from subscriptionbased services is generally recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer for saas arrangements we evaluate whether the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and whether the customer can feasibly maintain the software on the customer’s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a thirdparty to host the software we allocate contract value to each performance obligation of the arrangement that qualifies for treatment as a distinct element based on estimated ssp when it is determined that software is distinct and the customer has the ability to take control of the software we recognize revenue allocable to the software license fee when access to the software license is made available to the customer we recognize hosting services ratably over the term of the arrangement which range from one  to ten  years but are typically for a period of three  to five  years for software services associated with certain saas arrangements we have concluded that the services are not distinct and we recognize the revenue ratably over the remaining contractual period once we have provided the customer access to the software we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 

the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative ssp basis we determine the ssp based on our overall pricing objectives taking into consideration market conditions and other factors including the value of our contracts the applications sold customer demographics and the number and types of users within our contracts   we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services in instances where ssp is not directly observable such as when we do not sell the product or service separately we determine ssp using the expected costplus margin approach revenue is recognized net of allowances for sales adjustments and any taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities 

typically the structure of our arrangements does not give rise to variable consideration however in those instances whereby variable consideration exists we include in our estimates additional revenue for variable consideration when we believe we have an enforceable right the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable 

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized since most of our customers are domestic governmental entities we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts may require revision include but are not limited to deterioration of a customer’s financial condition failure to manage our customer’s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance we determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts historical experience and other currently available evidence 

in connection with certain of our contracts we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet date many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period we review unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue in addition we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue which represents billings in excess of revenue earned the majority of this liability consists of maintenance billings for which payments are made in advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the maintenance period generally one year we also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit and the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product have not been met on a periodic basis we review by customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains appropriate 

intangible assets and goodwill  our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge the cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value with the excess allocated to goodwill accordingly we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets including software customer related intangibles trade name leases and goodwill these intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives we currently have no intangible assets with indefinite lives other than goodwill 

when testing goodwill for impairment quantitatively we first compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is performed to measure the amount of potential impairment in the second step we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized the fair values calculated in our impairment tests are determined using discounted cash flow models involving several assumptions the assumptions that are used are based upon what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain we evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by comparing the total of the fair value of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed quantitatively during the second quarter of 2018  did not result in an impairment charge during 2018  we did not identify any triggering events that would require an update to our annual impairment review 

all intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of other intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows the assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved such indicators may include among others a significant decline in expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition and reductions in growth rates in addition products capabilities or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or noncompetitive any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets 

sharebased compensation we have a stock incentive plan that provides for the grant of stock options restricted stock units and performance stock units to key employees directors and nonemployee consultants we estimate the fair value of sharebased awards on the date of grant sharebased compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures which will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from such estimates changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data 

we estimate stock price volatility at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock estimated option life is determined using the weightedaverage period the stock options are expected to be outstanding based primarily on the options’ vesting terms remaining contractual life and the employees’ expected exercise based on historical patterns determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates 

analysis of results of operations and other 

the following discussion compares the historical results of operations on a basis consistent with gaap for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  



2018  compared to 2017   

revenues 

on april 30 2018 we acquired socrata a company that provides open data and dataasaservice solutions for federal state and local government agencies including cloudbased data integration visualization analysis and reporting solutions the following table details revenue for socrata for the periods presented as of december 31 2018  which is included in our consolidated statements of income 



on december 7 2018 we acquired scenedoc inc a company that provides mobilefirst softwareasaservice saas field reporting for law enforcement agencies on october 1 2018 we acquired mobileeyes a company that develops software to improve public safety by supporting fire prevention and suppression emergency response and structural safety on august 31 2018 we acquired caseloadpro a company that provides a fully featured probation case management system on april 30 2018 we also acquired sage a cybersecurity company offering a suite of services that supports an entire cybersecurity lifecycle the impact of these acquisitions on our operating results is not considered material individually and in the aggregate and is not included in the table above the results of these acquisitions are included with the operating results of the es segment from their dates of acquisition for comparative purposes we have provided explanations for changes in operations to exclude results of operations for these acquisitions noting the exclusion 

software licenses and royalties 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software licenses and royalties revenue for the years ended december 31 



software license and royalties revenue grew 8  compared to the prior year the majority of this growth was due to an active marketplace as the result of generally positive local government economic conditions as well as our increasingly strong competitive position which we attribute in part to our investment in product development in recent years an increase in the number of larger contracts related to our planning regulatory and maintenance solutions and public safety solutions also contributed to the growth in license revenue 

although the mix of new contracts between subscriptionbased and perpetual license arrangements may vary from quarter to quarter and year to year we expect our longerterm software license growth rate to be negatively impacted by a growing number of customers choosing our subscriptionbased options rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement subscriptionbased arrangements result in lower software license revenue in the initial year as compared to perpetual software license arrangements but generate higher overall revenue over the term of the contract our new client mix in 2018  was approximately 47  selecting perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 53  selecting subscriptionbased arrangements compared to a client mix in 2017  of approximately 53  selecting perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 47  selecting subscriptionbased arrangements 

subscriptions 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our subscriptions revenue for the years ended december 31 



subscriptionbased revenue primarily consists of revenue derived from our saas arrangements which generally utilize the tyler private cloud as part of our subscriptionbased services we also provide electronic document filing solutions “efiling” that simplify the filing and management of court related documents for courts and law offices efiling revenue is derived from transaction fees and fixed fee arrangements 

excluding the results of acquisitions subscriptionbased revenue increased 21  compared to 2017  new saas clients as well as existing clients who converted to our saas model provided the majority of the subscription revenue increase in 2018  we added 410  new saas clients and 97  existing clients elected to convert to our saas model also efiling services contributed approximately  62 million  of the subscription revenue increase in 2018  the increase in efiling revenue is attributed to new efiling clients as well as increased volumes as the result of several existing clients mandating efiling the acquisition of socrata which primarily has a subscription revenue model also contributed to the increase in subscription revenues 

software services 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software services revenue for the years ended december 31 



software services revenue primarily consists of professional services billed in connection with implementing our software converting client data training client personnel custom development activities and consulting new clients who purchase our proprietary software licenses generally also contract with us to provide for the related software services existing clients also periodically purchase additional training consulting and minor programming services excluding the results of acquisitions software services revenue grew 3  compared to the prior year period this growth is due to a higher level of new software sales through both our license and subscription models 

maintenance 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our maintenance revenue for the years ended december 31 



we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and certain thirdparty software maintenance revenue grew 7  compared to the prior year maintenance and support revenue increased mainly due to growth in our installed customer base from new software license sales as well as annual maintenance rate increases 

appraisal services 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our appraisal services revenue for the years ended december 31 



in 2018  appraisal services revenue decreased 13  compared to the prior year primarily due to the successful completion of several large revaluation projects in mid2017 the appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states 

cost of revenues and gross margins 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues for the years ended december 31 



the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the years ended december 31 



software licenses royalties and acquired software  cost of software licenses royalties and acquired software is primarily comprised of amortization expense for acquired software and thirdparty software costs we do not have any direct costs associated with royalties the gross margin increase of 03 is due to higher software license revenues offset by an increase in amortization expense for acquired software attributed to new acquisitions completed in 2018 

software services maintenance and subscriptions  cost of software services maintenance and subscriptions primarily consists of personnel costs related to installation of our software conversion of client data training client personnel and support activities and various other services such as custom client development and ongoing operation of saas and efiling arrangements in 2018  the software services maintenance and subscriptions gross margin decreased 07  compared to the prior year excluding employees added through acquisitions our implementation and support staff has grown by 57  employees since december 31 2017  as we accelerated hiring to ensure that we are wellpositioned to deliver our current backlog and anticipated new business recognition of acquisitionrelated deferred revenue associated with subscriptions and maintenance also resulted in lower gross margins 

appraisal services  appraisal services revenue comprised approximately 23  of total revenue the appraisal services gross margin decreased 04  compared to 2017  due to the reduction in higher margin projects substantially complete by early 2017 and lower volume of revenues in the current period to cover relatively fixed costs 

our 2018  blended gross margin slightly decreased by 05  compared to 2017  our overall gross margin decrease is mainly attributed to additions to our implementation staff and lower margin revenues from appraisal services offset by improved margin on revenues from software licenses 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses consist primarily of salaries employee benefits travel sharebased compensation expense commissions and related overhead costs for administrative and sales and marketing employees as well as professional fees trade show activities advertising costs and other marketing related costs the following table sets forth a comparison of our sga expenses for the years ended december 31 



sga as a percentage of revenue was 222  in 2018  compared to 209  in 2017  sga expense increased approximately 18  compared to the prior year period in 2018 our operating results include 91 million of sga expenses for socrata from the date of acquisition the remaining sga expense increase is mainly due to compensation cost related to increased staff levels higher stock compensation expense and increased commission expense as a result of higher sales excluding employees added with acquisitions we have added 47  employees mainly to our sales and finance teams since december 31 2017  in addition our 2018  stock compensation expense rose 112 million  mainly due to increases in our stock price over the last few years 

research and development expense 

research and development expense consists primarily of salaries employee benefits and related overhead costs associated with new product development the following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the years ended december 31 



research and development expense increased 34  in 2018  compared to the prior year period mainly due to a number of new tyler product development initiatives across our product suites including increased investments in research and development at recently acquired businesses to support these initiatives our research and development staff has grown by 159  since december 31 2017  

amortization of customer and trade name intangibles 

acquisition intangibles are comprised of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that is allocated to acquired software leases and customer and trade name intangibles the remaining excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues while amortization expense of customer and trade name intangibles is recorded as operating expense the estimated useful lives of both customer and trade name intangibles range from five to 25 years the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the years ended december 31 



  

amortization of customer and trade name intangibles increased due to the impact of intangibles added with several acquisitions completed in 2017  and 2018  

estimated annual amortization expense relating to customer and trade name acquisition intangibles excluding acquired software for which the amortization expense is recorded as cost of revenues for the next five years is as follows in thousands 



amortization expense relating to acquired leases will be recorded as a reduction to hardware and other revenue and is expected to be 372000  in 2019  313000  in 2020  312000  in 2021  312000  in 2022  312000  in 2023  and 723000  thereafter  

other 

the following table sets forth a comparison of other income expense net for the years ended december 31 



other income is comprised of interest expense and nonusage and other fees associated with our revolving credit agreement as well as interest income from invested cash other income net increased compared to the prior period due to increased interest income from significantly higher levels of cash and investments resulting from cash generated in the last year we had no debt in the current period as we repaid all borrowings under the revolving line of credit in january 2017 

income tax provision benefit 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the years ended december 31 



the increase in the income tax provision in 2018  is primarily due to the onetime tax benefit of 260 million  as adjusted recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017  resulting from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the enactment of the tax act which reduced the statutory us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 the increase is somewhat offset by the decrease in statutory us federal corporate income tax rate for 2018  in addition excess tax benefits from stock option exercises were lower in 2018 as compared to the prior period stock option exercise activity in 2018  generated excess tax benefits of 325 million  while stock option exercise activity in 2017  generated 406 million  excess tax benefits 

the increase in the effective income tax rate in 2018  compared to 2017  is also primarily attributable to the onetime tax benefit associated with the tax act recognized in 2017 and the decrease in excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises realized offset by the decrease in statutory us federal corporate income tax rate for 2018  excluding the impact of the tax act and the excess tax benefits our income tax provision and effective tax rate in 2018  would have been 426 million  and 274  and in 2017  would have been 605 million  as adjusted and 370  respectively 

the effective income tax rates in both 2018  and 2017  differed from the statutory united states federal corporate income tax rate of 21 and 35 respectively due to state income taxes the research tax credit nondeductible sharebased compensation expense disqualifying incentive stock option dispositions and other nondeductible business expenses and in 2017  the domestic production activities deduction 

2017  compared to 2016   

revenues 

software licenses and royalties 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software licenses and royalties revenue for the years ended december 31 



software license and royalties revenue increased 3  compared to the prior year the increase in software licenses and royalties is attributed to additions to our implementation staff which increased our capacity to deliver backlog 

although the mix of new contracts between subscriptionbased and perpetual license arrangements may vary from quarter to quarter and year to year we expect our longerterm software license growth rate to be negatively impacted by a growing number of customers choosing our subscriptionbased options rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement subscriptionbased arrangements result in lower software license revenue in the initial year as compared to perpetual software license arrangements but generate higher overall revenue over the term of the contract our new client mix in 2017 was approximately 53 selecting perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 47 selecting subscriptionbased arrangements compared to a client mix in 2016 of approximately 68 selecting perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 32 selecting subscriptionbased arrangements 

subscriptions 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our subscriptions revenue for the years ended december 31 



subscriptionbased revenue primarily consists of revenue derived from our saas arrangements which generally utilize the tyler private cloud as part of our subscriptionbased services we also provide electronic document filing solutions “efiling” that simplify the filing and management of court related documents for courts and law offices efiling revenue is derived from transaction fees and fixed fee arrangements 

subscriptionbased revenue increased 21  compared to 2016 new saas clients as well as existing clients who converted to our saas model provided the majority of the subscriptions revenue increase in 2017 we added 374 new saas clients and 88 existing clients elected to convert to our saas model the average contract size in 2017 were 64and 44 higher than 2016 for new clients and clients converting to our saas model respectively also efiling services contributed approximately 85 million of the subscriptions revenue increase in 2017 the increase in efiling revenue is attributed to new efiling clients as well as increased volumes as the result of several existing clients mandating efiling 

software services 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software services revenue for the years ended december 31 



software services revenue primarily consists of professional services billed in connection with implementing our software converting client data training client personnel custom development activities and consulting new clients who purchase our proprietary software licenses generally also contract with us to provide for the related software services existing clients also periodically purchase additional training consulting and minor programming services software services revenue grew 5 compared to the prior year period this growth is partly due to additions to our implementation and support staff which increased our capacity to deliver backlog and partially due to completing recognition of a majority of the acquisitionrelated deferred service revenue that was fair valued at rates below tylers average service rate in prior periods 

maintenance 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our maintenance revenue for the years ended december 31 



we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and certain thirdparty software maintenance revenue grew 12 compared to the prior year maintenance and support revenue increased mainly due to growth in our installed customer base from new software license sales as well as annual maintenance rate increases in addition the increase is partially due to completing recognition of a majority of the acquisitionrelated deferred maintenance revenue that was fair valued at rates below tylers average maintenance rate in prior periods 

appraisal services 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our appraisal services revenue for the years ended december 31 



in 2017 appraisal services revenue decreased 5 compared to the prior year primarily due to the successful completion of several large revaluation projects in mid2017 the appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states 

cost of revenues and gross margins 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues for the years ended december 31 



the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the years ended december 31 



software licenses royalties and acquired software  cost of software licenses royalties and acquired software is primarily comprised of amortization expense for acquired software and thirdparty software costs we do not have any direct costs associated with royalties the gross margin increase of 11 is due to higher incremental margins on software license revenues in part due to slightly lower amortization expense for acquired software resulting from acquisitions 

software services maintenance and subscriptions  cost of software services maintenance and subscriptions primarily consists of personnel costs related to installation of our software conversion of client data training client personnel and support activities and various other services such as custom client development and ongoing operation of saas and efiling arrangements in 2017 the software services maintenance and subscriptions gross margin increased 05  compared to the prior year our implementation and support staff grew by 220 employees in 2017 many of these additions occurred in early to mid2017 and are contributing to revenue in 2017 costs related to maintenance and various other services such as saas and efiling typically grow at a slower rate than related revenue due to leverage in the utilization of support and maintenance staff and economies of scale reduced recognition of acquisitionrelated deferred revenue associated with software services and maintenance obligations completed in prior periods also resulted in higher gross margins 

appraisal services  appraisal services revenue comprised approximately 30 of total revenue the appraisal services gross margin decreased 27 compared to 2016 due to the reduction in higher margin projects substantially complete by early 2017 and lower volume of revenues in the current period to cover relatively fixed costs 

our 2017 blended gross margin slightly increased 02 compared to 2016 our overall gross margin was positively impacted by a product mix that included more highermargin recurring revenues from subscriptions and maintenance and improved margin on revenues from software licenses offset by the lowermargin revenues from appraisal services as described above 

selling general and administrative expenses 

the following table sets forth a comparison of selling general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31 

sga as a percentage of revenue was 209  in 2017 compared to 217  in 2016 sga expense increased approximately 7 mainly due to compensation costs related to increased staff levels merit increases and higher stock compensation expense we added 28 sga employees mainly to our sales and finance teams in 2017 in addition our 2017 stock compensation expense rose 47 million mainly due to increases in our stock price over the last few years 

research and development expense 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the years ended december 31 



research and development expense consists mainly of costs associated with development of new products and technologies from which we do not currently generate revenue as well as costs related to the ongoing development efforts for microsoft dynamics ax our contractual research and development commitment to develop public sector functionality for microsoft dynamics ax was amended in march 2016 which significantly reduced our development commitment through march 2018 however we continue to provide sustained engineering and technical support for the public sector functionality within dynamics ax license and maintenance royalties for all applicable domestic and international sales of dynamics ax to public sector entities will continue under the terms of the contract 

research and development expense increased 10 in 2017 compared to the prior year period mainly due to research and development efforts related to new tyler product development initiatives primarily in our public safety solutions offset by reduced development efforts for microsoft dynamics ax as a result of the microsoft dynamics ax amendment we have redeployed certain development resources to enhance functionality on several existing solutions and these costs are being recorded in cost of revenues – software services maintenance and subscriptions 

amortization of customer and trade name intangibles 

the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the years ended december 31 



amortization of customer and trade name intangibles increased due to the impact of intangibles added with several small acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2017 

other 

the following table sets forth a comparison of other income expense net for the years ended december 31 



other income expense is comprised of interest expense and nonusage and other fees associated with our revolving credit agreement as well as interest income from invested cash other income expense net increased compared to the prior period is attributed to significantly lower debt levels in the current period as we repaid all borrowings under the revolving line of credit in january 2017 and correspondingly higher levels of cash investments

the decrease in the income tax provision during 2017 was primarily driven by the enactment of the tax act which reduced the statutory us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 the impact of the rate reduction on our 2017 income tax provision is a 260 million  as adjusted tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities see note 7  income tax for additional information related to the tax act the income tax provision is also lower due to the increase in the excess tax benefits from stock option exercises as compared to prior period we experienced significant stock option exercise activity in 2017 and 2016 that generated excess tax benefits of 406 million and 296 million  respectively 

the change in the effective income tax rate in 2017 compared to 2016 is also primarily attributable to the impact of the tax act and the changes in excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises realized excluding the impact of the tax act and the excess tax benefits our income tax provision and effective tax rate in 2017 would have been 605 million  as adjusted and 370  respectively excluding the excess tax benefits our income tax provision and effective tax rate in 2016 would have been 515 million  as adjusted and 380  respectively 

the effective income tax rates in both 2017 and 2016 differed from the statutory united states federal corporate income tax rate of 35 due to state income taxes the domestic production activities deduction the research tax credit nondeductible sharebased compensation expense disqualifying incentive stock option dispositions and other nondeductible business expenses 

financial condition and liquidity 

as of december 31 2018  we had cash and cash equivalents of 1343 million  compared to 1859 million  at december 31 2017  we also had 977 million  invested in investment grade corporate bonds municipal bonds and assetbacked securities as of december 31 2018  compared to 638 million  at december 31 2017  these investments mature between 2018 through 2022  and we intend to hold these investments until maturity cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with several domestic banks and money market funds as of december 31 2018  we had no  outstanding borrowings and no outstanding letters of credit we believe our revolving line of credit cash from operating activities cash on hand and access to the credit markets provide us with sufficient flexibility to meet our longterm financial needs 

the following table sets forth a summary of cash flows for the years ended december 31 



net cash provided by operating activities continues to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures other potential capital resources include cash on hand public and private issuances of debt or equity securities and bank borrowings it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets in the future may be limited by economic conditions or other factors we currently believe that cash provided by operating activities cash on hand and available credit are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures income tax obligations and share repurchases for at least the next twelve months 

in 2018  operating activities provided cash of 2502 million  compared to 1958 million  in 2017  operating activities that provided cash were primarily comprised of net income of 1475 million  noncash depreciation and amortization charges of 618 million  and noncash sharebased compensation expense of 527 million  working capital excluding cash increased approximately 140 million  due to higher accounts receivable because of an increase in unbilled receivables attributed to revenues recognized from prior billings higher accounts receivable related to annual maintenance and subscription billings and the deferred taxes associated with stock option activity during the period these increases were offset slightly by the growth in deferred revenue balances and timing of income tax payments 

in general changes in the balance of deferred revenue are cyclical and primarily driven by the timing of our maintenance and subscription billings our renewal dates occur throughout the year but our largest maintenance renewal cycles occur in the second and fourth quarters 

days sales outstanding in accounts receivable were 111  days at december 31 2018  compared to 102  days at december 31 2017  the increase in our dso is mainly due to an increase in unbilled receivables attributed to the increase in software license revenue for which we have recognized revenue at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer but the billing has not yet been submitted to the customer an increase in software services contracts accounted for using progresstocompletion method of revenue recognition in which the services are performed in one accounting period but the billing normally occurs subsequently in another accounting period also contributed to the increase in dso furthermore our maintenance billing cycle typically peaks at its highest level in june and second highest level in december of each year and is followed by collections in the subsequent quarter dso is calculated based on quarterend accounts receivable excluding longterm receivables but including unbilled receivables divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by 360 days 

investing activities used cash of 2383 million  in 2018  compared to 854 million  in 2017  we invested 1156 million  and received 812 million  in proceeds from investment grade corporate bonds municipal bonds and assetbacked securities with maturity dates ranging from 2018 through 2022  approximately 274 million  was invested in property and equipment primarily for computer equipment furniture and fixtures in support of internal growth particularly with respect to our cloudbased offerings we paid 22 million  for the expansion of existing buildings on december 7 2018 we acquired certain assets and intellectual property of scenedoc inc a company that provides mobilefirst saas field reporting for law enforcement agencies the total purchase price was approximately 62 million  of which 54 million  was paid in cash and approximately 759000  accrued for a working capital holdback on october 1 2018 we acquired all of the equity interests of mobileeyes a company that develops software to improve public safety by supporting fire prevention and suppression emergency response and structural safety the total purchase price was approximately 53 million in cash on august 31 2018 we acquired all of the assets of caseloadpro a company that provides a fully featured probation case management system the purchase price of 93 million  was paid in cash on april 30 2018 we acquired all of the capital stock of socrata a company that provides open data and dataasaservice solutions including cloudbased data integration visualization analysis and reporting solutions for state and local government agencies the purchase price net of cash acquired of 17 million  was 1476 million  paid in cash on april 30 2018 we acquired all of the equity interests of sage a cybersecurity company offering a suite of services that supports an entire cybersecurity lifecycle including program development education and training technical testing advisory services and digital forensics the total purchase price was 116 million  paid in cash these expenditures were funded from cash generated from operations

tyler was founded in 1966 prior to 1998 we operated as a diversified industrial conglomerate with operations in various industrial retail and distribution businesses all of which have been divested in 1997 we embarked on a multiphase growth plan focused on serving the specialized information management needs of local governments nationwide we entered the local government it market through a series of strategic acquisitions in 1998 and 1999 

market overview 

the state and local government market is one of the largest and most decentralized it markets in the country consisting of all 50 states approximately 3000 counties 36000 cities and towns and 13900 school districts this market is also comprised of approximately 37000 special districts and other agencies each with specialized delegated responsibilities and unique information management requirements 

traditionally local government bodies and agencies performed statemandated duties including property assessment record keeping road maintenance law enforcement administration of election and judicial functions and the provision of welfare assistance today a host of emerging and urgent issues are confronting local governments each of which demands a service response these areas include criminal justice and corrections administration and finance public safety health and human services planning regulatory and maintenance and records and document management transfers of responsibility from the federal and state governments to county and municipal governments and agencies in these and other areas also place additional service and financial requirements on these local government units in addition constituents of local governments are increasingly demanding improved service and better access to information from public entities as a result local governments recognize the increasing value of information management systems and services to among other things improve revenue collection provide increased access to information and streamline delivery of services to their constituents local government bodies are now recognizing that “egovernment” is an additional responsibility for community development from integrated tax systems to integrated civil and criminal justice information systems many counties and cities have benefited significantly from the implementation of jurisdictionwide systems that allow different agencies or government offices to share data and provide a more comprehensive approach to information management many city and county governmental agencies also have unique individual information management requirements which must be tailored to the specific functions of each particular office 

many local governments also have difficulties attracting and retaining the staff necessary to support their it functions as a result they seek to establish longterm relationships with reliable providers of high quality it products and services such as tyler 

although local governments generally face budgetary constraints in their operations their primary revenue sources are usually property taxes and to a lesser extent utility billings and other fees which historically tend to be relatively stable in addition the acquisition of new technology typically enables local governments to operate more efficiently and often provides a measurable return on investment that justifies the purchase of software and related services 

gartner inc a leading information technology research and advisory company estimates that state and local government application and vertical specific software spending will grow from 147 billion in 2018 to 183 billion in 2021 the professional services and support segments of the market are expected to expand from 307 billion in 2018 to 344 billion in 2021 application and vertical specific software sales in the primary and secondary education segments of the market is expected to expand from 26 billion in 2018 to 33 billion in 2021 while professional services and support are expected to grow from 23 billion in 2018 to 25 billion in 2021

our objective is to grow our revenue and earnings organically supplemented by focused strategic acquisitions the key components of our business strategy are to 

• provide high quality value–added products and services to our clients  we compete on the basis of among other things delivering to clients our deep domain expertise in local government operations through the highest value products and services in the market we believe we have achieved a reputation as a premium product and service provider to the local government market 

• continue to expand our product and service offerings  while we already have what we believe to be the broadest line of software products for local governments we continually upgrade our core software applications and expand our complementary product and service offerings to respond to technological advancements and the changing needs of our clients in 2010 we began providing efiling for courts and law offices which simplifies the filing and management of court related documents we believe revenue from efiling solutions will continue to grow over time as more local and state governments mandate electronic document filings we also offer solutions that allow the public to access data and conduct transactions with local governments such as paying traffic tickets property taxes and utility bills online we believe that the addition of such features enhances the market appeal of our core products we have also broadened our offerings of consulting and business process reengineering services in november 2015 we significantly expanded our presence in the public safety software market through the acquisition of new world systems corporation 

• expand our client base  we seek to establish longterm relationships with new clients primarily through our sales and marketing efforts while we currently have clients in all 50 states canada the caribbean the united kingdom australia and other international locations not all of our solutions have achieved nationwide geographic penetration we intend to continue to expand into new geographic markets by adding sales staff and targeting marketing efforts by solutions in those areas we also intend to continue to expand our customer base to include more large governments while our traditional market focus has primarily been on small and midsized governments our increased size and market presence together with the technological advances and improved scalability of certain of our solutions are allowing us to achieve increasing success in selling to larger clients we also expect to expand our presence in international markets by leveraging our leadership position in the united states through the disciplined pursuit of selected opportunities in other countries 

• expand our existing client relationships  our existing customer base offers significant opportunities for additional sales of solutions and services that we currently offer but that existing clients do not fully utilize addon sales to existing clients typically involve lower sales and marketing expenses than sales to new clients 

• grow recurring revenues  we have a large recurring revenue base from maintenance and support and subscriptionbased services which generated revenues of 5351 million  or 64  of total revenues in 2017  we have historically experienced very low customer turnover approximately 2  annually and recurring revenues continue to grow as the installed customer base increases subscriptionbased revenues have been our fastest growing revenue category over the past five years increasing from 619 million  in 2013  to 1735 million  in 2017  

• maximize economies of scale and take advantage of financial leverage in our business  we seek to build and maintain a larger client base to create economies of scale enabling us to provide valueadded products and services to our clients while expanding our operating margins because we sell primarily “offtheshelf” software increased sales of the same solutions result in incrementally higher gross margins in addition we believe that we have a marketing and administrative infrastructure in place that can be leveraged to accommodate significant longterm growth without proportionately increasing selling general and administrative expenses 

• attract and retain highly qualified employees  we believe that the depth and quality of our management and staff is one of our significant strengths and that the ability to retain such employees is crucial to our continued growth and success we believe that our stable management team financial strength and growth opportunities as well as our leadership position in the local government market enhance our attractiveness as an employer for highly skilled employees 

• pursue selected strategic acquisitions  while we expect to primarily grow internally from time to time we selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that provide us with one or more of the following 

 • establish strategic alliances  in january 2007 we announced a strategic alliance with microsoft corporation to jointly develop core public sector functionality for microsoft dynamics ax to address the unique accounting needs of public sector organizations worldwide as part of this alliance we are enhancing microsoft dynamics ax with public sectorspecific functionality the arrangement has broadened the functionality of microsoft dynamics ax providing both tyler and microsoft with a public sector accounting platform to support their existing and prospective clients well into the future microsoft dynamics ax with public sector functionality was released to the market in august 2011 and is being sold in the united states and internationally through microsoft’s distribution channels tyler is also an authorized microsoft reseller for the microsoft dynamics solutions developed under this arrangement tyler receives license and maintenance royalties on direct and indirect publicsector sales worldwide 

our contractual research and development commitment to develop public sector functionality for microsoft dynamics ax was amended in march 2016 and significantly reduced our development commitment through march 2018 however we will continue to provide sustained engineering and technical support for the public sector functionality within dynamics ax 

sales marketing and clients 

we market our products and services through direct sales and marketing personnel located throughout the united states other inhouse sales staff focus on addon sales professional services and support 

sales of new systems are typically generated from referrals from other government offices or departments within a county or municipality referrals from other local governments relationships established between sales representatives and county or local officials contacts at trade shows direct mailings and direct contact from prospects already familiar with us we are active in numerous national state county and local government associations and participate in annual meetings trade shows and educational events 

clients consist primarily of county and municipal agencies school districts and other local government offices in counties clients include the auditor treasurer tax assessorcollector county clerk district clerk county and district court judges probation officers sheriff and county appraiser at municipal government sites clients include directors from various departments including administration finance utilities public works code enforcement personnel purchasing taxation municipal court and police contracts for software products and services are generally implemented over periods of three months to one year although some complex implementations may span multiple years with annually renewing maintenance and support update agreements thereafter although either the client or we can terminate these agreements historically almost all support and maintenance agreements are automatically renewed annually during 2017  approximately 43  of our revenue was attributable to ongoing support and maintenance agreements contracts for appraisal outsourcing services are generally one to three years in duration 

competition 

we compete with numerous local regional and national firms that provide or offer some or many of the same solutions and services that we provide many of these competitors are smaller companies that may be able to offer less expensive solutions than ours many of these firms operate within a specific geographic area andor in a narrow product or service niche we also compete with national firms some of which have greater financial and technical resources than we do including oracle corporation infor sap ag workday inc superion thomson reuters corporation and constellation software inc in addition we sometimes compete with consulting and systems integration firms which develop custom systems primarily for larger governments we also occasionally compete with central internal information service departments of local governments which requires us to persuade the enduser department to discontinue service by its own personnel and outsource the service to us 

we compete on a variety of factors including price service name recognition reputation technological capabilities and the ability to modify existing products and services to accommodate the individual requirements of the client our ability to offer an integrated system of applications for several offices or departments is often a competitive advantage local governmental units often are required to seek competitive proposals through a request for proposal process and some prospective clients use consultants to assist them with the proposal and vendor selection process 

suppliers 

substantially all of the computers peripherals printers scanners operating system software office automation software and other equipment necessary for the implementation and provision of our software systems and services are presently available from several thirdparty sources hardware is purchased on original equipment manufacturer or distributor terms at discounts from retail we have not experienced any significant supply problems 

backlog 

at december 31 2017  our estimated revenue backlog was approximately 11 billion  compared to 9533 million  at december 31 2016  the backlog represents signed contracts under which the revenue has not been recognized as of yearend approximately 5782 million  or 52  of the backlog is expected to be recognized during 2018  

intellectual property proprietary rights and licenses 

we regard certain features of our internal operations software and documentation as confidential and proprietary and rely on a combination of contractual restrictions trade secret laws and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property we generally do not rely on patents we believe that due to the rapid rate of technological change in the computer software industry trade secrets and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as knowledge ability and experience of our employees frequent product enhancements and timeliness and quality of support services we typically license our software products under nonexclusive license agreements which are generally nontransferable and have a perpetual term 

employees 

at december 31 2017  we had 4069  employees none of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to collective bargaining agreements we consider our relations with our employees to be positive 

internet website and availability of public filings

risk factors 

tableend an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk investors evaluating our company should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this annual report any of the following factors could materially harm our business operating results and financial condition additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business operating results and financial condition this section should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report we may make forwardlooking statements from time to time both written and oral we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forwardlooking statements our actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forwardlooking statements due to a number of factors including those set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report 

risks associated with our software products 

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities can disrupt our business and harm our competitive position 

threats to it security can take a variety of forms individuals and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations including statesponsored organizations may take steps that pose threats to our clients and our it they may develop and deploy malicious software to attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and data centers or act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks cyber threats are constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and clients breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications impair our ability to provide services to our clients and protect the privacy of their data result in product development delays compromise confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or otherwise adversely affect our business our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these evolving threats 

disclosure of personally identifiable information andor other sensitive client data could result in liability and harm our reputation 

we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable and other confidential information of our clients the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security despite our efforts to improve security controls it is possible our security controls over personal data our training of employees on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of client data that we store and manage disclosure of personally identifiable information andor other sensitive client data could result in liability and harm our reputation 

hosting services for some of our products are dependent upon the uninterrupted operation of data centers 

a material portion of our business is provided through software hosting services these hosting services depend on the uninterrupted operation of data centers and the ability to protect computer equipment and information stored in these data centers against damage that may be caused by natural disaster fire power loss telecommunications or internet failure acts of terrorism unauthorized intrusion computer viruses and other similar damaging events if any of our data centers were to become inoperable for an extended period we might be unable to fulfill our contractual commitments although we take what we believe to be reasonable precautions against such occurrences we can give no assurance that damaging events such as these will not result in a prolonged interruption of our services which could result in client dissatisfaction loss of revenue and damage to our business 

we run the risk of errors or defects with new products or enhancements to existing products 

our software products are complex and may contain errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released although we have not experienced material adverse effects from any such defects or errors to date we cannot assure you that material defects and errors will not be found in the future any such defects could result in a loss of revenues or delay market acceptance our license agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability however it is possible we may not always successfully negotiate such provisions in our client contracts or the limitation of liability provisions may not be effective due to existing or future federal state or local laws ordinances or judicial decisions although we maintain errors and omissions and general liability insurance and we try to structure contracts to limit liability we cannot assure you that a successful claim could not be made or would not have a material adverse effect on our future operating results 

we must timely respond to technological changes to be competitive 

the market for our products is characterized by technological change evolving industry standards in software technology changes in client requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments satisfy increasingly sophisticated client requirements and achieve market acceptance we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and costeffective manner the products capabilities or technologies developed by others could also render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to develop or acquire new software products or develop enhancements to existing products on a timely and costeffective basis or if such new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance 

we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights 

many of our product and service offerings incorporate proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of contracts copyrights and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology we cannot be certain that we have taken all appropriate steps to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property there has also been significant litigation recently involving intellectual property rights we are not currently involved in any material intellectual property litigation however we may be a party to such litigation in the future to protect our proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights we cannot assure you that thirdparties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us with respect to current or future products any claims or litigation with or without merit could be timeconsuming costly and a diversion to management any such claims and litigation could also cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements such royalty or licensing arrangements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all therefore litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business regardless of the final outcome of such litigation 

clients may elect to terminate our maintenance contracts and manage operations internally 

it is possible that our clients may elect to not renew maintenance contracts for our software trying instead to maintain and operate the software themselves using their perpetual license rights excluding software applications that we provide on a hosted or cloud basis this could adversely affect our revenues and profits additionally they may inadvertently allow our intellectual property or other information to fall into the hands of thirdparties including our competitors which could adversely affect our business 

material portions of our business require the internet infrastructure to be further developed or adequately maintained 

part of our future success depends on the use of the internet as a means to access public information and perform transactions electronically including for example electronic filing of court documents this in part requires the further development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure among other things this further development and maintenance will require a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed data capacity security and timely development of complementary products for providing reliable internet access and services if this infrastructure fails to be further developed or be adequately maintained our business would be harmed because users may not be able to access our government portals 

risks associated with selling products and services into the public sector marketplace 

selling products and services into the public sector poses unique challenges 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of software and services to state county and city governments other municipal agencies and other public entities we expect that sales to public sector clients will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues in the future we face many risks and challenges associated with contracting with governmental entities including 

 

 each of these risks is outside our control if we fail to adequately adapt to these risks and uncertainties our financial performance could be adversely affected 

a prolonged economic slowdown could harm our operations 

a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce demand for our software products and services local and state governments may face financial pressures that could in turn affect our growth rate and profitability in the future there is no assurance that local and state spending levels will be unaffected by declining or stagnant general economic conditions and if budget shortfalls occur they may negatively impact local and state it spending and could adversely affect our business 

the open bidding process creates uncertainty in predicting future contract awards 

many governmental agencies purchase products and services through an open bidding process generally a governmental entity will publish an established list of requirements requesting potential vendors to propose solutions for the established requirements to respond successfully to these requests for proposals we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract the time required to establish operations for the proposed client and the likely terms of any other thirdparty proposals submitted we cannot guarantee that we will win any bids in the future through the request for proposal process or that any winning bids will ultimately result in contracts on favorable terms our failure to secure contracts through the open bidding process or to secure such contracts on favorable terms may adversely affect our revenue and gross margins 

we face significant competition from other vendors and potential new entrants into our markets 

we believe we are a leading provider of integrated solutions for the public sector however we face competition from a variety of software vendors that offer products and services similar to those offered by us as well as from companies offering to develop custom software we compete based on a number of factors including 

 we believe the market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors that vary in size product platform and product scope our competitors include consulting firms publicly held companies that focus on selected segments of the public sector market and a significant number of smaller privately held companies certain competitors have greater technical marketing and financial resources than we do we cannot assure you that such competitors will not develop products or offer services that are superior to our products or services or that achieve greater market acceptance 

we also compete with internal centralized it departments of governmental entities which requires us to persuade the enduser to stop the internal service and outsource to us in addition our clients and prospective clients could elect to provide information management services internally through new or existing departments which could reduce the market for our services 

we could face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the public sector software application market and new products and technologies are introduced increased competition could result in pricing pressure fewer client orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with thirdparties thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective clients it is possible that new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect upon our business 

fixedprice contracts may affect our profits 

some of our contracts are structured on a fixedprice basis which can lead to various risks including 

 if we do not adequately assess and manage these and other risks we may be subject to cost overruns and penalties which may harm our financial performance 

changes in the insurance markets may affect our business 

some of our clients primarily those for our property appraisal services require that we secure performance bonds before they will select us as their vendor in addition we have in the past been required to provide letters of credit as security for the issuance of a performance bond we cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure such performance bonds in the future on terms that are favorable to us if at all our inability to obtain performance bonds on favorable terms or at all could impact our future ability to win some contract awards particularly large property appraisal services contracts which could negatively impact revenues in addition the general insurance markets may experience volatility which may lead to future increases in our general and administrative expenses and negatively impact our operating results 

risks associated with our periodic results and stock price 

software revenue recognition rules may require us to delay revenue recognition into future periods 

we have in the past had to and may in the future be required to defer revenue recognition for software license fees due to several factors including 

 because of these factors and other specific requirements for software revenue recognition under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states we must have very precise terms in our contracts to recognize revenue upon the delivery and installation of our software or performance of services negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions may extend the sales cycle we are not always able to negotiate terms and conditions that permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery or even upon project completion 

fluctuations in quarterly revenue could adversely impact our operating results and stock price 

our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter for a variety of reasons including 

 in each fiscal quarter our expense levels operating costs and hiring plans are based to some extent on projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed if our actual revenues fall below expectations we could experience a reduction in operating results also if actual revenues or earnings for any given quarter fall below expectations it may lead to a decline in our stock price 

increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins 

we realize lower margins on software and appraisal service revenues than on license revenue the majority of our contracts include both software licenses and software services therefore an increase in the percentage of software service and appraisal service revenue compared to license revenue could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and could adversely affect operating results 

our stock price may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile examples of factors that may significantly impact our stock price include 

 in addition the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of technology company stocks and may in the future adversely affect the market price of our stock sometimes securities class action litigation is filed following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities we cannot assure you that similar litigation will not occur in the future with respect to us such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect upon our financial performance 

our financial outlook may not be realized 

from time to time in press releases and otherwise we may publish forecasts or other forwardlooking statements regarding our results including estimated revenues or earnings any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties and as a matter of course any number of them may prove to be incorrect further the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors including those described in this discussion many of which are beyond our control as a result we cannot be certain that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse current and potential stockholders are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions but instead are encouraged to utilize our entire publicly available mix of historical and forwardlooking information as well as other available information regarding us our products and services and the software industry when evaluating our prospective results of operations 

risks associated with our growth strategy and other general corporate risks 

we may experience difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy 

a material portion of our historical growth has resulted from strategic acquisitions although our focus is on internal growth we will continue to identify and pursue strategic acquisitions with suitable candidates these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including risks that a transaction does not advance our business strategy that we do not achieve the expected return on our investment that we have difficulty integrating business systems and technology that we have difficulty retaining or integrating new employees that the transactions distract management from our other businesses that we acquire unforeseen liabilities and other unanticipated events our future success will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate future acquisitions into our operations it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits of these transactions such as increased revenue enhanced efficiencies or increased market share or the benefits may be ultimately less than we expected although we conduct due diligence reviews of potential acquisition candidates we may not identify all material liabilities or risks related to acquisition candidates there can be no assurance that any such strategic acquisitions will be accomplished on favorable terms or will result in profitable operations 

our failure to properly manage growth could adversely affect our business 

we have expanded our operations significantly since 1998 when we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector we intend to continue expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities this growth places significant demands on management and operational resources in order to manage growth effectively we must implement and improve our operational systems procedures and controls on a timely basis if we fail to implement these systems our business may be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to hire integrate and retain qualified personnel 

our continued success will depend upon the availability and performance of our key management sales marketing client support and product development personnel the loss of key management or technical personnel could adversely affect us we believe that our continued success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract integrate and retain such personnel we have at times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel competition for qualified software development sales and other personnel is intense and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance may result in additional expenses 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure can create uncertainty for public companies the costs required to comply with such evolving laws are difficult to predict to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards this investment may result in an unforeseen increase in general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenuegenerating activities which may harm our operating results 

we don’t foresee paying dividends on our common stock 

we have not declared nor paid a cash dividend since we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector in 1998 we intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law could deter takeover attempts 

our board of directors may issue up to 1000000 shares of preferred stock and may determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting and conversion rights of these preferred shares these determinations may be made without any further vote or action by our stockholders the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock in addition some provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and the delaware general corporation law could also delay prevent or make more difficult a merger tender offer or proxy contest involving us

on december 22 2017 the tax act was enacted the tax act amends the internal revenue code to reduce tax rates and modify policies credits and deductions for individuals and businesses for businesses the tax act reduces the us corporate federal tax rate from 35 to 21 and transitions from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system the impact of the rate reduction on our 2017 income tax provision is a 216 million  tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities refer to note 7 income tax for further discussion on the impact of the tax act 

we monitor and analyze several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance these indicators include the following 

revenues – we derive our revenues from five primary sources sale of software licenses and royalties subscriptionbased arrangements software services maintenance and appraisal services subscriptions and maintenance are considered recurring revenue sources and comprised approximately 64  of our revenue in 2017  the number of new saas clients and the number of existing clients who convert from our traditional software arrangements to our saas model are a significant driver to our business together with new software license sales and maintenance rate increases in addition we also monitor our customer base and churn as we historically have experienced very low customer turnover during 2017  based on our number of customers turnover was approximately 2  

cost of revenues and gross margins – our primary cost component is personnel expenses in connection with providing software implementation subscriptionbased services maintenance and support and appraisal services to our clients we can improve gross margins by controlling headcount and related costs and by expanding our revenue base especially from those products and services that produce incremental revenue with minimal incremental cost such as software licenses and royalties subscriptionbased services and maintenance and support our appraisal projects are cyclical in nature and we often employ appraisal personnel on a shortterm basis to coincide with the life of a project as of december 31 2017  our total employee count increased to 4069  from 3831  at december 31 2016  

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses – the primary components of sga expenses are administrative and sales personnel salaries and commissions sharebased compensation expense marketing expense rent and professional fees sales commissions typically fluctuate with revenues and sharebased compensation expense generally increases as the market price of our stock increases other administrative expenses tend to grow at a slower rate than revenues 

liquidity and cash flows – the primary driver of our cash flows is net income uses of cash include acquisitions capital investments in property and equipment and discretionary purchases of treasury stock our working capital needs are fairly stable throughout the year with the significant components of cash outflows being payment of personnel expenses offset by cash inflows representing collection of accounts receivable and cash receipts from clients in advance of revenue being earned in recent years we have also received significant amounts of cash from employees exercising stock options and contributing to our employee stock purchase plan 

balance sheet – cash accounts receivable and days sales outstanding and deferred revenue balances are important indicators of our business 

recent accounting guidance not yet adopted 

revenue from contracts with customers  on may 28 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” this asu is the result of a convergence project between the fasb and the international accounting standards board the core principle behind asu no 201409 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for delivering those goods and services this model involves a fivestep process that includes identifying the contract with the customer identifying the performance obligations in the contract determining the transaction price allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and recognizing revenue when or as the entity satisfies the performance obligations the asu allows two methods of adoption a full retrospective approach where three years of financial information are presented in accordance with the new standard and a modified retrospective approach where the asu is applied to the most current period presented in the financial statements we have adopted the new standard effective january 1 2018 using the full retrospective method which will require each prior reporting period presented to be recast in future issuance of our financial statements in preparation for adoption of the standard we have implemented internal controls and key system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information and have reached conclusions on key accounting assessments related to the standard during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 we have substantially completed data conversion activities required to recast our prior period results we continue to perform an indepth review of our preliminary results therefore we are in the process of completing our analysis necessary to recast prior period results we do not believe there are any remaining significant implementation topics associated with the adoption of this asu that have not yet been addressed 

this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets and statement of shareholders’ equity the impact of the standard on consolidated revenue and costs of revenue will be dependent upon the mix of revenue streams due to our accounting for software license fees allocation of discounts across all performance obligations and to the incremental costs of obtaining a contract specifically under the new standard software license fees under perpetual agreements will no longer be subject to 100 discount allocations from other elements in the contract discounts in arrangements will be allocated across all deliverables increasing license revenues and decreasing revenues allocated to other performance obligations in addition in most cases net license fees total license fees less any allocated discounts will be recognized at the point in time that control of the software license transfers to the customer versus our current policy of recognizing revenue only to the extent billable per the contractual terms timebased license fees currently recognized over the license term will no longer be recognized over the period of the license and will instead be recognized at the point in time that control of the software license transfers to the customer revenue related to our software as a service “saas” offerings postcontract customer support pcs renewals and professional services remain substantially unchanged due to the complexity of certain contracts the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will be dependent on contractspecific terms and may vary in some instances from recognition at the time of billing 

application of the new standard requires that incremental costs directly related to obtaining a contract typically sales commissions plus any associated fringe benefits must be recognized as an asset and expensed on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods and services to which the asset relates unless that life is less than one year currently we defer sales commissions and recognize expense over the relevant initial contractual term with the adoption of the new standard amortization periods will extend past the initial term 

leases on february 25 2016 the fasb issued its new lease accounting guidance in asu no 201602 “leases topic 842” under the new guidance lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases with the exception of shortterm leases at the commencement date 

 

lessees for capital and operating leases and lessors for salestype direct financing and operating leases must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements the modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach 

the asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2018 including interim periods therein early application is permitted for all business entities upon issuance we are assessing the financial impact of adopting the new standard however we are currently unable to provide a reasonable estimate regarding the financial impact we will adopt the new standard in fiscal year 2019 

outlook 

the local government software market continues to be active and our backlog at december 31 2017  reached 11 billion  a 18  increase from last year we expect to continue to achieve solid growth in revenue and earnings with our strong financial position and cash flow we plan to continue to make significant investments in product development to better position us to continue to expand our competitive position in the public sector software market over the long term 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements the reported amounts of revenues cost of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosure of contingencies the notes to the financial statements included as part of this annual report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the application of the percentageofcompletion and proportional performance methods of revenue recognition the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of intangible assets determination of sharebased compensation expense and valuation allowance for receivables we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards codification “asc” 605 revenue recognition and asc 985605 software revenue recognition our revenues are derived from sales of software licenses and royalties subscriptionbased services appraisal services maintenance and support and services that typically range from installation training and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs for multiple element software arrangements which do not entail the performance of services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software we generally record revenue when the delivered products or performed services result in a legally enforceable and nonrefundable claim we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized because most of our customers are governmental entities we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments in a limited number of cases we encounter a customer who is dissatisfied with some aspect of the software product or our service and we may offer a “concession” to such customer in those limited situations where we grant a concession we rarely reduce the contract arrangement fee but alternatively may perform additional services such as additional training or creating additional custom reports these amounts have historically been nominal in connection with our customer contracts and the adequacy of related allowances and measures of progress towards contract completion our project managers are charged with the responsibility to continually review the status of each customer on a specific contract basis also we review on at least a quarterly basis significant past due accounts receivable and the adequacy of related reserves events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments may require revision include but are not limited to deterioration of a customer’s financial condition failure to manage our customer’s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products 

we use contract accounting primarily the percentageofcompletion method as discussed in asc 60535 construction – type and certain production – type contracts for those software arrangements that involve significant production modification or customization of the software or where our software services are otherwise considered essential to the functionality of the software we measure progresstocompletion primarily using labor hours incurred or value added in addition we recognize revenue using the proportional performance method for our property appraisal projects some of which can range up to five years these methods rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue billings and collections and expected contract costs as well as measures of progress toward completion we believe reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs and progress applicable to various stages of a contract can be made at times we perform additional andor noncontractual services for little to no incremental fee to satisfy customer expectations if changes occur in delivery productivity or other factors used in developing our estimates of expected costs or revenues we revise our cost and revenue estimates and any revisions are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision first become known in connection with these and certain other contracts we may perform the work prior to when the services are billable andor payable pursuant to the contract the termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the value of products delivered and services performed in the event of an early termination 

for saas arrangements we evaluate whether the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and whether the customer can feasibly maintain the software on the customer’s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a thirdparty to host the software if we determine that the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and can feasibly maintain the software on the customer’s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a thirdparty to host the software we recognize the license professional services and hosting services revenues pursuant to asc 985605 software revenue recognition for saas arrangements that do not meet the criteria for recognition under asc 985605 we account for the elements under asc 60525 multiple element arrangements using all applicable facts and circumstances including whether i the element has standalone value ii there is a general right of return and iii the revenue is contingent on delivery of other elements we allocate the contract value to each element of the arrangement that qualifies for treatment as a separate element based on vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” and if vsoe is not available thirdparty evidence and if thirdparty evidence is unavailable estimated selling price for professional services associated with saas arrangements that we determine do not have standalone value to the customer or are contingent on delivery of other elements we recognize the services revenue ratably over the remaining contractual period once hosting has gone live and we may begin billing for the hosting services we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 

in connection with certain of our contracts we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet date many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period we review unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue in addition we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue which represents billings in excess of revenue earned the majority of this liability consists of maintenance billings for which payments are made in advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the maintenance period generally one year we also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit and the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product have not been met on a periodic basis we review by customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains appropriate 

intangible assets and goodwill  our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge the cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value with the excess allocated to goodwill accordingly we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets including software customer related intangibles trade name leases and goodwill these intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives we currently have no intangible assets with indefinite lives other than goodwill 

when testing goodwill for impairment quantitatively we first compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is performed to measure the amount of potential impairment in the second step we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized the fair values calculated in our impairment tests are determined using discounted cash flow models involving several assumptions the assumptions that are used are based upon what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain we evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by comparing the total of the fair value of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed quantitatively during the second quarter of 2017  did not result in an impairment charge during 2017  we did not identify any triggering events that would require an update to our annual impairment review 

all intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of other intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows the assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved such indicators may include among others a significant decline in expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition and reductions in growth rates in addition products capabilities or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or noncompetitive any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets 

sharebased compensation we have a stock option plan that provides for the grant of stock options to key employees directors and nonemployee consultants we estimate the fair value of sharebased awards on the date of grant using the blackscholes option valuation model sharebased compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures which will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from such estimates changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data 

we estimate stock price volatility at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock estimated option life is determined using the weightedaverage period the stock options are expected to be outstanding based primarily on the options’ vesting terms remaining contractual life and the employees’ expected exercise based on historical patterns determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates 

analysis of results of operations and other 

the following discussion compares the historical results of operations on a basis consistent with gaap for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



2017  compared to 2016   

revenues 

software licenses and royalties 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software licenses and royalties revenue for the years ended december 31 



software license and royalties revenue was flat compared to the prior year software license revenue declined as a percentage of the revenue mix due to an increase in the percentage of new software clients choosing our subscriptionbased option rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual license arrangement 

although the mix of new contracts between subscriptionbased and perpetual license arrangements may vary from quarter to quarter and year to year we expect our longerterm software license growth rate to be negatively impacted by a growing number of customers choosing our subscriptionbased options rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement subscriptionbased arrangements result in lower software license revenue in the initial year as compared to perpetual software license arrangements but generate higher overall revenue over the term of the contract our new client mix in 2017  was approximately 53  selecting perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 47  selecting subscriptionbased arrangements compared to a client mix in 2016  of approximately 68  selecting perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 32  selecting subscriptionbased arrangements 

subscriptions 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our subscriptions revenue for the years ended december 31 



subscriptionbased revenue primarily consists of revenue derived from our saas arrangements which utilize the tyler private cloud as part of our subscriptionbased services we also provide electronic document filing solutions “efiling” that simplify the filing and management of court related documents for courts and law offices efiling revenue is derived from transaction fees and fixed fee arrangements 

subscriptionbased revenue increased 22  compared to 2016  new saas clients as well as existing clients who converted to our saas model provided the majority of the subscriptions revenue increase in 2017  we added 374  new saas clients and 88  existing clients elected to convert to our saas model the average contract sizes in 2017  were 64  and 44  higher than 2016  for new clients and clients converting to our saas model respectively also efiling services contributed approximately  85 million  of the subscriptions revenue increase in 2017  the increase in efiling revenue is attributed to new efiling clients as well as increased volumes as the result of several existing clients mandating efiling 

software services 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software services revenue for the years ended december 31 



software services revenue primarily consists of professional services billed in connection with implementing our software converting client data training client personnel custom development activities and consulting new clients who purchase our proprietary software licenses generally also contract with us to provide for the related software services existing clients also periodically purchase additional training consulting and minor programming services software services revenue grew 7  compared to the prior year period this growth is partly due to additions to our implementation and support staff which increased our capacity to deliver backlog and partially due to completing recognition of a majority of the acquisitionrelated deferred service revenue that was fair valued at rates below tylers average service rate in prior periods 

maintenance 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our maintenance revenue for the years ended december 31 



we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and certain thirdparty software maintenance revenue grew 12  compared to the prior year maintenance and support revenue increased mainly due to growth in our installed customer base from new software license sales as well as annual maintenance rate increases in addition the increase is partially due to completing recognition of a majority of the acquisitionrelated deferred maintenance revenue that was fair valued at rates below tylers average maintenance rate in prior periods 

appraisal services 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our appraisal services revenue for the years ended december 31 



in 2017  appraisal services revenue decreased 5  compared to the prior year primarily due to the successful completion of several large revaluation projects in mid2017 the appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states 

cost of revenues and gross margins 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues for the years ended december 31 



the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the years ended december 31 



software licenses royalties and acquired software  cost of software licenses royalties and acquired software is primarily comprised of amortization expense for acquired software and thirdparty software costs we do not have any direct costs associated with royalties the gross margin increase of 09 is due to higher incremental margins on software license revenues in part due to slightly lower amortization expense for acquired software resulting from acquisitions 

software services maintenance and subscriptions  cost of software services maintenance and subscriptions primarily consists of personnel costs related to installation of our software conversion of client data training client personnel and support activities and various other services such as custom client development and ongoing operation of saas and efiling arrangements in 2017  the software services maintenance and subscriptions gross margin increased 08  compared to the prior year our implementation and support staff has grown by 220  employees since december 31 2016  many of these additions occurred in early to mid2017 and are contributing to revenue in 2017 costs related to maintenance and various other services such as saas and efiling typically grow at a slower rate than related revenue due to leverage in the utilization of support and maintenance staff and economies of scale reduced recognition of acquisitionrelated deferred revenue associated with software services and maintenance obligations completed in prior periods also resulted in higher gross margins 

appraisal services  appraisal services revenue comprised approximately 30  of total revenue the appraisal services gross margin decreased 27  compared to 2016  due to the reduction in higher margin projects substantially complete by early 2017 and lower volume of revenues in the current period to cover relatively fixed costs 

our 2017  blended gross margin increased 05  compared to 2016  our overall gross margin was positively impacted by a product mix that included more highermargin recurring revenues from subscriptions and maintenance and improved margin on revenues from software licenses offset by the lowermargin revenues from appraisal services as described above 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses consist primarily of salaries employee benefits travel sharebased compensation expense commissions and related overhead costs for administrative and sales and marketing employees as well as professional fees trade show activities advertising costs and other marketing related costs the following table sets forth a comparison of our sga expenses for the years ended december 31 



sga as a percentage of revenue was 211  in 2017  compared to 221  in 2016  sga expense increased approximately 6  mainly due to compensation costs related to increased staff levels merit increases and higher stock compensation expense we have added 28  employees mainly to our sales and finance teams since december 31 2016  in addition our 2017  stock compensation expense rose 47 million  mainly due to increases in our stock price over the last few years 

research and development expense 

research and development expense consists primarily of salaries employee benefits and related overhead costs associated with new product development the following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the years ended december 31 



research and development expense consists mainly of costs associated with development of new products and technologies from which we do not currently generate revenue as well as costs related to the ongoing development efforts for microsoft dynamics ax our contractual research and development commitment to develop public sector functionality for microsoft dynamics ax was amended in march 2016 which significantly reduced our development commitment through march 2018 however we will continue to provide sustained engineering and technical support for the public sector functionality within dynamics ax license and maintenance royalties for all applicable domestic and international sales of dynamics ax to public sector entities will continue under the terms of the contract 

research and development expense increased 10  in 2017  compared to the prior year period mainly due to research and development efforts related to new tyler product development initiatives primarily in our public safety solutions offset by reduced development efforts for microsoft dynamics ax as a result of the microsoft dynamics ax amendment we have redeployed certain development resources to enhance functionality on several existing solutions and these costs are being recorded in cost of revenues – software services maintenance and subscriptions 

amortization of customer and trade name intangibles 

acquisition intangibles are comprised of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that is allocated to acquired software leases and customer and trade name intangibles the remaining excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues while amortization expense of customer and trade name intangibles is recorded as operating expense the estimated useful lives of both customer and trade name intangibles range from five to 25 years the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the years ended december 31 



  

amortization of customer and trade name intangibles increased due to the impact of intangibles added with several small acquisitions completed in 2016  and 2017  

estimated annual amortization expense relating to customer and trade name acquisition intangibles excluding acquired software for which the amortization expense is recorded as cost of revenues for the next five years is as follows in thousands 



amortization expense relating to acquired leases will be recorded as a reduction to hardware and other revenue and is expected to be 425000  in 2018  373000  in 2019  313000  in 2020  312000  in 2021  312000  in 2022  and 10 million  thereafter  

other 

the following table sets forth a comparison of other income expense net for the years ended december 31 



other income expense is comprised of interest expense and nonusage and other fees associated with our revolving credit agreement as well as interest income from invested cash other income expense net decrease compared to the prior period is attributed to significantly lower debt levels in the current period as we repaid all borrowings under the revolving line of credit in january 2017 and correspondingly higher levels of cash investments 

income tax benefit provision 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the years ended december 31 



the decrease in the income tax provision during 2017 was primarily driven by the enactment of the tax act which reduced the statutory us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 the impact of the rate reduction on our 2017 income tax provision is a 216 million  tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities   see note 7  income tax for additional information related to the tax act the income tax provision is also lower due to the increase in the excess tax benefits from stock option exercises as compared to prior period we experienced significant stock option exercise activity in 2017  and 2016  that generated excess tax benefits of 406 million and 296 million  respectively 

the change in the effective income tax rate in 2017  compared to 2016  is also primarily attributable to the impact of the tax act and the changes in excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises realized excluding the impact of the tax act and the excess tax benefits our income tax provision and effective tax rate in 2017  would have been 599 million  and 371  respectively excluding the excess tax benefits our income tax provision and effective tax rate in 2016 would have been 490 million and 379 respectively 

the effective income tax rates in both 2017  and 2016  differed from the statutory united states federal corporate income tax rate of 35 due to state income taxes the domestic production activities deduction the research tax credit nondeductible sharebased compensation expense disqualifying incentive stock option dispositions and nondeductible business expenses 

2016  compared to 2015   

revenues 

on november 16 2015 we acquired nws which provides public safety and financial solutions for local governments in may 2015 we acquired a company which provides mobile handheld solutions primarily to law enforcement agencies for field accident reporting and electronically issuing citations the results of their operations are included in our es segment from their respective dates of acquisition for comparative purposes we have provided explanations for changes in operations to exclude results of operations for these acquisitions noting the exclusion 

software licenses and royalties 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software licenses and royalties revenue for the years ended december 31 



excluding the results of acquisitions software license revenue increased 3 compared to the prior year the majority of this growth was due to a more active marketplace as the result of improvement in local government economic conditions as well as our increasingly strong competitive position which we attribute in part to our investment in product development in recent years this increase was offset somewhat by lower sales to our existing customer base for courts and justice related addon solutions that assist and support the transition to a paperless environment by the end of 2015 the majority of our courts and justice clients had implemented these addon solutions 

although the mix of new contracts between subscriptionbased and perpetual license arrangements may vary from quarter to quarter and year to year our longerterm software license growth rate is negatively impacted by a growing number of customers choosing our subscriptionbased options rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement subscriptionbased arrangements result in lower software license revenue in the initial year as compared to perpetual software license arrangements but generate higher overall revenue over the term of the contract our new client mix in 2016 was approximately 68 selecting perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 32 selecting subscriptionbased arrangements compared to a client mix in 2015 of approximately 76 selecting perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 24 selecting subscriptionbased arrangements 250 new clients entered into subscriptionbased software arrangements in 2016 compared to 134 new clients in 2015 

subscriptions 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our subscriptions revenue for the years ended december 31 



subscriptionbased revenue primarily consists of revenue derived from our saas arrangements which utilize the tyler private cloud as part of our subscriptionbased services we also provide electronic document filing solutions “efiling” that simplify the filing and management of court related documents for courts and law offices efiling revenue is derived from transaction fees and fixed fee arrangements 

excluding acquisitions subscriptionbased revenue increased 24 compared to 2015 efiling services contributed approximately 49 million of the subscriptions revenue increase in 2016 most of the efiling revenue increase related to several statewide contracts several of which implemented mandatory electronic filing during 2015 and throughout 2016 new saas clients as well as existing clients who converted to our saas model provided the remainder of the subscriptions revenue increase in 2016 we added 250 new saas clients and 53 existing clients elected to convert to our saas model the average contract sizes in 2016 were 1 and 9 higher than 2015 for new clients and clients converting to our saas model respectively 

software services 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software services revenue for the years ended december 31 



software services revenue primarily consists of professional services billed in connection with implementing our software converting client data training client personnel custom development activities and consulting new clients who purchase our proprietary software licenses generally also contract with us to provide for the related software services existing clients also periodically purchase additional training consulting and minor programming services excluding the results of acquisitions software services revenue grew 11 compared to the prior year period this growth is partly due to additions to our implementation and support staff which increased our capacity to deliver backlog and a contract mix that included more custom development and other services 

maintenance 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our maintenance revenue for the years ended december 31 



we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and certain thirdparty software excluding the results of acquisitions maintenance revenue grew 9 compared to the prior year maintenance and support revenue increased mainly due to growth in our installed customer base from new software license sales as well as annual maintenance rate increases 

appraisal services 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our appraisal services revenue for the years ended december 31 



the appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states in 2016 appraisal services revenue increased 5 compared to prior year primarily due to the franklin county ohio revaluation project which began late in the fourth quarter of 2015 

cost of revenues and gross margins 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues for the years ended december 31 



the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the years ended december 31 



software licenses royalties and acquired software  cost of software licenses royalties and acquired software is primarily comprised of amortization expense for acquired software and thirdparty software costs we do not have any direct costs associated with royalties in 2016 our software licenses royalties and acquired software gross margin percentage declined compared to the prior year due to much higher amortization expense for acquired software resulting from our acquisition of nws excluding the results of nws our software license royalties and acquired software gross margin was 939 in 2016 compared to 936 in 2015 

software services maintenance and subscriptions  cost of software services maintenance and subscriptions primarily consists of personnel costs related to installation of our software conversion of client data training client personnel and support activities and various other services such as custom client development and ongoing operation of saas and efiling arrangements in 2016 the software services maintenance and subscriptions gross margin increased 29 compared to the prior year our implementation and support staff grew by 169 employees in 2016 to support sales growth we began making significant investments in our implementation and support staff in early 2015 since december 31 2014 excluding acquisitions we added 369 implementation and support employees these additions contributed to the revenue growth in 2016 in addition the nws revenue mix included a lower proportion of software services compared to tyler’s historical revenue mix which also benefited the gross margin costs related to maintenance and various other services such as saas and efiling typically grow at a slower rate than related revenue due to leverage in the utilization of support and maintenance staff and economies of scale maintenance and subscription price increases also resulted in slightly higher gross margins 

appraisal services  appraisal services revenue comprised approximately 35 of total revenue the appraisal services gross margin increased 11 compared to 2015 a high proportion of the costs of appraisal services revenue are variable as we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects whose term of employment generally ends with the projects’ completion 

our 2016 blended gross margin remained consistent compared to 2015 our overall gross margin was positively impacted by improved utilization of our support and maintenance staff however this benefit was offset by amortization expense for acquired software related to the nws acquisition 

selling general and administrative expenses 

the following table sets forth a comparison of selling general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31 

sga as a percentage of revenue was 221 in 2016 compared to 226 in 2015 in 2015 our sga expense included approximately 59 million for financial advisory legal accounting due diligence valuation and other various expenses necessary to complete the nws acquisition excluding nws transaction costs and sga from acquisitions sga expense increased approximately 12 mainly due to compensation costs related to increased staff levels higher stock compensation expense and increased commission expense as a result of higher sales we added 22 employees mainly to our sales and finance teams in 2016 in addition our 2016 stock compensation expense rose 64 million mainly due to increases in our stock price over the last few years 

     research and development expense 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the years ended december 31 



research and development expense consists mainly of costs associated with development of new products and technologies from which we do not currently generate revenue as well as costs related to the ongoing development efforts for microsoft dynamics ax our contractual research and development commitment to develop public sector functionality for microsoft dynamics ax was amended in march 2016 which significantly reduced our development commitment through march 2018 however we will continue to provide sustained engineering and technical support for the public sector functionality within dynamics ax license and maintenance royalties for all applicable domestic and international sales of dynamics ax to public sector entities will continue under the terms of the contract 

excluding the results of acquisitions research and development expense increased 15 in 2016 compared to the prior year period mainly due to research and development efforts related to new tyler product development initiatives as a result of the microsoft dynamics ax amendment we also redeployed certain development resources to enhance functionality on several existing solutions and these costs were recorded in cost of sales – software services maintenance and subscriptions 

      amortization of customer and trade name intangibles 

the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the years ended december 31 



amortization of customer and trade name intangibles increased substantially from the comparable prior year periods due to the acquisition of nws in november 2015 

other 

the following table sets forth a comparison of other expense income net for the years ended december 31 



other expense income is comprised of interest expense and nonusage and other fees associated with our revolving credit agreement as well as interest income from invested cash in 2015 we had significantly higher invested cash balances and no outstanding debt until we completed the nws acquisition on november 16 2015 

income tax provision 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the years ended december 31 



the decrease in the income tax provision during 2016 was primarily driven by the adoption of asu no 201609 which requires the excess tax benefits from stock option exercises to be recognized as a reduction of the income tax provision whereas they previously were accounted for as an increase to shareholders’ equity the adoption of asu no 201609 resulted in a 296 million decrease in our full year 2016 provision for income taxes 

excluding the excess tax benefits our income tax provision and effective tax rate in 2016 would have been 490 million and 379 respectively 

the effective income tax rates in both 2016 and 2015 also differed from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of 35 due to state income taxes the domestic production activities deduction nondeductible sharebased compensation expense disqualifying incentive stock option dispositions and nondeductible business expenses we realized a lower domestic production activities deduction as a result of taxable income limitations and nondeductible transaction costs related to the nws acquisition negatively impacted our 2015 effective tax rate in the past few years a relatively high amount of excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises have resulted in a reduction in our qualified manufacturing activities deduction the qualified manufacturing activities deduction can be limited to a certain level of taxable income on the tax return therefore any significant items that reduce taxable income such as excess tax benefits on stock options can reduce the amount of the qualified manufacturing activities deduction we experienced significant stock option exercise activity in 2016 and 2015 that generated excess tax benefits of 296 million and 453 million respectively 

financial condition and liquidity 

as of december 31 2017  we had cash and cash equivalents of 1859 million  compared to 362 million  at december 31 2016  we also had 638 million  invested in investment grade corporate bonds municipal bonds and assetbacked securities as of december 31 2017  these investments mature between 2017 through 2021  and we intend to hold these investments until maturity cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with several domestic banks and money market funds as of december 31 2017  we had no  outstanding borrowings and one outstanding letter of credit totaling 05 million  in favor of a client contract the letter of credit guarantees our performance under the contract and expires in 2018  we believe our revolving line of credit cash from operating activities cash on hand and access to the credit markets provide us with sufficient flexibility to meet our longterm financial needs 

the following table sets forth a summary of cash flows for the years ended december 31 



net cash provided by operating activities continues to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures other potential capital resources include cash on hand public and private issuances of debt or equity securities and bank borrowings it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets in the future may be limited by economic conditions or other factors we currently believe that cash provided by operating activities cash on hand and available credit are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures income tax obligations and share repurchases for at least the next twelve months 

in 2017  operating activities provided cash of 1958 million  compared to 1919 million  in 2016  operating activities that provided cash were primarily comprised of net income of 1639 million  noncash depreciation and amortization charges of 539 million  and noncash sharebased compensation expense of 373 million  working capital excluding cash increased approximately 636 million  million mainly due to higher accounts receivable related to annual maintenance and subscription billings as well as milestone billings for several contracts timing of income tax payments and the deferred taxes associated with stock option activity during the period these increases were offset slightly by the growth in deferred revenue balances and timing of payments of payroll related taxes and vendor invoices 

in general changes in the balance of deferred revenue are cyclical and primarily driven by the timing of our maintenance renewal billings our renewal dates occur throughout the year but our largest renewal cycles occur in the second and fourth quarters 

days sales outstanding in accounts receivable were 94  days at december 31 2017  compared to 93  days at december 31 2016  dso is calculated based on quarterend accounts receivable excluding longterm receivables but including unbilled receivables divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by 360 days 

investing activities used cash of 854 million  in 2017  compared to 507 million  in 2016  we invested 598 million  and received 288 million  in proceeds from investment grade corporate bonds municipal bonds and assetbacked securities with maturity dates ranging from 2017 through 2021  approximately 431 million  was invested in property and equipment we purchased an office building in latham new york for approximately 29 million  and paid 21 million  for building improvements we paid 194 million  for construction to expand our office building in yarmouth maine we also made three small acquisitions with a combined cash purchase price of 113 million  the remaining additions were for computer equipment furniture and fixtures in support of internal growth particularly with respect to our cloudbased offerings these expenditures were funded from cash generated from operations

in 2015 we completed the acquisition of nws for the purchase price of 3375 million in cash of which 40 million was accrued at december 31 2015 and 21 million shares of tyler common stock valued at 3628 million also we completed a small acquisition with a purchase price of 61 million in cash and 12500 shares of tyler common stock valued at 15 million and we made a 150 million investment in convertible preferred stock representing a 20 interest in record holdings pty limited we also invested 309 million in investment grade corporate and municipal bonds the remaining use of cash was for capital expenditures related to computer equipment furniture and fixtures in support of internal growth particularly with respect to growth in our cloudbased offerings these expenditures were funded from cash generated from operations cash on hand and bank borrowings

financing activities in 2016 were comprised of 560 million net payments on our revolving line of credit offset somewhat by collections of 298 million from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan activity we also purchased approximately 882000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 1127 million of which 860000 was accrued at december 31 2016 cash provided by financing activities in 2015 resulted from net borrowings of 660 million and collections of 278 million from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan activity we also purchased approximately 5400 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 645000 in 2015 and paid 21 million in debt issuance costs 

on may 11 2016 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 15 million shares of tyler common stock the repurchase program which was approved by our board of directors was announced in october 2002 and was amended at various times from 2003 through 2016 as of december 31 2017  we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to 20 million  additional shares of our common stock our share repurchase program allows us to repurchase shares at our discretion market conditions influence the timing of the buybacks and the number of shares repurchased as well as the volume of employee stock option exercises share repurchases are generally funded using our existing cash balances and borrowings under our credit facility and may occur through open market purchases and transactions structured through investment banking institutions privately negotiated transactions andor other mechanisms there is no expiration date specified for the authorization and we intend to repurchase stock under the plan from time to time 

on november 16 2015  we entered into a 3000 million  credit agreement the “credit facility” with the various lenders party thereto and wells fargo bank national association as administrative agent the credit facility provides for a revolving credit line of up to  3000 million  including a 100 million  sublimit for letters of credit the credit facility matures on november 16 2020  borrowings under the credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes including working capital requirements acquisitions and share repurchases borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a rate of either 1 wells fargo bank’s prime rate subject to certain higher rate determinations plus a margin of 025  to 100  or 2 the 30 60 90 or 180 day libor rate plus a margin of 125  to 200  as of december 31 2017  our interest rate was 475  under the prime rate option or approximately 278  under the 30day libor option the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets the credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial conditions and prohibits us from making certain investments advances cash dividends or loans and limits incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens as of december 31 2017  we were in compliance with those covenants  

  

as of december 31 2017  we had no  outstanding borrowings and had unused borrowing capacity of 2995 million  under the credit facility  we paid interest of 804000  in 2017  19 million  in 2016  and 223000  in 2015  

we paid income taxes net of refunds received of 360 million  in 2017  302 million  in 2016  and 273 million  in 2015  in 2017 we experienced significant stock option exercise activity that generated net tax benefits of 406 million  and reduced tax payments accordingly in 2016 and 2015 excess tax benefits were 296 million and 453 million respectively 

the tax act enacted on december 22 2017 reduced the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 we expect that the tax act will have a positive impact on liquidity in future years due to the decrease in the us corporate income tax rate 

we anticipate that 2018 capital spending will be between 22 million and 25 million including approximately 1 million related to real estate we expect the majority of the other capital spending will consist of computer equipment and software for infrastructure replacements and expansion we currently do not expect to capitalize significant amounts related to software development in 2018 but the actual amount and timing of those costs and whether they are capitalized or expensed may result in additional capitalized software development capital spending is expected to be funded from existing cash balances cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving line of credit 

from time to time we engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates in order to pursue such opportunities which could require significant commitments of capital we may be required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive securities in the future no assurance can be given as to our future acquisition opportunities and how such opportunities will be financed 

we lease office facilities as well as transportation computer and other equipment used in our operations under noncancelable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through 2025  most leases contain renewal options and some contain purchase options 

summarized in the table below are our obligations to make future payments under our credit facility and lease obligations at december 31 2017  in thousands

tyler was founded in 1966 prior to 1998 we operated as a diversified industrial conglomerate with operations in various industrial retail and distribution businesses all of which have been divested in 1997 we embarked on a multiphase growth plan focused on serving the specialized information management needs of local governments nationwide we entered the local government it market through a series of strategic acquisitions in 1998 and 1999 

market overview 

the state and local government market is one of the largest and most decentralized it markets in the country consisting of all 50 states approximately 3000 counties 36000 cities and towns and 13900 school districts this market is also comprised of approximately 37000 special districts and other agencies each with specialized delegated responsibilities and unique information management requirements 

traditionally local government bodies and agencies performed statemandated duties including property assessment record keeping road maintenance law enforcement administration of election and judicial functions and the provision of welfare assistance today a host of emerging and urgent issues are confronting local governments each of which demands a service response these areas include criminal justice and corrections administration and finance public safety health and human services planning regulatory and maintenance and records and document management transfers of responsibility from the federal and state governments to county and municipal governments and agencies in these and other areas also place additional service and financial requirements on these local government units in addition constituents of local governments are increasingly demanding improved service and better access to information from public entities as a result local governments recognize the increasing value of information management systems and services to among other things improve revenue collection provide increased access to information and streamline delivery of services to their constituents local government bodies are now recognizing that “egovernment” is an additional responsibility for community development from integrated tax systems to integrated civil and criminal justice information systems many counties and cities have benefited significantly from the implementation of jurisdictionwide systems that allow different agencies or government offices to share data and provide a more comprehensive approach to information management many city and county governmental agencies also have unique individual information management requirements which must be tailored to the specific functions of each particular office 

many local governments also have difficulties attracting and retaining the staff necessary to support their it functions as a result they seek to establish longterm relationships with reliable providers of high quality it products and services such as tyler 

although local governments generally face budgetary constraints in their operations their primary revenue sources are usually property taxes and to a lesser extent utility billings and other fees which historically tend to be relatively stable in addition the acquisition of new technology typically enables local governments to operate more efficiently and often provides a measurable return on investment that justifies the purchase of software and related services 

gartner inc a leading information technology research and advisory company estimates that state and local government application and vertical specific software spending will grow from 127 billion in 2017 to 155 billion in 2020 the professional services and support segments of the market are expected to expand from 311 billion in 2017 to 351 billion in 2020 application and vertical specific software sales in the primary and secondary education segments of the market is expected to expand from 23 billion in 2017 to 29 billion in 2020 while professional services and support are expected to grow from 21 billion in 2017 to 24 billion in 2020

we are able to provide the majority of our software products through our saas model the clients who choose this model typically do not wish to maintain update and operate these systems or make upfront capital expenditures to implement these advanced technologies the contract terms for these arrangements range from one to 10 years but are typically contracted for initial periods of five to seven years the majority of our saas or hosting arrangements include additional professional services as well as maintenance and support services in certain arrangements the client may also acquire a license to the software 

as part of our subscriptionbased services we provide efiling solutions that simplify the filing and management of court related documents for courts and law offices revenues for efiling are included in subscriptionbased revenues and are derived from transaction fees and in some cases fixed fee arrangements 

software services 

we provide a variety of professional it services to clients who utilize our software products virtually all of our clients contract with us for installation training and data conversion services in connection with their purchase of tyler’s software solutions the complete implementation process for a typical system includes planning design data conversion setup and testing at the culmination of the implementation process a data implementation team travels to the client’s facility to ensure the smooth golive with the new system data implementation fees are charged separately to clients on either a fixedfee or hourly charge basis depending on the contract 

both in connection with the installation of new systems and on an ongoing basis we provide extensive training services and programs related to our products and services training can be provided in our training centers onsite at clients’ locations or at meetings and conferences and can be customized to meet clients’ requirements the vast majority of our clients contract with us for training services both to improve their employees’ proficiency and productivity and to fully utilize the functionality of our systems training services are generally billed on an hourly or daily basis along with travel and other expenses 

maintenance and support 

following the implementation of our software systems we provide ongoing software support services to assist our clients in operating the systems and to periodically update the software support is provided to clients over the phone or via the web through help desks staffed by our client support representatives for more complicated issues our staff with the client’s permission can log on to clients’ systems remotely we maintain our clients’ software largely through releases that contain improvements and incremental additions of features and functionality along with updates necessary because of legislative or regulatory changes 

virtually all of our software clients contract with us for maintenance and support which provides us with a significant source of recurring revenue we generally provide maintenance and support for our onpremises clients under annual or in some cases multiyear contracts with a typical fee based on a percentage of the software product’s license fee these fees can generally be increased on renewal and may also increase as new license fees increase maintenance and support fees are generally paid annually in advance most maintenance contracts automatically renew unless the client or tyler gives notice of termination prior to expiration similar support is provided to our saas clients and is included in their subscription fees which are classified as subscriptionbased revenues 

appraisal services 

we are the nation’s largest provider of property appraisal outsourcing services for local government taxing authorities these services include 

 local government taxing authorities normally reappraise properties from time to time to update values for tax assessment purposes and to maintain equity in the taxing process in some jurisdictions law mandates reassessment cycles in others they are discretionary while some taxing jurisdictions perform reappraisals inhouse many local governments outsource this function because of its cyclical nature and because of the specialized knowledge and expertise requirements associated with it our appraisal services business unit has been in this business since 1938 

in some instances we also sell property tax andor appraisal software products in connection with appraisal outsourcing projects while other clients may only engage us to provide appraisal services appraisal outsourcing services are somewhat seasonal in nature to the extent that winter weather conditions reduce the productivity of data collection activities in connection with those projects 

strategy 

our objective is to grow our revenue and earnings organically supplemented by focused strategic acquisitions the key components of our business strategy are to 

• provide high quality value–added products and services to our clients  we compete on the basis of among other things delivering to clients our deep domain expertise in local government operations through the highest value products and services in the market we believe we have achieved a reputation as a premium product and service provider to the local government market 

• continue to expand our product and service offerings  while we already have what we believe to be the broadest line of software products for local governments we continually upgrade our core software applications and expand our complementary product and service offerings to respond to technological advancements and the changing needs of our clients in 2010 we began providing efiling for courts and law offices which simplifies the filing and management of court related documents we believe revenue from efiling solutions will continue to grow over time as more local and state governments mandate electronic document filings we also offer solutions that allow the public to access data and conduct transactions with local governments such as paying traffic tickets property taxes and utility bills via the internet we believe that the addition of such features enhances the market appeal of our core products we have also broadened our offerings of consulting and business process reengineering services in november 2015 we significantly expanded our presence in the public safety software market through the acquisition of new world systems corporation 

• expand our client base  we seek to establish longterm relationships with new clients primarily through our sales and marketing efforts while we currently have clients in all 50 states canada the caribbean the united kingdom and other international locations not all of our solutions have achieved nationwide geographic penetration we intend to continue to expand into new geographic markets by adding sales staff and targeting marketing efforts by solutions in those areas we also intend to continue to expand our customer base to include more large governments while our traditional market focus has primarily been on small and midsized governments our increased size and market presence together with the technological advances and improved scalability of certain of our solutions are allowing us to achieve increasing success in selling to larger clients we also expect to expand our presence in international markets by leveraging our leadership position in the united states through the disciplined pursuit of selected opportunities in other countries 

• expand our existing client relationships  our existing customer base offers significant opportunities for additional sales of solutions and services that we currently offer but that existing clients do not fully utilize addon sales to existing clients typically involve lower sales and marketing expenses than sales to new clients 

• grow recurring revenues  we have a large recurring revenue base from maintenance and support and subscriptionbased services which generated revenues of 4657 million  or 62  of total revenues in 2016  we have historically experienced very low customer turnover approximately 2  annually and recurring revenues continue to grow as the installed customer base increases subscriptionbased revenues have been our fastest growing revenue category over the past five years increasing from 446 million  in 2012  to 1427 million  in 2016  

• maximize economies of scale and take advantage of financial leverage in our business  we seek to build and maintain a larger client base to create economies of scale enabling us to provide valueadded products and services to our clients while expanding our operating margins because we sell primarily “offtheshelf” software increased sales of the same solutions result in incrementally higher gross margins in addition we believe that we have a marketing and administrative infrastructure in place that can be leveraged to accommodate significant longterm growth without proportionately increasing selling general and administrative expenses 

• attract and retain highly qualified employees  we believe that the depth and quality of our operations management and staff is one of our significant strengths and that the ability to retain such employees is crucial to our continued growth and success we believe that our stable management team financial strength and growth opportunities as well as our leadership position in the local government market enhance our attractiveness as an employer for highly skilled employees 

• pursue selected strategic acquisitions  while we expect to primarily grow internally from time to time we selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that provide us with one or more of the following 

 • establish strategic alliances  in january 2007 we announced a strategic alliance with microsoft corporation to jointly develop core public sector functionality for microsoft dynamics ax to address the unique accounting needs of public sector organizations worldwide as part of this alliance we are enhancing microsoft dynamics ax with public sectorspecific functionality the arrangement has broadened the functionality of microsoft dynamics ax providing both tyler and microsoft with a public sector accounting platform to support their existing and prospective clients well into the future microsoft dynamics ax with public sector functionality was released to the market in august 2011 and is being sold in the united states and internationally through microsoft’s distribution channels tyler is also an authorized microsoft reseller for the microsoft dynamics solutions developed under this arrangement and we are selling the solutions directly into the government market tyler receives license and maintenance royalties on direct and indirect publicsector sales worldwide 

our contractual research and development commitment to develop public sector functionality for microsoft dynamics ax was amended in march 2016 and significantly reduced our development commitment through march 2018 however we will continue to provide sustained engineering and technical support for the public sector functionality within dynamics ax 

sales marketing and clients 

we market our products and services through direct sales and marketing personnel located throughout the united states other inhouse sales staff focus on addon sales professional services and support 

sales of new systems are typically generated from referrals from other government offices or departments within a county or municipality referrals from other local governments relationships established between sales representatives and county or local officials contacts at trade shows direct mailings and direct contact from prospects already familiar with us we are active in numerous national state county and local government associations and participate in annual meetings trade shows and educational events 

clients consist primarily of county and municipal agencies school districts and other local government offices in counties clients include the auditor treasurer tax assessorcollector county clerk district clerk county and district court judges probation officers sheriff and county appraiser at municipal government sites clients include directors from various departments including administration finance utilities public works code enforcement personnel purchasing taxation municipal court and police contracts for software products and services are generally implemented over periods of three months to one year although some complex implementations may span multiple years with annually renewing maintenance and support update agreements thereafter although either the client or we can terminate these agreements historically almost all support and maintenance agreements are automatically renewed annually during 2016  approximately 43  of our revenue was attributable to ongoing support and maintenance agreements contracts for appraisal outsourcing services are generally one to three years in duration 

competition 

we compete with numerous local regional and national firms that provide or offer some or many of the same solutions and services that we provide many of these competitors are smaller companies that may be able to offer less expensive solutions than ours many of these firms operate within a specific geographic area andor in a narrow product or service niche we also compete with national firms some of which have greater financial and technical resources than we do including oracle corporation infor sap ag fis sungard thomson reuters corporation and constellation software inc in addition we sometimes compete with consulting and systems integration firms which develop custom systems primarily for larger governments we also occasionally compete with central internal information service departments of local governments which requires us to persuade the enduser department to discontinue service by its own personnel and outsource the service to us 

we compete on a variety of factors including price service name recognition reputation technological capabilities and the ability to modify existing products and services to accommodate the individual requirements of the client our ability to offer an integrated system of applications for several offices or departments is often a competitive advantage local governmental units often are required to seek competitive proposals through a request for proposal process and some prospective clients use consultants to assist them with the proposal and vendor selection process 

suppliers 

substantially all of the computers peripherals printers scanners operating system software office automation software and other equipment necessary for the implementation and provision of our software systems and services are presently available from several thirdparty sources hardware is purchased on original equipment manufacturer or distributor terms at discounts from retail we have not experienced any significant supply problems 

backlog 

at december 31 2016  our estimated revenue backlog was approximately 9533 million  compared to 8445 million  at december 31 2015  the backlog represents signed contracts under which the revenue has not been recognized as of yearend approximately 5802 million  or 61  of the backlog is expected to be recognized during 2017 

intellectual property proprietary rights and licenses 

we regard certain features of our internal operations software and documentation as confidential and proprietary and rely on a combination of contractual restrictions trade secret laws and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property we generally do not rely on patents we believe that due to the rapid rate of technological change in the computer software industry trade secrets and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as knowledge ability and experience of our employees frequent product enhancements and timeliness and quality of support services we typically license our software products under nonexclusive license agreements which are generally nontransferable and have a perpetual term 

employees 

at december 31 2016  we had 3831  employees none of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to collective bargaining agreements we consider our relations with our employees to be positive

risk factors 

tableend an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk investors evaluating our company should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this annual report any of the following factors could materially harm our business operating results and financial condition additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business operating results and financial condition this section should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report we may make forwardlooking statements from time to time both written and oral we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forwardlooking statements our actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forwardlooking statements due to a number of factors including those set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report 

risks associated with our software products 

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities can disrupt our business and harm our competitive position 

threats to it security can take a variety of forms individuals and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations including statesponsored organizations may take steps that pose threats to our clients and our it they may develop and deploy malicious software to attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and data centers or act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks cyber threats are constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and clients breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications impair our ability to provide services to our clients and protect the privacy of their data result in product development delays compromise confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or otherwise adversely affect our business our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these evolving threats 

we may not be able to fully protect client information from security breaches 

as we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloudbased offerings we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable and other confidential information of our clients the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security despite our efforts to improve security controls it is possible our security controls over personal data our training of employees on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of client data that we store and manage improper disclosure could harm our reputation lead to legal exposure to clients or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 

hosting services for some of our products are dependent upon the uninterrupted operation of data centers 

a material portion of our business is provided through software hosting services these hosting services depend on the uninterrupted operation of data centers and the ability to protect computer equipment and information stored in these data centers against damage that may be caused by natural disaster fire power loss telecommunications or internet failure acts of terrorism unauthorized intrusion computer viruses and other similar damaging events if any of our data centers were to become inoperable for an extended period we might be unable to fulfill our contractual commitments although we take what we believe to be reasonable precautions against such occurrences we can give no assurance that damaging events such as these will not result in a prolonged interruption of our services which could result in client dissatisfaction loss of revenue and damage to our business 

we run the risk of errors or defects with new products or enhancements to existing products 

our software products are complex and may contain errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released although we have not experienced material adverse effects from any such defects or errors to date we cannot assure you that material defects and errors will not be found in the future any such defects could result in a loss of revenues or delay market acceptance our license agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability however it is possible we may not always successfully negotiate such provisions in our client contracts or the limitation of liability provisions may not be effective due to existing or future federal state or local laws ordinances or judicial decisions although we maintain errors and omissions and general liability insurance and we try to structure contracts to limit liability we cannot assure you that a successful claim could not be made or would not have a material adverse effect on our future operating results 

we must timely respond to technological changes to be competitive 

the market for our products is characterized by technological change evolving industry standards in software technology changes in client requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments satisfy increasingly sophisticated client requirements and achieve market acceptance we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and costeffective manner the products capabilities or technologies developed by others could also render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to develop or acquire new software products or develop enhancements to existing products on a timely and costeffective basis or if such new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance 

we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights 

many of our product and service offerings incorporate proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of contracts copyrights and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology we cannot be certain that we have taken all appropriate steps to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property there has also been significant litigation recently involving intellectual property rights we are not currently involved in any material intellectual property litigation however we may be a party to such litigation in the future to protect our proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights we cannot assure you that thirdparties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us with respect to current or future products any claims or litigation with or without merit could be timeconsuming costly and a diversion to management any such claims and litigation could also cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements such royalty or licensing arrangements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all therefore litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business regardless of the final outcome of such litigation 

clients may elect to terminate our maintenance contracts and manage operations internally 

it is possible that our clients may elect to not renew maintenance contracts for our software trying instead to maintain and operate the software themselves using their perpetual license rights excluding software applications that we provide on a hosted or cloud basis this could adversely affect our revenues and profits additionally they may inadvertently allow our intellectual property or other information to fall into the hands of thirdparties including our competitors which could adversely affect our business 

material portions of our business require the internet infrastructure to be further developed or adequately maintained 

part of our future success depends on the use of the internet as a means to access public information and perform transactions electronically including for example electronic filing of court documents this in part requires the further development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure among other things this further development and maintenance will require a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed data capacity security and timely development of complementary products for providing reliable internet access and services if this infrastructure fails to be further developed or be adequately maintained our business would be harmed because users may not be able to access our government portals 

risks associated with selling products and services into the public sector marketplace 

selling products and services into the public sector poses unique challenges 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of software and services to state county and city governments other municipal agencies and other public entities we expect that sales to public sector clients will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues in the future we face many risks and challenges associated with contracting with governmental entities including 

 

 each of these risks is outside our control if we fail to adequately adapt to these risks and uncertainties our financial performance could be adversely affected 

a prolonged economic slowdown could harm our operations 

a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce demand for our software products and services local and state governments may face financial pressures that could in turn affect our growth rate and profitability in the future there is no assurance that local and state spending levels will be unaffected by declining or stagnant general economic conditions and if budget shortfalls occur they may negatively impact local and state it spending and could adversely affect our business 

a decline in the demand for it may result in a decrease in our revenues or lower our growth rate 

a decline in the demand for it among our current and prospective clients may result in decreased revenues or a lower growth rate because our sales depend in part on our clients’ level of funding for new or additional it systems and services moreover demand for our solutions may be reduced by a decline in overall demand for computer software and services we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase or maintain our revenues 

the open bidding process creates uncertainty in predicting future contract awards 

many governmental agencies purchase products and services through an open bidding process generally a governmental entity will publish an established list of requirements requesting potential vendors to propose solutions for the established requirements to respond successfully to these requests for proposals we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract the time required to establish operations for the proposed client and the likely terms of any other thirdparty proposals submitted we cannot guarantee that we will win any bids in the future through the request for proposal process or that any winning bids will ultimately result in contracts on favorable terms our failure to secure contracts through the open bidding process or to secure such contracts on favorable terms may adversely affect our revenue and gross margins 

we face significant competition from other vendors and potential new entrants into our markets 

we believe we are a leading provider of integrated solutions for the public sector however we face competition from a variety of software vendors that offer products and services similar to those offered by us as well as from companies offering to develop custom software we compete based on a number of factors including 

 we believe the market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors that vary in size product platform and product scope our competitors include consulting firms publicly held companies that focus on selected segments of the public sector market and a significant number of smaller privately held companies certain competitors have greater technical marketing and financial resources than we do we cannot assure you that such competitors will not develop products or offer services that are superior to our products or services or that achieve greater market acceptance 

we also compete with internal centralized it departments of governmental entities which requires us to persuade the enduser to stop the internal service and outsource to us in addition our clients and prospective clients could elect to provide information management services internally through new or existing departments which could reduce the market for our services 

we could face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the public sector software application market and new products and technologies are introduced increased competition could result in pricing pressure fewer client orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with thirdparties thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective clients it is possible that new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect upon our business 

fixedprice contracts may affect our profits 

some of our contracts are on a fixedpriced basis which can lead to various risks including 

 if we do not adequately assess these and other risks we may be subject to cost overruns and penalties which may harm our financial performance 

changes in the insurance markets may affect our business 

some of our clients primarily those for our property appraisal services require that we secure performance bonds before they will select us as their vendor in addition we have in the past been required to provide letters of credit as security for the issuance of a performance bond we cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure such performance bonds in the future on terms that are favorable to us if at all our inability to obtain performance bonds on favorable terms or at all could impact our future ability to win some contract awards particularly large property appraisal services contracts which could negatively impact revenues in addition the general insurance markets may experience volatility which may lead to future increases in our general and administrative expenses and negatively impact our operating results 

risks associated with our periodic results and stock price 

software revenue recognition rules may require us to delay revenue recognition into future periods 

we have in the past had to and may in the future be required to defer revenue recognition for software license fees due to several factors including 

 because of these factors and other specific requirements for software revenue recognition under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states we must have very precise terms in our contracts to recognize revenue upon the delivery and installation of our software or performance of services negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions may extend the sales cycle we are not always able to negotiate terms and conditions that permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery or even upon project completion 

fluctuations in quarterly revenue could adversely impact our operating results and stock price 

our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter for a variety of reasons including the following 

 in each fiscal quarter our expense levels operating costs and hiring plans are based to some extent on projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed if our actual revenues fall below expectations we could experience a reduction in operating results also if actual revenues or earnings for any given quarter fall below expectations it may lead to a decline in our stock price 

increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins 

we realize lower margins on software and appraisal service revenues than on license revenue the majority of our contracts include both software licenses and software services therefore an increase in the percentage of software service and appraisal service revenue compared to license revenue could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and could adversely affect operating results 

our stock price may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile examples of factors that may significantly impact our stock price include 

 in addition the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of technology company stocks and may in the future adversely affect the market price of our stock sometimes securities class action litigation is filed following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities we cannot assure you that similar litigation will not occur in the future with respect to us such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect upon our financial performance 

financial outlook 

from time to time in press releases and otherwise we may publish forecasts or other forwardlooking statements regarding our results including estimated revenues or earnings any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties and as a matter of course any number of them may prove to be incorrect further the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors including those described in this discussion many of which are beyond our control as a result we cannot be certain that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse current and potential stockholders are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions but instead are encouraged to utilize our entire publicly available mix of historical and forwardlooking information as well as other available information regarding us our products and services and the software industry when evaluating our prospective results of operations 

risks associated with our growth strategy and other general corporate risks 

we may experience difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy 

a material portion of our historical growth has resulted from strategic acquisitions although our focus is on internal growth we will continue to identify and pursue strategic acquisitions with suitable candidates these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including the transaction does not advance our business strategy we get no satisfactory return on our investment we have difficulty integrating business systems and technology we have difficulty retaining or integrating new employees the transactions distract management from our other businesses we acquire unforeseen liabilities and other unanticipated events our future success will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate future acquisitions into our operations it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits of these transactions such as increased revenue enhanced efficiencies or increased market share or the benefits may be ultimately smaller than we expected although we conduct due diligence reviews of potential acquisition candidates we may not identify all material liabilities or risks related to acquisition candidates there can be no assurance that any such strategic acquisitions will be accomplished on favorable terms or will result in profitable operations 

our failure to properly manage growth could adversely affect our business 

we have expanded our operations significantly since 1998 when we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector we intend to continue expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities this growth places a significant demand on management and operational resources in order to manage growth effectively we must implement and improve our operational systems procedures and controls on a timely basis if we fail to implement these systems our business may be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to hire integrate and retain qualified personnel 

our continued success will depend upon the availability and performance of our key management sales marketing client support and product development personnel the loss of key management or technical personnel could adversely affect us we believe that our continued success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract integrate and retain such personnel we have at times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel competition for qualified software development sales and other personnel is intense and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance may result in additional expenses 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure can create uncertainty for public companies the costs required to comply with such evolving laws are difficult to predict to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards this investment may result in an unforeseen increase in general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenuegenerating activities which may harm our operating results 

we don’t foresee paying dividends on our common stock 

we have not declared or paid a cash dividend since we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector in 1998 we intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law could deter takeover attempts 

our board of directors may issue up to 1000000 shares of preferred stock and may determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting and conversion rights of these preferred shares these determinations may be made without any further vote or action by our stockholders the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock in addition some provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and the delaware general corporation law could also delay prevent or make more difficult a merger tender offer or proxy contest involving us

total organic revenues increased 12  in 2016  compared to 2015  

on november 16 2015 we acquired all of the capital stock of new world systems corporation “nws” which provides public safety and financial solutions for local governments the purchase price net of cash acquired of 225 million was 3375 million in cash of which 40 million was accrued at december 31 2015 and 21 million shares of tyler common stock valued at 3628 million 

on may 29 2015 we acquired all of the capital stock of brazos technology corporation “brazos” which provides mobile hand held solutions primarily to law enforcement agencies for field accident reporting and electronically issuing citations the purchase price net of cash acquired and including debt assumed was 61 million in cash and 12500 shares of tyler common stock valued at 15 million 

the operating results of nws and brazos are included with the operating results of the enterprise software segment since their respective dates of acquisition 

we monitor and analyze several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance these indicators include the following 

revenues – we derive our revenues from five primary sources sale of software licenses and royalties subscriptionbased arrangements software services maintenance and appraisal services subscriptions and maintenance are considered recurring revenue sources and comprised approximately 62  of our revenue in 2016  the number of new saas clients and the number of existing clients who convert from our traditional software arrangements to our saas model are a significant driver to our business together with new software license sales and maintenance rate increases in addition we also monitor our customer base and churn as we historically have experienced very low customer turnover during 2016  based on our number of customers turnover was approximately 2  

cost of revenues and gross margins – our primary cost component is personnel expenses in connection with providing software implementation subscriptionbased services maintenance and support and appraisal services to our clients we can improve gross margins by controlling headcount and related costs and by expanding our revenue base especially from those products and services that produce incremental revenue with minimal incremental cost such as software licenses and royalties subscriptionbased services and maintenance and support our appraisal projects are cyclical in nature and we often employ appraisal personnel on a shortterm basis to coincide with the life of a project as of december 31 2016  our total employee count increased to 3831  from 3586  at december 31 2015  

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses – the primary components of sga expenses are administrative and sales personnel salaries and commissions sharebased compensation expense marketing expense rent and professional fees sales commissions typically fluctuate with revenues and sharebased compensation expense generally increases when the market price of our stock increases other administrative expenses tend to grow at a slower rate than revenues in 2015 sga expenses include approximately 59 million for financial advisory legal accounting due diligence valuation and other various services necessary to complete the nws acquisition 

liquidity and cash flows – the primary driver of our cash flows is net income uses of cash include acquisitions capital investments in property and equipment and discretionary purchases of treasury stock our working capital needs are fairly stable throughout the year with the significant components of cash outflows being payment of personnel expenses offset by cash inflows representing collection of accounts receivable and cash receipts from clients in advance of revenue being earned in recent years we have also received significant amounts of cash from employees exercising stock options and contributing to our employee stock purchase plan 

balance sheet – cash accounts receivable and days sales outstanding and deferred revenue balances are important indicators of our business 

new accounting pronouncements adopted in 2016 

improvements to employee sharebased payment accountin g in march 2016 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update asu no 201609 compensationstock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee sharebased payment transactions including the accounting for income taxes forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements as well as classification in the statement of cash flows this standard is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning december 15 2016 and early adoption is permitted we elected to early adopt this standard in fourth quarter of 2016 the impact of the early adoption was as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

adoption of the new standard resulted in the recognition of excess tax benefits in our provision for income taxes rather than apic of 296 million  for the period ended december 31 2016 as of december 31 2016 the change in the calculation of common stock equivalents added approximately 519000  weighted average shares for the diluted earnings per share calculations the impact to our previously reported quarterly results for fiscal year 2016 is as follows 



presentation of financial statements  going concern  in august 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201415 presentation of financial statements  going concern subtopic 20540 disclosure of uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern the guidance requires an entity to evaluate whether there are conditions or events in the aggregate that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or within one year after the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances the guidance is effective for the annual period ending after december 15 2016 and for annual and interim periods thereafter we adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of 2016 and its adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

recent accounting guidance not yet adopted 

revenue from contracts with customers  on may 28 2014 fasb issued asu no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” this asu is the result of a convergence project between the fasb and the international accounting standards board the core principle behind asu no 201409 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for delivering those goods and services this model involves a fivestep process that includes identifying the contract with the customer identifying the performance obligations in the contract determining the transaction price allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and recognizing revenue when or as the entity satisfies the performance obligations the asu allows two methods of adoption a full retrospective approach where three years of financial information are presented in accordance with the new standard and a modified retrospective approach where the asu is applied to the most current period presented in the financial statements we currently anticipate adopting the standard using the full retrospective method to restate each prior reporting period presented our ability to adopt using the full retrospective method is dependent on system readiness including software procured from thirdparty providers and the completion of our analysis of information necessary to restate prior period financial statements 

the new standard requires application no later than annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 including interim reporting periods therein however public entities are permitted to elect to early adopt the new standard we are assessing the financial impact of adopting the new standard and the methods of adoption however we are currently unable to provide a reasonable estimate regarding the financial impact we will adopt the new standard in fiscal year 2018 

we anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements while we are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the standard we currently believe the most significant impact relates to our accounting for software license fees installation fees and incremental cost of obtaining a contract specifically under the new standard we expect software license fees under perpetual agreements will no longer be subject to 100 discount allocations from other elements in the contract discounts in arrangements will be allocated across all deliverables increasing license revenues and decreasing revenues allocated to other performance obligations in addition in most cases net license fees total license fees less any allocated discounts will be recognized at the point in time that control of the software license transfers to the customer versus our current policy of recognizing revenue only to the extent billable per the contractual terms timebased license fees currently recognized over the license term will no longer be recognized over the period of the license and will instead be recognized at the point in time that control of the software license transfers to the customer installation fees will no longer be considered distinct performance obligations and therefore will be recognized over the term of the arrangement or life of the performance obligation we expect revenue related to our saas offerings and professional services to remain substantially unchanged due to the complexity of certain contracts the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will be dependent on contractspecific terms and may vary in some instances from recognition at the time of billing application of the new standard requires that incremental costs directly related to obtaining a contract typically sales commissions plus any associated fringe benefits must be recognized as an asset and expensed over the expected life of the arrangement unless that life is less than one year currently we defer sales commissions and recognize expense over the relevant initial contractual term with the adoption the new standard we expect amortization periods to extend past the initial term 

leases on february 25 2016 the fasb issued its new lease accounting guidance in asu no 201602 “leases topic 842” under the new guidance lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases with the exception of shortterm leases at the commencement date 

 

lessees for capital and operating leases and lessors for salestype direct financing and operating leases must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements the modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach 

the asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2018 including interim periods therein early application is permitted for all business entities upon issuance we are assessing the financial impact of adopting the new standard however we are currently unable to provide a reasonable estimate regarding the financial impact we expect to adopt the new standard in fiscal year 2019 

outlook 

activity in the local government software market continues to be robust and our backlog at december 31 2016  reached 9533 million  a 13  increase from last year we expect to continue to achieve solid growth in revenue and earnings with our strong financial position and cash flow we plan to continue to make significant investments in product development to better position us to continue to expand our competitive position in the public sector software market over the long term 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements the reported amounts of revenues cost of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosure of contingencies the notes to the financial statements included as part of this annual report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the application of the percentageofcompletion and proportional performance methods of revenue recognition the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of intangible assets determination of sharebased compensation expense and valuation allowance for receivables we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards codification “asc” 605 revenue recognition and asc 985605 software revenue recognition our revenues are derived from sales of software licenses and royalties subscriptionbased services appraisal services maintenance and support and services that typically range from installation training and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs for multiple element software arrangements which do not entail the performance of services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software we generally record revenue when the delivered products or performed services result in a legally enforceable and nonrefundable claim we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized because most of our customers are governmental entities we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments in a limited number of cases we encounter a customer who is dissatisfied with some aspect of the software product or our service and we may offer a “concession” to such customer in those limited situations where we grant a concession we rarely reduce the contract arrangement fee but alternatively may perform additional services such as additional training or creating additional custom reports these amounts have historically been nominal in connection with our customer contracts and the adequacy of related allowances and measures of progress towards contract completion our project managers are charged with the responsibility to continually review the status of each customer on a specific contract basis also we review on at least a quarterly basis significant past due accounts receivable and the adequacy of related reserves events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments may require revision include but are not limited to deterioration of a customer’s financial condition failure to manage our customer’s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products 

we use contract accounting primarily the percentageofcompletion method as discussed in asc 60535 construction – type and certain production – type contracts for those software arrangements that involve significant production modification or customization of the software or where our software services are otherwise considered essential to the functionality of the software we measure progresstocompletion primarily using labor hours incurred or value added in addition we recognize revenue using the proportional performance method for our property appraisal projects some of which can range up to five years these methods rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue billings and collections and expected contract costs as well as measures of progress toward completion we believe reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs and progress applicable to various stages of a contract can be made at times we perform additional andor noncontractual services for little to no incremental fee to satisfy customer expectations if changes occur in delivery productivity or other factors used in developing our estimates of expected costs or revenues we revise our cost and revenue estimates and any revisions are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision first become known in connection with these and certain other contracts we may perform the work prior to when the services are billable andor payable pursuant to the contract the termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the value of products delivered and services performed in the event of an early termination 

for saas arrangements we evaluate whether the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and whether the customer can feasibly maintain the software on the customer’s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a thirdparty to host the software if we determine that the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and can feasibly maintain the software on the customer’s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a thirdparty to host the software we recognize the license professional services and hosting services revenues pursuant to asc 985605 software revenue recognition for saas arrangements that do not meet the criteria for recognition under asc 985605 we account for the elements under asc 60525 multiple element arrangements using all applicable facts and circumstances including whether i the element has standalone value ii there is a general right of return and iii the revenue is contingent on delivery of other elements we allocate the contract value to each element of the arrangement that qualifies for treatment as a separate element based on vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” and if vsoe is not available thirdparty evidence and if thirdparty evidence is unavailable estimated selling price for professional services associated with saas arrangements that we determine do not have standalone value to the customer or are contingent on delivery of other elements we recognize the services revenue ratably over the remaining contractual period once hosting has gone live and we may begin billing for the hosting services we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 

in connection with certain of our contracts we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet date many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period we review unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue in addition we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue which represents billings in excess of revenue earned the majority of this liability consists of maintenance billings for which payments are made in advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the maintenance period generally one year we also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit and the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product have not been met on a periodic basis we review by customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains appropriate 

intangible assets and goodwill  our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge the cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value with the excess allocated to goodwill accordingly we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets including software customer related intangibles trade name leases and goodwill these intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives we currently have no intangible assets with indefinite lives other than goodwill 

when testing goodwill for impairment quantitatively we first compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is performed to measure the amount of potential impairment in the second step we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized the fair values calculated in our impairment tests are determined using discounted cash flow models involving several assumptions the assumptions that are used are based upon what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain we evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by comparing the total of the fair value of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed quantitatively during the second quarter of 2016 did not result in an impairment charge during 2016 we did not identify any triggering events that would require an update to our annual impairment review 

all intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of other intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows the assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved such indicators may include among others a significant decline in expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition and reductions in growth rates in addition products capabilities or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or noncompetitive any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets 

sharebased compensation we have a stock option plan that provides for the grant of stock options to key employees directors and nonemployee consultants we estimate the fair value of sharebased awards on the date of grant using the blackscholes option 

valuation model sharebased compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures which will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from such estimates changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data our policy to estimate the impact of the forfeitures remains in accordance with the newly adopted accounting standard asu no 201609 

we estimate stock price volatility at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock estimated option life is determined using the weightedaverage period the stock options are expected to be outstanding based primarily on the options’ vesting terms remaining contractual life and the employees’ expected exercise based on historical patterns determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates 

analysis of results of operations and other 

the following discussion compares the historical results of operations on a basis consistent with gaap for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  



2016 compared to 2015 

revenues 

on november 16 2015 we acquired nws which provides public safety and financial solutions for local governments in may 2015 we acquired a company which provides mobile handheld solutions primarily to law enforcement agencies for field accident reporting and electronically issuing citations the results of their operations are included in our es segment from their respective dates of acquisition for comparative purposes we have provided explanations for changes in operations to exclude results of operations for these acquisitions noting the exclusion 

software licenses and royalties 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software licenses and royalties revenue for the years ended december 31 



excluding the results of acquisitions software license revenue increased 3  compared to the prior year the majority of this growth was due to a more active marketplace as the result of improvement in local government economic conditions as well as our increasingly strong competitive position which we attribute in part to our investment in product development in recent years this increase was offset somewhat by lower sales to our existing customer base for courts and justice related addon solutions that assist and support the transition to a paperless environment by the end of 2015 the majority of our courts and justice clients had implemented these addon solutions 

although the mix of new contracts between subscriptionbased and perpetual license arrangements may vary from quarter to quarter and year to year we expect our longerterm software license growth rate to be negatively impacted by a growing number of customers choosing our subscriptionbased options rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement subscriptionbased arrangements result in lower software license revenue in the initial year as compared to perpetual software license arrangements but generate higher overall revenue over the term of the contract our new client mix in 2016  was approximately 68  selecting perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 32  selecting subscriptionbased arrangements compared to a client mix in 2015  of approximately 76 selecting perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 24 selecting subscriptionbased arrangements 250  new clients entered into subscriptionbased software arrangements in 2016  compared to 134 new clients in 2015  

subscriptions 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our subscriptions revenue for the years ended december 31 



subscriptionbased services revenue primarily consists of revenue derived from our saas arrangements which utilize the tyler private cloud as part of our subscriptionbased services we also provide electronic document filing solutions “efiling” that simplify the filing and management of court related documents for courts and law offices efiling revenue is derived from transaction fees and fixed fee arrangements 

excluding acquisitions subscriptionbased services revenue increased 24  compared to 2015  efiling services contributed approximately  49 million  of the subscriptions revenue increase in 2016  most of the efiling revenue increase related to several statewide contracts several of which implemented mandatory electronic filing during 2015  and throughout 2016  new saas clients as well as existing clients who converted to our saas model provided the remainder of the subscriptions revenue increase in 2016  we 

added 250  new saas clients and 53  existing clients elected to convert to our saas model the average contract sizes in 2016  were 1  and 9  higher than 2015  for new clients and clients converting to our saas model respectively 

software services 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software services revenue for the years ended december 31 



software services revenue primarily consists of professional services billed in connection with implementing our software converting client data training client personnel custom development activities and consulting new clients who purchase our proprietary software licenses generally also contract with us to provide for the related software services existing clients also periodically purchase additional training consulting and minor programming services excluding the results of acquisitions software services revenue grew 11  compared to the prior year period this growth is partly due to additions to our implementation and support staff which increased our capacity to deliver backlog and a contract mix that included more custom development and other services 

maintenance 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our maintenance revenue for the years ended december 31 



we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and certain thirdparty software excluding the results of acquisitions maintenance revenue grew 9  compared to the prior year maintenance and support revenue increased mainly due to growth in our installed customer base from new software license sales as well as annual maintenance rate increases 

appraisal services 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our appraisal services revenue for the years ended december 31 



the appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states in 2016 appraisal services revenue increased 5  compared to prior year primarily due to the franklin county ohio revaluation project which began late in the fourth quarter of 2015 

cost of revenues and gross margins 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues for the years ended december 31 



the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the years ended december 31 



software licenses royalties and acquired software  costs of software licenses royalties and acquired software are primarily comprised of amortization expense for acquired software and thirdparty software costs we do not have any direct costs associated with royalties in 2016 our software licenses royalties and acquired software gross margin percentage declined compared to the prior year due to much higher amortization expense for acquired software resulting from our acquisition of nws excluding the results of nws our software license royalties and acquired software gross margin was 939 in 2016 compared to 936 in 2015 

software services maintenance and subscriptions  cost of software services maintenance and subscriptions primarily consists of personnel costs related to installation of our software conversion of client data training client personnel and support activities and various other services such as custom client development and ongoing operation of saas and efiling arrangements in 2016 the software services maintenance and subscriptions gross margin increased 29  compared to the prior year our implementation and support staff has grown by 169  employees since december 31 2015 to support sales growth we began making significant investments in our implementation and support staff in early 2015 since december 31 2014 excluding acquisitions we have added 369 implementation and support employees these additions contributed to the revenue growth in 2016 in addition the nws revenue mix includes a lower proportion of software services compared to tyler’s historical revenue mix which also benefited the gross margin costs related to maintenance and various other services such as saas and efiling typically grow at a slower rate than related revenue due to leverage in the utilization of support and maintenance staff and economies of scale maintenance and subscription price increases also resulted in slightly higher gross margins 

appraisal services  appraisal services revenue comprised approximately 35  of total revenue the appraisal services gross margin increased 11  compared to 2015 a high proportion of the costs of appraisal services revenue are variable as we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects whose term of employment generally ends with the projects’ completion 

our 2016 blended gross margin remained consistent compared to 2015 our overall gross margin was positively impacted by improved utilization of our support and maintenance staff however this benefit was offset by amortization expense for acquired software related to the nws acquisition 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses consist primarily of salaries employee benefits travel sharebased compensation expense commissions and related overhead costs for administrative and sales and marketing employees as well as professional fees trade show activities advertising costs and other marketing related costs the following table sets forth a comparison of our sga expenses for the following years ended december 31 



sga as a percentage of revenue was 221  in 2016  compared to 226  in 2015  in 2015 our sga expense included approximately 59 million for financial advisory legal accounting due diligence valuation and other various expenses necessary to complete the nws acquisition excluding nws transaction costs and sga from acquisitions sga expense increased approximately 12 mainly due to compensation costs related to increased staff levels higher stock compensation expense and increased commission expense as a result of higher sales we have added 22  employees mainly to our sales and finance teams since december 31 2015 in addition our 2016 stock compensation expense rose 64 million mainly due to increases in our stock price over the last few years 

research and development expense 

research and development expense consists primarily of salaries employee benefits and related overhead costs associated with product development the following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the years ended december 31 



research and development expense consists mainly of costs associated with development of new products and technologies from which we do not currently generate revenue as well as costs related to the ongoing development efforts for microsoft dynamics ax our contractual research and development commitment to develop public sector functionality for microsoft dynamics ax was amended in march 2016 which significantly reduced our development commitment through march 2018 however we will continue to provide sustained engineering and technical support for the public sector functionality within dynamics ax license and maintenance royalties for all applicable domestic and international sales of dynamics ax to public sector entities will continue under the terms of the contract 

excluding the results of acquisitions research and development expense increased 15 in 2016 compared to the prior year period mainly due to research and development efforts related to new tyler product development initiatives as a result of the microsoft dynamics ax amendment we also redeployed certain development resources to enhance functionality on several existing solutions and these costs were recorded in cost of sales – software services maintenance and subscriptions 

amortization of customer and trade name intangibles 

acquisition intangibles are comprised of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that is allocated to acquired software leases and customer and trade name intangibles the remaining excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues while amortization expense of customer and trade name intangibles is recorded as operating expense the estimated useful lives of both customer and trade name intangibles range from five to 25 years the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the years ended december 31 



amortization of customer and trade name intangibles increased substantially from the comparable prior year periods due to the acquisition of nws in november 2015 

estimated annual amortization expense relating to customer and trade name acquisition intangibles excluding acquired software for which the amortization expense is recorded as cost of revenues for the next five years and thereafter is as follows in thousands 



amortization expense relating to acquired leases will be recorded as a reduction to hardware and other revenue and is expected to be 442000  in 2017  426000  in 2018  373000  in 2019  314000  in 2020  312000  in 2021  and 13 million  thereafter  

other 

the following table sets forth a comparison of other expense income net for the years ended december 31 



other expense income is comprised of interest expense and nonusage and other fees associated with our revolving credit agreement as well as interest income from invested cash in 2015 we had significantly higher invested cash balances and no outstanding debt until we completed the nws acquisition on november 16 2015 

income tax provision 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the years ended december 31 



the decrease in the income tax provision during 2016 was primarily driven by the adoption of asu no 201609 which requires the excess tax benefits from stock option exercises to be recognized as a reduction of the income tax provision whereas they previously were accounted for as an increase to shareholders’ equity the adoption of asu no 201609 resulted in a 296 million  decrease in our full year 2016 provision for income taxes see note 1  summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

excluding the impact of the adoption of asu no 201609 our income tax provision and effective tax rate in 2016 would have been 490 million and 379 respectively 

the effective income tax rates in both 2016 and 2015 also differed from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of 35 due to state income taxes the domestic production activities deduction nondeductible sharebased compensation expense disqualifying incentive stock option dispositions and nondeductible business expenses we realized a lower domestic production activities deduction as a result of taxable income limitations and nondeductible transaction costs related to the nws acquisition negatively impacted our 2015 effective tax rate in the past few years a relatively high amount of excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises have resulted in a reduction in our qualified manufacturing activities deduction the qualified manufacturing activities deduction can be limited to a certain level of taxable income on the tax return therefore any significant items that reduce taxable income such as excess tax benefits on stock options can reduce the amount of the qualified manufacturing activities deduction we experienced significant stock option exercise activity in 2016 and 2015 that generated excess tax benefits of 296 million  and 453 million respectively 

2015 compared to 2014 

revenues 

software licenses and royalties 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software licenses and royalties revenue for the years ended december 31 



excluding the results of acquisitions software license revenue increased 15 compared to the prior year the majority of this growth was due to a more active marketplace as the result of improvement in local government economic conditions as well as our increasingly strong competitive position which we attribute in part to our investment in product development in recent years in addition addon sales to our existing customer base for courts and justice related solutions that assist and support the transition to a paperless environment increased approximately 13 million 

our new client mix in 2015 was approximately 76 selecting perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 24 selecting subscriptionbased arrangements compared to a client mix in 2014 of approximately 74 selecting perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 26 selecting subscriptionbased arrangements 134 new clients entered into subscriptionbased software arrangements in 2015 compared to 138 new clients in 2014 

subscriptions 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our subscriptions revenue for the years ended december 31 



subscriptionbased services revenue increased 27 compared to 2014 efiling services contributed approximately 77 million of the subscriptions revenue increase in 2015 most of the efiling revenue increase related to several statewide contracts several of which implemented mandatory electronic filing near the end of 2014 and throughout 2015 new saas clients as well as existing clients who converted to our saas model provided the remainder of the subscriptions revenue increase in 2015 we added 134 new saas clients and 66 existing clients elected to convert to our saas model the average contract sizes in 2015 were 38 and 22 higher than 2014 for new clients and clients converting to our saas model respectively 

software services 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software services revenue for the years ended december 31 



excluding the results of acquisitions software services revenue grew 20 compared to the prior year period this growth is mainly due to much higher revenue from proprietary software arrangements as well as additions to our implementation and support staff which increased our capacity to deliver backlog 

maintenance 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our maintenance revenue for the years ended december 31 



excluding the results of acquisitions maintenance revenue grew 12 compared to the prior year maintenance and support revenue increased mainly due to growth in our installed customer base from new software license sales as well as annual maintenance rate increases 

appraisal services 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our appraisal services revenue for the years ended december 31 



appraisal services revenue benefited from the addition of several new revaluation contracts including the city of detroit and the current appraisal cycle in indiana both of which began in 2014 in late 2015 franklin county ohio began a full reappraisal cycle which also contributed to appraisal services revenue 

cost of revenues and gross margins 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues for the years ended december 31 



the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the years ended december 31 



software licenses royalties and acquired software  in 2015 our software licenses royalties and acquired software gross margin percentage declined compared to the prior year due to much higher amortization expense for acquired software resulting from our acquisition of nws excluding the results of nws our software license royalties and acquired software gross margin was 936 which increased 13 from the prior year period mainly due to higher revenues from proprietary software arrangements 

software services maintenance and subscriptions  in 2015 the software services maintenance and subscriptions gross margin percentage declined compared to the prior year mainly due to onboarding costs associated with accelerated hiring to ensure that we are wellpositioned to deliver our current backlog and anticipated new business excluding 285 employees added with acquisitions our implementation and support staff has grown by 200 employees since december 31 2014 in addition in 2015 we incurred 14 million more in contract labor cost than 2014 in an effort to maintain flexibility to accommodate fluctuations in demand for professional services the gross margin decline was somewhat offset because costs related to maintenance and various other services such as saas and efiling typically grow at a slower rate than related revenue due to leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale price increases also resulted in slightly higher rates on certain services 

appraisal services  appraisal services revenue comprised approximately 4 of total revenue the appraisal services gross margin increased 2 compared to 2014 a high proportion of the costs of appraisal services revenue are variable as we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects whose term of employment generally ends with the projects’ completion the appraisal services gross margin was favorably impacted by operational efficiencies associated with a large revaluation contract that began late 2014 

our 2015 blended gross margin declined 04 compared to 2014 the gross margin was negatively impacted by increased acquired software amortization expense associated with the nws acquisition and expenses associated with increased hiring of implementation and development staff in order to expand our capacity to implement our contract backlog 

selling general and administrative expenses 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our sga expenses for the following years ended december 31 



sga as a percentage of revenue was 226 in 2015 compared to 220 in 2014 in 2015 our sga expenses include approximately 59 million for financial advisory legal accounting due diligence valuation and other various services necessary to complete the nws acquisition in addition our 2015 operating results include 40 million of sga expenses for nws from the date of acquisition the remaining sga expense increase is mainly due to compensation cost related to increased staff levels higher stock compensation expense and increased commission expense as a result of higher sales excluding 140 employees added with acquisitions we have added 16 employees mainly to our sales and finance teams since december 31 2014 in addition our 2015 stock compensation expense rose 42 million mainly due to increases in our stock price over the last few years   

research and development expense 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the years ended december 31 



research and development expense in 2015 includes approximately 15 million related to nws the remaining increase compared to 2014 was primarily due to increased staffing to maintain and enhance our competitive position and annual wage adjustments 

amortization of customer and trade name intangibles 

the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the years ended december 31 



in 2015 we completed two acquisitions that increased amortizable customer and trade name intangibles by approximately 1278 million this amount is being amortized over a weighted average period of 15 years we also added approximately 37 million to acquisition related intangibles to reflect the fair value of acquired leases which will be amortized over the weighted average life of 9 years 

other 

the following table sets forth a comparison of other income expense net for the years ended december 31 



expenses in 2014 were comprised primarily of nonusage and other fees associated with a revolving debt agreement that terminated in august 2014 offset slightly by interest income from invested cash in 2015 we had significantly higher invested cash balances than 2014 until we completed the nws acquisition on november 16 2015 

income tax provision 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the years ended december 31 



the effective income tax rates were different from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of 35 principally due to state income taxes nondeductible sharebased compensation expense the qualified manufacturing activities deduction disqualifying incentive stock option dispositions nondeductible meals and entertainment costs and nondeductible transaction costs a lower qualified manufacturing activities deduction and nondeductible transaction costs related to the nws acquisition negatively impacted our 2015 effective tax rate 

in the past few years a relatively high amount of excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises have resulted in a reduction in our qualified manufacturing activities deduction as a result of taxable income limitations we experienced significant stock option exercise activity in 2015 and 2014 that generated excess tax benefits of 453 million and 194 million respectively 

financial condition and liquidity 

as of december 31 2016  we had cash and cash equivalents of 362 million  compared to 331 million  at december 31 2015  we also had 335 million  invested in investment grade corporate and municipal bonds as of december 31 2016  these investments mature between 2016 through mid2018  and we intend to hold these investments until maturity cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with several domestic banks and money market funds as of december 31 2016  we had 100 million  in outstanding borrowings and two outstanding letters of credit totaling 22 million  in connection with a client contract and the expansion of our yarmouth facility both letters of credit guarantee our performance under each contract we do not believe the letters of credit will be required to be drawn upon both letters of credit expire in 2017  we believe our revolving line of credit cash from operating activities cash on hand and access to the credit markets provide us with sufficient flexibility to meet our longterm financial needs 

the following table sets forth a summary of cash flows for the years ended december 31 



net cash provided by operating activities continues to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures other potential capital resources include cash on hand public and private issuances of debt or equity securities and bank borrowings it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets in the future may be limited by economic conditions or other factors we currently believe that cash provided by operating activities cash on hand and available credit are 

sufficient to fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures income tax obligations and share repurchases for at least the next twelve months 

in 2016  operating activities provided cash of 1919 million  operating activities that provided cash were primarily comprised of net income of 1099 million  noncash depreciation and amortization charges of 503 million  and noncash sharebased compensation expense of 297 million  other sources of operating cash were higher deferred revenue balances due to growth in our installed software maintenance customer base and growth in subscriptionbased arrangements and timing of payments for wages and commissions somewhat offsetting these increases were annual maintenance and subscription billings 

in general changes in the balance of deferred revenue are cyclical and primarily driven by the timing of our maintenance renewal billings our renewal dates occur throughout the year but our largest renewal cycles occur in the second and fourth quarters 

days sales outstanding in accounts receivable were 93  days at december 31 2016  compared to 100  days at december 31 2015  our maintenance billing cycle typically peaks at its highest level in june and second highest level in december of each year and is followed by collections in the subsequent quarter dso is calculated based on quarterend accounts receivable excluding longterm receivables but including unbilled receivables divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by 360 days 

investing activities used cash of 507 million  in 2016  compared to 3985 million  in 2015  we invested 203 million  in investment grade corporate and municipal bonds with maturity dates ranging from 2016 through mid2018  approximately 377 million  was invested in property and equipment we purchased an office building in falmouth maine that was previously leased from an entity owned by an executive’s father and brother for approximately 97 million and paid 80 million for construction to expand a building in yarmouth maine we plan to spend approximately 187 million in 2017 in connection with the completion of this office expansion the remaining additions were for computer equipment furniture and fixtures in support of internal growth particularly with respect to growth in our cloudbased offerings we also made a small acquisition for approximately 74 million and paid 20 million related to the working capital holdback in connection with the nws acquisition these expenditures were funded from cash generated from operations cash on hand and bank borrowings 

in 2015 we completed the acquisition of nws for the purchase price of 3375 million in cash of which 40 million was accrued at december 31 2015 and 21 million shares of tyler common stock valued at 3628 million also we completed the acquisition of brazos technology corporation for the purchase price net of cash acquired and including debt assumed of 61 million in cash and 12500 shares of tyler common stock valued at 15 million on january 30 2015 we made a 150 million investment in convertible preferred stock representing a 20 interest in record holdings pty limited we also invested 309 million in investment grade corporate and municipal bonds the remaining use of cash was for capital expenditures related to computer equipment furniture and fixtures in support of internal growth particularly with respect to growth in our cloudbased offerings 

financing activities used cash of 1381 million  in 2016  compared to cash provided by financing activities of 911 million  in 2015  financing activities in 2016 were comprised of 560 million  net payments on our revolving line of credit offset somewhat by collections of 298 million  from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan activity we also purchased approximately 882000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 1127 million  of which 860000 was accrued at december 31 2016 

financing activities in 2015 were comprised of net borrowings of 660 million and collections of 278 million from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan activity we purchased approximately 5400 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 645000 in 2015 and paid 21 million in debt issuance costs cash used by financing activities in 2014 were comprised of purchases of 294000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 228 million offset substantially by collections of 188 million from stock option exercises and contributions from the employee stock purchase plan 

on may 11 2016 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 15 million shares of tyler common stock the repurchase program which was approved by our board of directors was announced in october 2002 and was amended at various times from 2003 through 2016 as of december 31 2016  we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to 20 million  additional shares of our common stock our share repurchase program allows us to repurchase shares at our discretion market conditions influence the timing of the buybacks and the number of shares repurchased as well as the volume of employee stock option exercises share repurchases are generally funded using our existing cash balances and borrowings under our credit facility and may occur through open market purchases and transactions structured through investment banking institutions privately negotiated transactions andor other mechanisms there is no expiration date specified for the authorization and we intend to repurchase stock under the plan from time to time 

subsequent to december 31 2016  and through february 21 2017 we purchased approximately 42000  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cash purchase price of 62 million  

on november 16 2015  we entered into a 3000 million  credit agreement the “credit facility” with the various lenders party thereto and wells fargo bank national association as administrative agent the credit facility provides for a revolving credit line 

of up to  3000 million  including a 100 million  sublimit for letters of credit the credit facility matures on november 16 2020  borrowings under the credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes including working capital requirements acquisitions and share repurchases borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a rate of either 1 wells fargo bank’s prime rate subject to certain higher rate determinations plus a margin of 025  to 100  or 2 the 30 60 90 or 180 day libor rate plus a margin of 125  to 200  as of december 31 2016  our interest rate was 196  the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets the credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial conditions and prohibits us from making certain investments advances cash dividends or loans and limits incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens as of december 31 2016  we were in compliance with those covenants  

  

as of december 31 2016  we had 100 million  in outstanding borrowings and unused borrowing capacity of 2878 million  under the credit facility  

we paid income taxes net of refunds received of 302 million  in 2016  273 million  in 2015  and 102 million  in 2014  in 2016 we experienced significant stock option exercise activity that generated net tax benefits of 296 million  and reduced tax payments accordingly in 2015 and 2014 excess tax benefits were 453 million and 194 million respectively 

excluding acquisitions we anticipate that 2017 capital spending will be between 520 million and 540 million including approximately 240 million related to real estate we expect the majority of the other capital spending will consist of computer equipment and software for infrastructure replacements and expansion we currently do not expect to capitalize significant amounts related to software development in 2017 but the actual amount and timing of those costs and whether they are capitalized or expensed may result in additional capitalized software development capital spending is expected to be funded from existing cash balances cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving line of credit 

from time to time we engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates in order to pursue such opportunities which could require significant commitments of capital we may be required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive securities in the future no assurance can be given as to our future acquisition opportunities and how such opportunities will be financed 

we lease office facilities as well as transportation computer and other equipment used in our operations under noncancelable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through 2023 most leases contain renewal options and some contain purchase options 

summarized in the table below are our obligations to make future payments under our credit facility and lease obligations at december 31 2016  in thousands 



as of december 31 2016  we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements guarantees to thirdparties or material purchase commitments except for the operating lease commitments listed above 

capitalization 

at december 31 2016  our capitalization consisted of 100 million  of outstanding borrowings and 9155 million  of shareholders’ equity

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial market prices and interest rates 

as of december 31 2016  we had 100 million  in outstanding borrowings under the credit facility loans under the credit facility bear interest at tyler’s option at a per annum rate of either 1 the wells fargo bank prime rate subject to certain higher rate determinations plus a margin of 025 to 100 or 2 the 30 60 90 or 180day libor rate plus a margin of 125 to 200 

in 2016  our effective average interest rate for borrowings was 179  as of december 31 2016  our interest rate was 196  the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 

assuming borrowings of 100 million  a hypothetical 10 increase in our interest rate at december 31 2016  for a oneyear period would result in approximately 19600  of additional interest rate expense

tyler was founded in 1966 prior to 1998 we operated as a diversified industrial conglomerate with operations in various industrial retail and distribution businesses all of which have been divested in 1997 we embarked on a multiphase growth plan focused on serving the specialized information management needs of local governments nationwide we entered the local government it market through a series of strategic acquisitions in 1998 and 1999 

market overview 

the state and local government market is one of the largest and most decentralized it markets in the country consisting of all 50 states approximately 3000 counties 36000 cities and towns and 13900 school districts this market is also comprised of approximately 37000 special districts and other agencies each with specialized delegated responsibilities and unique information management requirements 

traditionally local government bodies and agencies performed statemandated duties including property assessment record keeping road maintenance law enforcement administration of election and judicial functions and the provision of welfare assistance today a host of emerging and urgent issues are confronting local governments each of which demands a service response these areas include criminal justice and corrections administration and finance public safety health and human services planning regulatory and maintenance and records and document management transfers of responsibility from the federal and state governments to county and municipal governments and agencies in these and other areas also place additional service and financial requirements on these local government units in addition constituents of local governments are increasingly demanding improved service and better access to information from public entities as a result local governments recognize the increasing value of information management systems and services to among other things improve revenue collection provide increased access to information and streamline delivery of services to their constituents local government bodies are now recognizing that “egovernment” is an additional responsibility for community development from integrated tax systems to integrated civil and criminal justice information systems many counties and cities have benefited significantly from the implementation of jurisdictionwide systems that allow different agencies or government offices to share data and provide a more comprehensive approach to information management many city and county governmental agencies also have unique individual information management requirements which must be tailored to the specific functions of each particular office 

many local governments also have difficulties attracting and retaining the staff necessary to support their it functions as a result they seek to establish longterm relationships with reliable providers of high quality it products and services such as tyler 

although local governments generally face budgetary constraints in their operations their primary revenue sources are usually property taxes and to a lesser extent utility billings and other fees which historically tend to be relatively stable in addition the acquisition of new technology typically enables local governments to operate more efficiently and often provides a measurable return on investment that justifies the purchase of software and related services 

gartner inc a leading information technology research and advisory company estimates that state and local government application and vertical specific software spending will grow from 116 billion in 2016 to 140 billion in 2019 the professional services and support segments of the market are expected to expand from 324 billion in 2016 to 356 billion in 2019 application and vertical 

 

 

specific software sales in the primary and secondary education segment s of the market is expected to expand from 21 billion in 2016 to 26 billion in 2019 while professional services and support are expected to grow from 23 billion in 2016 to 26 billion in 2019 

products and services 

we provide a comprehensive and flexible suite of products and services that addresses the information technology needs of cities counties schools and other local government entities we derive our revenues from five primary sources 

• sales of software licenses and royalties 

• subscr iptionbased arrangements 

• software services 

• maintenance and support and 

• appraisal services 

we design develop market and support a broad range of software solutions to serve missioncritical “backoffice” functions of local governments many of our software applications include internetaccessible solutions that allow for realtime public access to a variety of information or that allow the public to transact business with local governments via the internet our software solutions and services are generally grouped in six major areas 

• financial management and education 

• courts and justice

each of our core software systems consists of several fully integrated applications for clients who acquire software for use inhouse we generally license our systems under standard perpetual license agreements that provide the client with a fully paid nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software in some of the product areas such as financial management and education and property appraisal and tax we offer multiple solutions designed to meet the needs of different sized governments 

we also offer saas arrangements which utilize the tyler private cloud for clients who do not wish to maintain update and operate these systems or to make upfront capital expenditures to implement these advanced technologies for these clients we deliver our software using the saas model — the software and client data are hosted at our data centers or at thirdparty locations and clients typically sign multiyear contracts for these subscriptionbased services 

historically we have had a greater proportion of our annual revenues in the second half of our fiscal year due to governmental budget and spending cycles and the timing of system implementations for clients desiring to “go live” at the beginning of the calendar year

subscriptionbased services 

subscriptionbased revenue is primarily derived from our saas arrangements which utilize the tyler private cloud as well as our transaction based offerings such as efiling solutions 

we are able to provide the majority of our software products through our saas model the clients who choose this model typically do not wish to maintain update and operate these systems or make upfront capital expenditures to implement these advanced technologies the contract terms for these arrangements range from one to 10 years but are typically contracted for initial periods of three to seven years the majority of our saas or hosting arrangements include additional professional services as well as maintenance and support services in certain arrangements the client may also acquire a license to the software 

as part of our subscriptionbased services we provide efiling solutions that simplify the filing and management of court related documents for courts and law offices revenues for efiling are included in subscriptionbased revenues and are derived from transaction fees and in some cases fixed fee arrangements

software services 

we provide a variety of professional it services to clients who utilize our software products virtually all of our clients contract with us for installation training and data conversion services in connection with their purchase of tyler’s software solutions the complete implementation process for a typical system includes planning design data conversion setup and testing at the culmination of the implementation process an installation team travels to the client’s facility to ensure the smooth transfer of data to the new system installation fees are charged separately to clients on either a fixedfee or hourly charge basis depending on the contract 

both in connection with the installation of new systems and on an ongoing basis we provide extensive training services and programs related to our products and services training can be provided in our training centers onsite at clients’ locations or at meetings and conferences and can be customized to meet clients’ requirements the vast majority of our clients contract with us for training services both to improve their employees’ proficiency and productivity and to fully utilize the functionality of our systems training services are generally billed on an hourly or daily basis along with travel and other expenses 

maintenance and support 

following the implementation of our software systems we provide ongoing software support services to assist our clients in operating the systems and to periodically update the software support is provided to clients over the phone or via the web through help desks 

 

 

staffed by our client support representatives for more complicated issue s our staff with the client’s permission can log on to clients’ systems remotely we maintain our clients’ software largely through releases that contain improvements and incremental additions of features and functionality along with updates necessary because of legislative or regulatory changes 

virtually all of our software clients contract with us for maintenance and support which provides us with a significant source of recurring revenue we generally provide maintenance and support for our onpremises clients under annual or in some cases multiyear contracts with a typical fee based on a percentage of the software product’s license fee these fees can generally be increased on renewal and may also increase as new license fees increase maintenance and support fees are generally paid annually in advance most maintenance contracts automatically renew unless the client or tyler gives notice of termination prior to expiration similar support is provided to our saas clients and is included in their subscription fees which are classified as subscriptionbased revenues 

appraisal services 

we are the nation’s largest provider of property appraisal outsourcing services for local government taxing authorities these services include 

• the physical inspection of commercial and residential properties 

• data collection and processing 

• sophisticated computer analyses for property valuation 

• preparation of tax rolls 

• community education regarding the assessment process and 

• arbitration betw een taxpayers and the assessing jurisdiction 

local government taxing authorities normally reappraise properties from time to time to update values for tax assessment purposes and to maintain equity in the taxing process in some jurisdictions law mandates reassessment cycles in others they are discretionary while some taxing jurisdictions perform reappraisals inhouse many local governments outsource this function because of its cyclical nature and because of the specialized knowledge and expertise requirements associated with it our appraisal services business unit has been in this business since 1938 

in some instances we also sell property tax andor appraisal software products in connection with appraisal outsourcing projects while other clients may only engage us to provide appraisal services appraisal outsourcing services are somewhat seasonal in nature to the extent that winter weather conditions reduce the productivity of data collection activities in connection with those projects 

strategy 

our objective is to grow our revenue and earnings organically supplemented by focused strategic acquisitions the key components of our business strategy are to 

• provide high quality value–added products and services to our clients  we compete on the basis of among other things delivering to clients our deep domain expertise in local government operations through the highest value products and services in the market we believe we have achieved a reputation as a premium product and service provider to the local government market 

• continue to expand our product and service offerings  while we already have what we believe to be the broadest line of software products for local governments we continually upgrade our core software applications and expand our complementary product and service offerings to respond to technological advancements and the changing needs of our clients in 2010 we began providing efiling for courts and law offices which simplifies the filing and management of court related documents we believe revenue from efiling solutions will continue to grow over time as more local and state governments mandate electronic document filings we also offer solutions that allow the public to access data and conduct transactions with local governments such as paying traffic tickets property taxes and utility bills via the internet we believe that the addition of such features enhances the market appeal of our core products we have also broadened our offerings of consulting and business process reengineering services in november 

 

 

2015 we significantly expanded our presence in the public s afety software market through the acquisition of new world systems corporation  

• expand our client base  we seek to establish longterm relationships with new clients primarily through our sales and marketing efforts while we currently have clients in all 50 states canada the caribbean the united kingdom and other international locations not all of our solutions have achieved nationwide geographic penetration we intend to continue to expand into new geographic markets by adding sales staff and targeting marketing efforts by solutions in those areas we also intend to continue to expand our customer base to include more large governments while our traditional market focus has primarily been on small and midsized governments our increased size and market presence together with the technological advances and improved scalability of certain of our solutions are allowing us to achieve increasing success in selling to larger clients we also expect to expand our presence in international markets by leveraging our leadership position in the united states through the disciplined pursuit of selected opportunities in other countries

• expand our existing client relationships  our existing customer base offers significant opportunities for additional sales of solutions and services that we currently offer but that existing clients do not fully utilize addon sales to existing clients typically involve lower sales and marketing expenses than sales to new clients 

• grow recurring revenues  we have a large recurring revenue base from maintenance and support and subscriptionbased services which generated revenues of 3575 million or 60 of total revenues in 2015 we have historically experienced very low customer turnover approximately 3 annually and recurring revenues continue to grow as the installed customer base increases in addition subscriptionbased revenues have been our fastest growing revenue category over the past five years increasing from 312 million in 2011 to 1119 million in 2015 

• maximize economies of scale and take advantage of financial leverage in our business  we seek to build and maintain a large client base to create economies of scale enabling us to provide valueadded products and services to our clients while expanding our operating margins because we sell primarily “offtheshelf” software increased sales of the same solutions result in incrementally higher gross margins in addition we believe that we have a marketing and administrative infrastructure in place that can be leveraged to accommodate significant longterm growth without proportionately increasing selling general and administrative expenses 

• attract and retain highly qualified employees  we believe that the depth and quality of our operations management and staff is one of our significant strengths and that the ability to retain such employees is crucial to our continued growth and success we believe that our stable management team financial strength and growth opportunities as well as our leadership position in the local government market enhance our attractiveness as an employer for highly skilled employees 

• pursue selected strategic acquisitions  while we expect to primarily grow internally from time to time we selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that provide us with one or more of the following 

• new products and services to complement our existing offerings 

• entry into new markets related to local governments and 

• new clients andor geographic expansion 

• establish strategic alliances  in january 2007 we announced a strategic alliance with microsoft corporation to jointly develop core public sector functionality for microsoft dynamics ax to address the unique accounting needs of public sector organizations worldwide as part of this alliance we are enhancing microsoft dynamics ax with public sectorspecific functionality the arrangement has broadened the functionality of microsoft dynamics ax providing both tyler and microsoft with a public sector accounting platform to support their existing and prospective clients well into the future microsoft dynamics ax with public sector functionality was released to the market in august 2011 and is being sold in the united states and internationally through microsoft’s distribution channels tyler is also an authorized microsoft reseller for the microsoft dynamics solutions developed under this arrangement and we are selling the solutions directly into the government market tyler receives license and maintenance royalties on direct and indirect publicsector sales worldwide of the solutions codeveloped under this multiyear term relationship 

our contractual research and development commitment to develop public sector functionality for microsoft dynamics ax expires with the release of dynamics ax 7 which is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2016 we are currently discussing with microsoft corporation the possibility of additional research and development beyond dynamics ax 7 if we cannot agree to terms of any future 

 

 

commitments we will continue to provide sustained engineering and technical support for the public sector functionality within dynamics ax license and maintenance royalties for all applicable domestic and international sales of dynamics ax to public sector entities will continue under the terms of the contract 

sales marketing and clients 

we market our products and services through direct sales and marketing personnel located throughout the united states other inhouse sales staff focus on addon sales professional services and support 

sales of new systems are typically generated from referrals from other government offices or departments within a county or municipality referrals from other local governments relationships established between sales representatives and county or local officials contacts at trade shows direct mailings and direct contact from prospects already familiar with us we are active in numerous national state county and local government associations and participate in annual meetings trade shows and educational events 

clients consist primarily of county and municipal agencies school districts and other local government offices in counties clients include the auditor treasurer tax assessorcollector county clerk district clerk county and district court judges probation officers sheriff and county appraiser at municipal government sites clients include directors from various departments including administration finance utilities public works code enforcement personnel purchasing taxation municipal court and police contracts for software products and services are generally implemented over periods of three months to one year although some complex implementations may span multiple years with annually renewing maintenance and support update agreements thereafter although either the client or we can terminate these agreements historically almost all support and maintenance agreements are automatically renewed annually contracts for appraisal outsourcing services are generally one to three years in duration during 2015 approximately 42 of our revenue was attributable to ongoing support and maintenance agreements

competition 

we compete with numerous local regional and national firms that provide or offer some or many of the same solutions and services that we provide many of these competitors are smaller companies that may be able to offer less expensive solutions than ours many of these firms operate within a specific geographic area andor in a narrow product or service niche we also compete with national firms some of which have greater financial and technical resources than we do including oracle corporation infor lawson sap ag fis sungard thomson reuters corporation and constellation software inc in addition we sometimes compete with consulting and systems integration firms which develop custom systems primarily for larger governments we also occasionally compete with central internal information service departments of local governments which requires us to persuade the enduser department to discontinue service by its own personnel and outsource the service to us 

we compete on a variety of factors including price service name recognition reputation technological capabilities and the ability to modify existing products and services to accommodate the individual requirements of the client our ability to offer an integrated system of applications for several offices or departments is often a competitive advantage local governmental units often are required to seek competitive proposals through a request for proposal process and some prospective clients use consultants to assist them with the proposal and vendor selection process 

suppliers 

substantially all of the computers peripherals printers scanners operating system software office automation software and other equipment necessary for the implementation and provision of our software systems and services are presently available from several thirdparty sources hardware is purchased on original equipment manufacturer or distributor terms at discounts from retail we have not experienced any significant supply problems 

backlog 

at december 31 2015 our estimated revenue backlog was approximately 8445 million compared to 7020 million at december 31 2014 the backlog represents signed contracts under which the revenue has not been recognized as of yearend approximately 4763 million or 56 of the backlog is expected to be recognized during 2016

 

 

intellectual property proprietary rights and licenses 

we regard certain features of our internal operations software and documentation as confidential and proprietary and rely on a combination of contractual restrictions trade secret laws and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property we generally do not rely on patents we believe that due to the rapid rate of technological change in the computer software industry trade secrets and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as knowledge ability and experience of our employees frequent product enhancements and timeliness and quality of support services we typically license our software products under nonexclusive license agreements which are generally nontransferable and have a perpetual term 

employees 

at december 31 2015 we had 3586 employees appraisal outsourcing projects are cyclical in nature and can be widely dispersed geographically we often hire temporary employees to assist in these projects whose term of employment generally ends with the project’s completion none of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to collective bargaining agreements we consider our relations with our employees to be positive 

internet website and availability of public filings 

we file annual quarterly current and other reports proxy statements and other information with the securities and exchange commission or sec pursuant to the securities exchange act you may read and copy any materials we file with the sec at the sec’s public reference room by calling the sec at 18007320330 the sec maintains an internet site that contains reports proxy and other information statements and other information regarding issuers including us that file electronically with the sec the address of this site is httpwwwsecgov

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk investors evaluating our company should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this annual report any of the following factors could materially harm our business operating results and financial condition additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business operating results and financial condition this section should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report we may make forwardlooking statements from time to time both written and oral we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forwardlooking statements our actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forwardlooking statements due to a number of factors including those set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report 

risks associated with our software products 

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities can disrupt our business and harm our competitive position 

threats to it security can take a variety of forms individuals and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations including statesponsored organizations may take steps that pose threats to our clients and our it they may develop and deploy malicious software to attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and data centers or act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks cyber threats are constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and clients breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications impair our ability to provide services to our clients and protect the privacy of their data result in product development delays compromise confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets require us to allocate more resources to 

 

 

improve technologies or otherwise adversely affect our business our business policies and internal secu rity controls may not keep pace with these evolving threats 

we cannot fully protect client information from security breaches 

as we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloudbased offerings we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable and other confidential information of our clients the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security despite our efforts to improve security controls it is possible our security controls over personal data our training of employees on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of client data that we store and manage improper disclosure could harm our reputation lead to legal exposure to clients or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 

hosting services for some of our products are dependent upon the uninterrupted operation of data centers 

a material portion of our business is provided through software hosting services these hosting services depend on the uninterrupted operation of data centers and the ability to protect computer equipment and information stored in these data centers against damage that may be caused by natural disaster fire power loss telecommunications or internet failure acts of terrorism unauthorized intrusion computer viruses and other similar damaging events if any of our data centers were to become inoperable for an extended period we might be unable to fulfill our contractual commitments although we take what we believe to be reasonable precautions against such occurrences we can give no assurance that damaging events such as these will not result in a prolonged interruption of our services which could result in client dissatisfaction loss of revenue and damage to our business 

we run the risk of errors or defects with new products or enhancements to existing products 

our software products are complex and may contain errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released although we have not experienced material adverse effects from any such defects or errors to date we cannot assure you that material defects and errors will not be found in the future any such defects could result in a loss of revenues or delay market acceptance our license agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability however it is possible we may not always successfully negotiate such provisions in our client contracts or the limitation of liability provisions may not be effective due to existing or future federal state or local laws ordinances or judicial decisions although we maintain errors and omissions and general liability insurance and we try to structure contracts to limit liability we cannot assure you that a successful claim could not be made or would not have a material adverse effect on our future operating results 

we must timely respond to technological changes to be competitive 

the market for our products is characterized by technological change evolving industry standards in software technology changes in client requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments satisfy increasingly sophisticated client requirements and achieve market acceptance we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and costeffective manner the products capabilities or technologies developed by others could also render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to develop or acquire new software products or develop enhancements to existing products on a timely and costeffective basis or if such new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance

we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights 

many of our product and service offerings incorporate proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of contracts copyrights and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology we cannot be certain that we have taken all appropriate steps to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property there has also been significant litigation recently involving intellectual property rights we are not currently involved in any material intellectual property litigation however we may be a party to such litigation in the future to protect our proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights we cannot assure you that thirdparties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us with respect to current or future products any claims or litigation with or without merit could be timeconsuming costly and a diversion to management any such claims and litigation could also cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements such royalty or licensing arrangements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all therefore litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business regardless of the final outcome of such litigation 

 

 

 

clients may elect to terminate our maint enance contracts and manage operations internally 

it is possible that our clients may elect to not renew maintenance contracts for our software trying instead to maintain and operate the software themselves using their perpetual license rights excluding software applications that we provide on a hosted or cloud basis this could adversely affect our revenues and profits additionally they may inadvertently allow our intellectual property or other information to fall into the hands of thirdparties including our competitors which could adversely affect our business 

material portions of our business require the internet infrastructure to be further developed or adequately maintained 

part of our future success depends on the use of the internet as a means to access public information and perform transactions electronically including for example electronic filing of court documents this in part requires the further development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure among other things this further development and maintenance will require a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed data capacity security and timely development of complementary products for providing reliable internet access and services if this infrastructure fails to be further developed or be adequately maintained our business would be harmed because users may not be able to access our government portals

risks associated with selling products and services into the public sector marketplace 

selling products and services into the public sector poses unique challenges 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of software and services to state county and city governments other municipal agencies and other public entities we expect that sales to public sector clients will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues in the future we face many risks and challenges associated with contracting with governmental entities including 



• long and complex sales cycles 



• political resistance to the concept of contracting with thirdparties to provide it solutions 

• legislative changes affecting local government’s authority to contract with thirdparties 

•varying bid procedures and internal processes for bid acceptance and 

• various other political factors including changes in governmental administrations and personnel 

each of these risks is outside our control if we fail to adequately adapt to these risks and uncertainties our financial performance could be adversely affected 

a prolonged economic slowdown could harm our operations 

a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce demand for our software products and services local and state governments may face financial pressures that could in turn affect our growth rate and profitability in the future there is no assurance that local and state spending levels will be unaffected by declining or stagnant general economic conditions and if budget shortfalls occur they may negatively impact local and state it spending and could adversely affect our business 

a decline in the demand for it may result in a decrease in our revenues or lower our growth rate 

a decline in the demand for it among our current and prospective clients may result in decreased revenues or a lower growth rate because our sales depend in part on our clients’ level of funding for new or additional it systems and services moreover demand for our solutions may be reduced by a decline in overall demand for computer software and services we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase or maintain our revenues 

the open bidding process creates uncertainty in predicting future contract awards 

many governmental agencies purchase products and services through an open bidding process generally a governmental entity will publish an established list of requirements requesting potential vendors to propose solutions for the established requirements to respond successfully to these requests for proposals we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract the time required to establish operations for the proposed client and the likely terms of any other thirdparty proposals submitted we cannot guarantee that we will win any bids in the future through the request for proposal process or that any winning bids will 

 

 

ultimately result in contracts on favorable terms our failure to secure contracts through the open bidding process or to sec ure such contracts on favorable terms may adversely affect our revenue and gross margins 

we face significant competition from other vendors and potential new entrants into our markets 

we believe we are a leading provider of integrated solutions for the public sector however we face competition from a variety of software vendors that offer products and services similar to those offered by us as well as from companies offering to develop custom software we compete based on a number of factors including 

• the attractiveness of our “evergreen” business strategy 

• the breadth depth and quality of our product and service offerings 

• the ability to modify our offerings to accommoda te particular clients’ needs 

• technological innovation 

• name recognition 

• price and 

• our financial strength and stability 

we believe the market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors that vary in size product platform and product scope our competitors include consulting firms publicly held companies that focus on selected segments of the public sector market and a significant number of smaller privately held companies certain competitors have greater technical marketing and financial resources than we do we cannot assure you that such competitors will not develop products or offer services that are superior to our products or services or that achieve greater market acceptance 

we also compete with internal centralized it departments of governmental entities which requires us to persuade the enduser to stop the internal service and outsource to us in addition our clients and prospective clients could elect to provide information management services internally through new or existing departments which could reduce the market for our services 

we could face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the public sector software application market and new products and technologies are introduced increased competition could result in pricing pressure fewer client orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with thirdparties thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective clients it is possible that new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect upon our business 

fixedprice contracts may affect our profits 

some of our contracts are on a fixedpriced basis which can lead to various risks including 

• the failure to accurately estimate t he resources and time required for an engagement 

• the failure to effectively manage our clients’ expectations regarding the scope of services delivered for a fixed fee and 

• the failure to timely and satisfactorily complete fixedprice engagements wit hin budget 

if we do not adequately assess these and other risks we may be subject to cost overruns and penalties which may harm our financial performance

changes in the insurance markets may affect our business 

some of our clients primarily those for our property appraisal services require that we secure performance bonds before they will select us as their vendor in addition we have in the past been required to provide letters of credit as security for the issuance of a performance bond we cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure such performance bonds in the future on terms that are favorable to us if at all our inability to obtain performance bonds on favorable terms or at all could impact our future ability to win some contract awards particularly large property appraisal services contracts which could negatively impact revenues in addition the general insurance markets experience volatility which may lead to future increases in our general and administrative expenses and negatively impact our operating results 

 

 

risks associated with our periodic results and stock price 

software revenue recognition rules may require us to delay revenue recognition into future periods 

we have in the past had to and may in the future be required to defer revenue recognition for software license fees due to several factors including whether 

• license agreements include applications that are under development or other undelivered elements 



• the transaction involves acceptance criteria 

• the transaction invo lves contingent payment terms or fees 

• we are required to accept a fixedfee services contract or 

• we are required to provide extended payment terms 

because of these factors and other specific requirements for software revenue recognition under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states we must have very precise terms in our contracts to recognize revenue upon the delivery and installation of our software or performance of services negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions may extend the sales cycle we are not always able to negotiate terms and conditions that permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery or even upon project completion 

fluctuations in quarterly revenue could adversely impact our operating results and stock price 

our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter for a variety of reasons including the following 

• prospective clients’ contracting decisions are often made in the last few weeks of a quarter 

• the size of license transactions can vary significantly 







• we may have to defer revenues under our revenue recognition policies and 



in each fiscal quarter our expense levels operating costs and hiring plans are based to some extent on projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed if our actual revenues fall below expectations we could experience a reduction in operating results also if actual revenues or earnings for any given quarter fall below expectations it may lead to a decline in our stock price 

increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins 

we realize lower margins on software and appraisal service revenues than on license revenue the majority of our contracts include both software licenses and software services therefore an increase in the percentage of software service and appraisal service revenue compared to license revenue could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and could adversely affect operating results 

our stock price may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile examples of factors that may significantly impact our stock price include 

• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results 

 

 

• announcements of technological innovations new products or new contracts by us or our competitors  

• developments with respect to p atents copyrights or other proprietary rights 

• conditions and trends in the software and other technology industries 

• adoption of new accounting standards affecting the software industry 

• changes in financial estimates by securities analysts an d 

• general market conditions and other factors 

in addition the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of technology company stocks and may in the future adversely affect the market price of our stock sometimes securities class action litigation is filed following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities we cannot assure you that similar litigation will not occur in the future with respect to us such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect upon our financial performance 

financial outlook 

from time to time in press releases and otherwise we may publish forecasts or other forwardlooking statements regarding our results including estimated revenues or earnings any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties and as a matter of course any number of them may prove to be incorrect further the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors including those described in this discussion many of which are beyond our control as a result we cannot be certain that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse current and potential stockholders are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions but instead are encouraged to utilize our entire publicly available mix of historical and forwardlooking information as well as other available information regarding us our products and services and the software industry when evaluating our prospective results of operations 

risks associated with our growth strategy and other general corporate risks 

we may experience difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy 

a material portion of our historical growth has resulted from strategic acquisitions although our focus is on internal growth we will continue to identify and pursue strategic acquisitions with suitable candidates these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including the transaction does not advance our business strategy we get no satisfactory return on our investment we have difficulty integrating business systems and technology we have difficulty retaining or integrating new employees the transactions distract management from our other businesses we acquire unforeseen liabilities and other unanticipated events our future success will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate future acquisitions into our operations it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits of these transactions such as increased revenue enhanced efficiencies or increased market share or the benefits may be ultimately smaller than we expected although we conduct due diligence reviews of potential acquisition candidates we may not identify all material liabilities or risks related to acquisition candidates there can be no assurance that any such strategic acquisitions will be accomplished on favorable terms or will result in profitable operations 

our failure to properly manage growth could adversely affect our business 

we have expanded our operations significantly since 1998 when we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector we intend to continue expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities this growth places a significant demand on management and operational resources in order to manage growth effectively we must implement and improve our operational systems procedures and controls on a timely basis if we fail to implement these systems our business may be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to hire integrate and retain qualified personnel 

our continued success will depend upon the availability and performance of our key management sales marketing client support and product development personnel the loss of key management or technical personnel could adversely affect us we believe that our continued success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract integrate and retain such personnel we have at times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel competition for qualified software development sales and other personnel is intense and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

 

 

compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance may result in additional expenses 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure can create uncertainty for public companies the costs required to comply with such evolving laws are difficult to predict to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards this investment may result in an unforeseen increase in general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenuegenerating activities which may harm our operating results 

we don’t foresee paying dividends on our common stock 

we have not declared or paid a cash dividend since we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector in 1998 we intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law could deter takeover attempts 

our board of directors may issue up to 1000000 shares of preferred stock and may determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting and conversion rights of these preferred shares these determinations may be made without any further vote or action by our stockholders the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock in addition some provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and the delaware general corporation law could also delay prevent or make more difficult a merger tender offer or proxy contest involving us

new accounting pronouncements 

on may 28 2014 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” this asu is the result of a convergence project between the fasb and the international accounting standards board the core principle behind asu 201409 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for delivering those goods and services this model involves a fivestep process that includes identifying the contract with the customer identifying the performance obligations in the contract determining the transaction price allocating the transaction prices to the performance obligations in the contract and recognizing revenue when or as the entity satisfies the performance obligations the guidance in the asu supersedes existing revenue recognition guidance and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 with early application not permitted the asu allows two methods of adoption a full retrospective approach where three years of financial information are presented in accordance with the new standard and a modified retrospective approach where the asu is applied to the most current period presented in the financial statements

on august 12 2015 the fasb voted for a oneyear deferral of the effective date of the new standard and now requires application of the new standard no later than annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 including interim reporting periods therein however under the proposal public entities would be permitted to elect to early adopt the new standard as of the original effective date we currently expect to adopt the new standard in fiscal year 2018 in accordance with the revised effective date

outlook 

activity in the local government software market continues to be good and with the inclusion of nws our backlog at december 31 2015 reached 8445 million a 20 increase from last year with our strong financial position and cash flow we plan to accelerate our investment in product development with expected research and development expense of approximately 470 million we believe that increasing the investment in our products will better position us to continue to expand our competitive position in the public sector software market over the long term

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements the reported amounts of revenues cost of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosure of contingencies the notes to the financial statements included as part of this annual report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the application of the percentageofcompletion and proportional performance methods of revenue recognition the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of intangible assets determination of sharebased compensation expense and valuation allowance 

 

 

for receivables we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that w e believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimate s under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards codification “asc” 605 revenue recognition and asc 985605 software revenue recognition our revenues are derived from sales of software licenses and royalties subscriptionbased services appraisal services maintenance and support and services that typically range from installation training and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs for multiple element software arrangements which do not entail the performance of services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software we generally record revenue when the delivered products or performed services result in a legally enforceable and nonrefundable claim we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized because most of our customers are governmental entities we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments in a limited number of cases we encounter a customer who is dissatisfied with some aspect of the software product or our service and we may offer a “concession” to such customer in those limited situations where we grant a concession we rarely reduce the contract arrangement fee but alternatively may perform additional services such as additional training or creating additional custom reports these amounts have historically been nominal in connection with our customer contracts and the adequacy of related allowances and measures of progress towards contract completion our project managers are charged with the responsibility to continually review the status of each customer on a specific contract basis also we review on at least a quarterly basis significant past due accounts receivable and the adequacy of related reserves events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments may require revision include but are not limited to deterioration of a customer’s financial condition failure to manage our customer’s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products 

we use contract accounting primarily the percentageofcompletion method as discussed in asc 60535 construction – type and certain production – type contracts for those software arrangements that involve significant production modification or customization of the software or where our software services are otherwise considered essential to the functionality of the software we measure progresstocompletion primarily using labor hours incurred or value added in addition we recognize revenue using the proportional performance method of revenue recognition for our property appraisal projects some of which can range up to five years these methods rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue billings and collections and expected contract costs as well as measures of progress toward completion we believe reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs and progress applicable to various stages of a contract can be made at times we perform additional andor noncontractual services for little to no incremental fee to satisfy customer expectations if changes occur in delivery productivity or other factors used in developing our estimates of expected costs or revenues we revise our cost and revenue estimates and any revisions are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision first become known in connection with these and certain other contracts we may perform the work prior to when the services are billable andor payable pursuant to the contract the termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the value of products delivered and services performed in the event of an early termination 

for saas arrangements we evaluate whether the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and whether the customer can feasibly maintain the software on the customer’s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a thirdparty to host the software if we determine that the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and can feasibly maintain the software on the customer’s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a thirdparty to host the software we recognize the license professional services and hosting services revenues pursuant to asc 985605 software revenue recognition for saas arrangements that do not meet the criteria for recognition under asc 985605 we account for the elements under asc 60525 multiple element arrangements using all applicable facts and circumstances including whether i the element has standalone value ii there is a general right of return and iii the revenue is contingent on delivery of other elements we allocate the contract value to each element of the arrangement that qualifies for treatment as a separate element based on vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” and if vsoe is not available thirdparty evidence and if thirdparty evidence is unavailable estimated selling price for professional services associated with saas arrangements that we determine do not have standalone value to the customer or are contingent on delivery of other elements we recognize the services revenue ratably over the remaining contractual period once hosting has gone live and we may begin billing for the hosting services we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 

 

 

in connection with certain of our contracts we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance s heet date many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period we review unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue in addition we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue which represents billings in excess of revenue earned the majority of this liability consists of maintenance billings for which payments are made in advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the maintenance period generally one year we also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit an d the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product has not been met on a periodic basis we review by customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains appropriate 

intangible assets and goodwill  our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge the cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value with the excess allocated to goodwill accordingly we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets including software customer related intangibles trade name leases and goodwill these intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives we currently have no intangible assets with indefinite lives other than goodwill 

when testing goodwill for impairment quantitatively we first compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is performed to measure the amount of potential impairment in the second step we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized the fair values calculated in our impairment tests are determined using discounted cash flow models involving several assumptions the assumptions that are used are based upon what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain we evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by comparing the total of the fair value of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed quantitatively during the second quarter of 2015 did not result in an impairment charge during 2015 we did not identify any triggering events that would require an update to our annual impairment review 

all intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of other intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows the assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved such indicators may include among others a significant decline in expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition and reductions in growth rates in addition products capabilities or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or noncompetitive any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets 

sharebased compensation we have a stock option plan that provides for the grant of stock options to key employees directors and nonemployee consultants we estimate the fair value of sharebased awards on the date of grant using the blackscholes option valuation model sharebased compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures which will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from such estimates changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data we estimate stock price volatility at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock estimated option life is determined using the weightedaverage period the stock options are expected to be outstanding based primarily on the options’ vesting terms remaining contractual life and the employees’ expected exercise based on historical patterns determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates 

 

 

 

analysis of results of operations and other 

the following discussion compares the historical results of operations on a basis consistent with gaap for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 

 



 

2015 compared to 2014 

revenues 

on november 16 2015 we acquired nws which provides public safety and financial solutions for local governments and its operating results are included with the operating results of the ess segment since the date of acquisition the following table details revenue for nws for the period from november 16 2015 to december 31 2015 which is included in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income 

 



in may 2015 we acquired a company which provides mobile handheld solutions primarily to law enforcement agencies for field accident reporting and electronically issuing citations in august 2014 we acquired a company which provides civil process management typically to county sheriff departments the impact of these acquisitions on our operating results are not considered 

 

 

material an d are not included in the table above the results of their operations are included in our ess segment from their respective dates of acquisition 

software licenses and royalties 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software licenses and royalties revenue for the years ended december 31 

 



 

excluding the results of acquisitions software license revenue increased 15 compared to the prior year the majority of this growth was due to a more active marketplace as the result of improvement in local government economic conditions as well as our increasingly strong competitive position which we attribute in part to our investment in product development in recent years in addition addon sales to our existing customer base for courts and justice related solutions that assist and support the transition to a paperless environment increased approximately 13 million 

 

although the mix of new contracts between subscriptionbased and perpetual license arrangements may vary from quarter to quarter and year to year we expect our longerterm software license growth rate to be negatively impacted by a growing number of customers choosing our subscriptionbased options rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement subscriptionbased arrangements result in lower software license revenue in the initial year as compared to perpetual software license arrangements but generate higher overall revenue over the term of the contract our new client mix in 2015 was approximately 76 selecting perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 24 selecting subscriptionbased arrangements compared to a client mix in 2014 of approximately 74 selecting perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 26 selecting subscriptionbased arrangements 134 new clients entered into subscriptionbased software arrangements in 2015 compared to 138 new clients in 2014 

subscriptions 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our subscriptions revenue for the years ended december 31 

 



 

subscriptionbased services revenue primarily consists of revenue derived from our saas arrangements which utilize the tyler private cloud as part of our subscriptionbased services we also provide electronic document filing solutions “efiling” that simplify the filing and management of court related documents for courts and law offices efiling revenue is derived from transaction fees and fixed fee arrangements 

subscriptionbased services revenue increased 27 compared to 2014 efiling services contributed approximately 77 million of the subscriptions revenue increase in 2015 most of the efiling revenue increase related to several statewide contracts several of which implemented mandatory electronic filing near the end of 2014 and throughout 2015 new saas clients as well as existing clients who converted to our saas model provided the remainder of the subscriptions revenue increase in 2015 we added 134 new saas clients and 66 existing clients elected to convert to our saas model the average contract sizes in 2015 were 38 and 22 higher than 2014 for new clients and clients converting to our saas model respectively

software services 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software services revenue for the years ended december 31

 



 

 

software services revenue primarily consists of professional services billed in connection with implementing our software converting client data training client pe rsonnel custom development activities and consulting new clients who purchase our proprietary software licenses generally also contract with us to provide for the related software services existing clients also periodically purchase additional training consulting and minor programming services excluding the results of acquisitions software services revenue grew 20 compared to the prior year period this growth is mainly due to much higher revenue from proprietary software arrangements as well as add itions to our implementation and support staff which increased our capacity to deliver backlog 

 

maintenance 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our maintenance revenue for the years ended december 31 

 



 

we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and certain thirdparty software excluding the results of acquisitions maintenance revenue grew 12 compared to the prior year maintenance and support revenue increased mainly due to growth in our installed customer base from new software license sales as well as annual maintenance rate increases

 

appraisal services 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our appraisal services revenue for the years ended december 31 

 



 

the appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states appraisal services revenue benefitted from the addition of several new revaluation contracts including the city of detroit and the current appraisal cycle in indiana both of which began in mid2014 in mid2015 franklin county ohio began a full reappraisal cycle which also contributed to appraisal services revenue 

cost of revenues and gross margins 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues for the years ended december 31 

 



 

 

  

the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the years ended december 31 

 



 

software licenses royalties and acquired software  costs of software licenses royalties and acquired software are primarily comprised of thirdparty software costs and amortization expense for acquired software we do not have any direct costs associated with royalties in 2015 our software licenses royalties and acquired software gross margin percentage declined compared to the prior year due to much higher amortization expense for acquired software resulting from our acquisition of nws excluding the results of nws our software license royalties and acquired software gross margin was 936 which increased 13 from the prior year period mainly due to higher revenues from proprietary software arrangements 

software services maintenance and subscriptions  cost of software services maintenance and subscriptions primarily consists of personnel costs related to installation of our software conversion of client data training client personnel and support activities and various other services such as custom client development and ongoing operation of saas and efiling arrangements in 2015 the software services maintenance and subscriptions gross margin percentage declined compared to the prior year mainly due to onboarding costs associated with accelerated hiring to ensure that we are wellpositioned to deliver our current backlog and anticipated new business excluding 285 employees added with acquisitions our implementation and support staff has grown by 200 employees since december 31 2014 in addition in 2015 we incurred 14 million more in contract labor cost than 2014 in an effort to maintain flexibility to accommodate fluctuations in demand for professional services the gross margin decline was somewhat offset because costs related to maintenance and various other services such as saas and efiling typically grow at a slower rate than related revenue due to leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale price increases also resulted in slightly higher rates on certain services 

appraisal services  appraisal services revenue comprised approximately 4 of total revenue the appraisal services gross margin increased 2 compared to 2014 a high proportion of the costs of appraisal services revenue are variable as we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects whose term of employment generally ends with the projects’ completion the appraisal services gross margin was favorably impacted by operational efficiencies associated with a large revaluation contract that began late 2014 

our 2015 blended gross margin declined 04 compared to 2014 the gross margin was negatively impacted by increased acquired software amortization expense associated with the nws acquisition and expenses associated with increased hiring of implementation and development staff in order to expand our capacity to implement our contract backlog 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses consist primarily of salaries employee benefits travel sharebased compensation expense commissions and related overhead costs for administrative and sales and marketing employees as well as professional fees trade show activities advertising costs and other marketing related costs the following table sets forth a comparison of our sga expenses for the following years ended december 31 

 



 

 

sga as a percentage of revenue was 226 in 2015 compared to 220 in 2014 in 2015 our sga expenses include approximately 59 million for financial advisory legal ac counting due diligence valuation and other various services necessary to complete the nws acquisition in addition our 2015 operating results include 40 million of sga expenses for nws from the date of acquisition the remaining sga expense increas e is mainly due to compensation cost related to increased staff levels higher stock compensation expense and increased commission expense as a result of higher sales excluding 140 employees added with acquisitions we have added 16 employees mainly to o ur sales and finance teams since december 31 2014 in addition our 2015 stock compensation expense rose 42 million mainly due to increases in our stock price over the last few years   

research and development expense 

research and development expense consists primarily of salaries employee benefits and related overhead costs associated with product development the following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the years ended december 31 

 



 

research and development expense consists mainly of costs associated with development of new products and technologies from which we do not currently generate revenue as well as costs related to the ongoing development efforts for microsoft dynamics ax in february 2015 we announced that our contractual research and development commitment to develop public sector functionality for microsoft dynamics ax expires with the release of dynamics ax 7 which is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2016 we are currently discussing with microsoft corporation the possibility of additional research and development beyond dynamics ax 7 if we cannot agree to terms of any future commitments we will continue to provide sustained engineering and technical support for the public sector functionality within dynamics ax license and maintenance royalties for all applicable domestic and international sales of dynamics ax to public sector entities will continue under the terms of the contract

 

research and development expense in 2015 includes approximately 15 million related to nws the remaining increase compared to 2014 was primarily due to increased staffing to maintain and enhance our competitive position and annual wage adjustments 

amortization of customer and trade name intangibles 

acquisition intangibles are comprised of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that is allocated to acquired software leases and customer and trade name intangibles the remaining excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues while amortization expense of customer and trade name intangibles is recorded as operating expense the estimated useful lives of both customer and trade name intangibles range from five to 25 years the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the years ended december 31 

 



 

in 2015 we completed two acquisitions that increased amortizable customer and trade name intangibles by approximately 1278 million this amount is being amortized over a weighted average period of 15 years we also added approximately 37 million to acquisition related intangibles to reflect the fair value of acquired leases which will be amortized over the weighted average life of 9 years 

 

estimated annual amortization expense relating to customer and trade name acquisition intangibles excluding acquired software for which the amortization expense is recorded as cost of revenues for the next five years is as follows in thousands 

 



 

 

amortization expense relating to acquired leases will be recorded as a reduction to other income and is expected to be 444000 in 2016 444000 in 2017 426000 in 2018 372000 in 2019 313000 in 2020 and 17 million thereafter

other income expense is comprised of interest income from invested cash as well as interest expense and nonusage and other fees associated with our revolving credit agreement expenses in 2014 were comprised primarily of nonusage and other fees associated with a revolving debt agreement that terminated in august 2014 offset slightly by interest income from invested cash in 2015 we had significantly higher invested cash balances than 2014 until we completed the nws acquisition on november 16 2015 

income tax provision 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the years ended december 31 

 



 

the effective income tax rates were different from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of 35 principally due to state income taxes nondeductible sharebased compensation expense the qualified manufacturing activities deduction disqualifying incentive stock option dispositions  nondeductible meals and entertainment costs and nondeductible transaction costs a lower qualified manufacturing activities deduction and nondeductible transaction costs related to the nws acquisition negatively impacted our 2015 effective tax rate 

in the past few years a relatively high amount of excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises have resulted in a reduction in our qualified manufacturing activities deduction the qualified manufacturing activities deduction can be limited to a certain level of taxable income on the tax return therefore any significant items that reduce taxable income such as excess tax benefits on stock options can reduce the amount of the qualified manufacturing activities deduction we experienced significant stock option exercise activity in 2015 and 2014 that generated excess tax benefits of 453 million and 194 million respectively 

2014 compared to 2013 

revenues 

software licenses and royalties 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software licenses and royalties revenue for the years ended december 31 

 



 

software license and royalties revenue growth was mainly due to a more active marketplace as the result of improvement in local government economic conditions as well as our increasingly strong competitive position which we attribute in part to our increased investments in product development over the past few years an increase in the number of larger contracts in particular in the courts and justice market also contributed to the growth in license revenue 

 

 

 

software license revenue was reduced so mewhat because of a growing number of clients choosing our subscription based options rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement 138 new clients entered into subscriptionbased software arrangements in 2014 compared to 100 new clients in 2013 

subscriptions 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our subscriptions revenue for the years ended december 31 

 



 

subscriptionbased services revenue increased 42 compared to 2013 efiling services contributed approximately 133 million of the subscriptions revenue increase in 2014 most of the efiling revenue increase related to higher revenue from a contract with the texas office of court administration for our odyssey file and serve efiling system for texas courts “efiletexasgov” for civil court filings which was implemented in september 2013 the state of texas mandated all counties use efiletexasgov this contract provided a recurring revenue stream that totaled 170 million in 2014 new saas clients as well as existing clients who converted to our saas model provided the remainder of the subscriptions revenue increase in 2014 we added 138 new saas clients and 59 existing clients elected to convert to our saas model 

software services  

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software services revenue for the years ended december 31

maintenance  

the following table sets forth a comparison of our maintenance revenue for the years ended december 31

the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the years ended december 31 

 



 

software licenses royalties and acquired software  in 2014 our software licenses royalties and acquired software gross margin percentage increased compared to 2013 mainly due to higher revenues from proprietary software revenues which have a higher gross margin than thirdparty software 

software services maintenance and subscriptionbased services  the software services maintenance and subscriptions gross margin percentage increased mainly due to revenue from a contract with the texas office of court administration for efiletexasgov to manage efiling of court documents this contract began in september 2013 but we incurred initial startup costs in 2013 for which there were very limited related revenues the addition of revenue from this contract since 2013 accounted for most of the gross margin increase the gross margin increase was offset somewhat by costs related to accelerated hiring to ensure that we are wellpositioned to deliver our current backlog and anticipated new business our implementation development and support staff has increased in 2014 by 215 employees since 2013 

appraisal services  the appraisal services gross margin increased slightly compared to 2013 a high proportion of the costs of appraisal services revenue are variable as we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects whose term of employment generally ends with the projects’ completion 

our blended gross margin for 2014 increased 09 from 2013 the gross margin increase was mainly due to a revenue mix that included more software license revenue and subscription revenue and in particular increased revenue from efiling in texas this improvement in gross margin was offset somewhat by expenses associated with increased hiring of implementation development and support staff in order to expand our capacity to implement our contract backlog 

selling general and administrative expenses 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our sga expenses for the following years ended december 31 

 



 

sga as a percentage of revenue was 220 in 2014 compared to 236 in 2013 approximately onethird of the sga expense increase was from higher commission expense due to sales growth stock compensation expense contributed approximately one

 

 

quarter of the increase primarily due to increases in our stock price the remaining increase consisted of higher bonuses related to operating results annual wage adjustments and increased travel expenses

the following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the years ended december 31

other 

the following table sets forth a comparison of other expense net for the years ended december 31 

 



 

other expense net was primarily comprised of interest expense nonusage and other fees associated with a revolving line of credit agreement that matured in august 2014 offset somewhat by interest income associated with invested cash balances interest expense declined compared to the prior year because we repaid all borrowings under the revolving credit agreement in early 2013 and had no debt outstanding during 2014 

income tax provision 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the years ended december 31 

 



 

the effective income tax rates were different from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of 35 due to state income taxes nondeductible sharebased compensation expense the qualified manufacturing activities deduction disqualifying incentive stock option dispositions and nondeductible meals and entertainment costs the qualified manufacturing activities deduction increased in 2014 which contributed to a lower effective tax rate 

 

we experienced significant stock option exercise activity in 2014 and 2013 that generated excess tax benefits of 194 million and 282 million respectively excess tax benefits reduce tax payments but do not significantly reduce the effective tax rate and can result in limitations on other deductions in 2013 limitations resulting from excess tax benefits eliminated the qualified manufacturing activities deduction which negatively impacted our effective tax rate

 

 

 

financial condition and liquidity 

as of december 31 2015 we had cash and cash equivalents of 331 million compared to 2062 million at december 31 2014 we also had 309 million invested in investment grade corporate and municipal bonds as of december 31 2015 these investments mature between 2016 and mid2017 and we intend to hold these investments until maturity cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with several domestic banks and money market funds as of december 31 2015 we had 660 million in outstanding borrowings and an outstanding letter of credit totaling 15 million in connection with one contract we do not believe this letter of credit will be required to be drawn upon this letter of credit expires in mid2016 we believe our revolving line of credit cash from operating activities cash on hand and access to the credit markets provides us with sufficient flexibility to meet our longterm financial needs 

 

the following table sets forth a summary of cash flows for the years ended december 31 

 



 

net cash provided by operating activities continues to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures other potential capital resources include cash on hand public and private issuances of debt or equity securities and bank borrowings it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets in the future may be limited by economic conditions or other factors we currently believe that cash provided by operating activities cash on hand and available credit are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures income tax obligations and share repurchases for at least the next twelve months 

in 2015 operating activities provided cash of 890 million operating activities that provided cash were primarily comprised of net income of 649 million noncash depreciation and amortization charges of 196 million and noncash sharebased compensation expense of 202 million cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted in 2015 by tax payments that were 171 million higher than the prior year partly due to more taxable income and partly due to timing of stock option exercises and our ability to utilize related excess tax credits to determine estimated tax payments during the year our excess tax credit in 2015 was 453 million of which over 70 was generated in the fourth quarter and as a result we recorded a 211 million income tax receivable at december 31 2015 accounts receivable also increased due to timing of annual maintenance and subscription billings due to growth in our customer base as well as normal maintenance billings of approximately 150 million associated with nws these negative impacts on operating cash were offset somewhat by growth in deferred maintenance revenue in general changes in the balance of deferred revenue are cyclical and primarily driven by the timing of our maintenance renewal billings our renewal dates occur throughout the year but our heaviest renewal cycles occur in the second and fourth quarters in addition deferred revenue included one unusually large customer deposit of 75 million at december 31 2015

days sales outstanding in accounts receivable were 100 days at december 31 2015 compared to 80 days at december 31 2014 mainly due to the impact on the dso calculation of having approximately seven weeks of postacquisition revenues from nws but included all of their outstanding accounts receivable at december 31 2015 dsos are calculated based on accounts receivable excluding longterm receivables but including unbilled receivables divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by 360 days excluding nws dsos were 79 days at december 31 2015

investing activities used cash of 3985 million in 2015 compared to 116 million in 2014 on november 16 2015 we acquired all of the capital stock of nws which provides public safety and financial solutions for local governments the purchase price net of cash acquired of 225 million was 3375 million in cash of which 40 million was accrued at december 31 2015 and 21 million shares of tyler common stock valued at 3628 million on may 29 2015 we acquired all of the capital stock of brazos technology corporation which provides mobile hand held solutions primarily to law enforcement agencies for field accident reporting and electronically issuing citations the purchase price net of cash acquired and including debt assumed was 61 million in cash and 12500 shares of tyler common stock valued at 15 million on january 30 2015 we made a 150 million investment in convertible preferred stock representing a 20 interest in record holdings pty limited we also invested 309 million in investment grade corporate and municipal bonds maturing between 2016 and mid2017 the remaining use of cash was for capital expenditures related to computer equipment furniture and fixtures in support of internal growth particularly with respect to growth in our cloudbased offerings these expenditures were funded from cash generated from operations cash on hand and bank borrowings

 

 

in 2014 we completed the acquisition of softcode inc for a purchase price of 35 million in cash of which 325000 was accrued at decem ber 31 2014 and 16540 shares of tyler common stock valued at 15 million the remaining use of cash in 2014 was comprised primarily of capital expenditures related to computer equipment furniture and fixtures in support of internal growth investing a ctivities in 2013 included 203 million paid in connection with the construction of an office building in plano texas 

financing activities provided cash of 1364 million in 2015 compared to 154 million in 2014 financing activities were comprised of net borrowings of 660 million collections of 278 million from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan activity and 453 million excess tax benefit from exercises of sharebased arrangements we purchased approximately 5400 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 645000 in 2015 and paid 21 million in debt issuance costs financing activities in 2014 were comprised of collections of 188 million from stock option exercises and contributions from the employee stock purchase plan and 194 million excess tax benefit from exercises of sharebased arrangements these increases were offset somewhat by purchases of 294000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 228 million financing activities in 2013 were comprised of collections of 218 million from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan activity and 282 million excess tax benefit from exercises of sharebased arrangements offset partially by 180 million in net payments on our revolving line of credit 

the share repurchase program which was approved by our board of directors was announced in october 2002 and was amended at various times from 2003 through 2011 as of december 31 2015 we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to 14 million additional shares of our common stock our share repurchase program allows us to repurchase shares at our discretion market conditions influence the timing of the buybacks and the number of shares repurchased as well as the volume of employee stock option exercises share repurchases are generally funded using our existing cash balances and borrowings under our credit facility and may occur through open market purchases and transactions structured through investment banking institutions privately negotiated transactions andor other mechanisms there is no expiration date specified for the authorization and we intend to repurchase stock under the plan from time to time 

subsequent to december 31 2015 and through february 22 2016 we purchased approximately 241000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate cash purchase price of 313 million

on november 16 2015 we entered into a 3000 million credit agreement the “credit facility” with various lenders party thereto and wells fargo bank national association as administrative agent the credit facility provides for a revolving credit line of 3000 million with a 100 million sublimit for letters of credit the credit facility matures on november 16 2020 borrowings under the credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes including working capital requirements acquisitions and share repurchases in 2015 we paid 21 million in related debt issuance costs which are included with other assets on the accompanying balance sheet

borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a rate of either 1 the wells fargo bank prime rate subject to certain higher rate determinations plus a margin of 025 to 100 or 2 the 30 60 90 or 180day libor rate plus a margin of 125 to 200 in 2015 our effective average interest rate for borrowings was 18 as of december 31 2015 our interest rate was 16 the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets the credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial conditions and prohibits us from making certain investments advances cash dividends or loans and limits incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens as of december 31 2015 we were in compliance with those covenants

at december 31 2015 we had 660 million in outstanding borrowings and unused borrowing capacity of 2340 million under the credit facility

we paid income taxes net of refunds received of 273 million in 2015 102 million in 2014 and 93 million in 2013 we experienced significant stock option exercise activity in 2015 that generated 453 million excess tax benefits excess tax benefits reduce tax payments but do not significantly reduce the effective tax rate and can result in limitations on other deductions however more than 70 of our 2015 excess tax benefit was generated in the fourth quarter of 2015 and as a result we recorded an income tax receivable of 211 million which will reduce income tax payments in 2016 in 2014 and 2013 excess tax benefits were 194 million and 282 million respectively 

excluding acquisitions we anticipate that 2016 capital spending will be between 310 million and 330 million we expect the majority of this capital spending will consist of computer equipment and software for infrastructure replacements and expansion we also expect to purchase a leased office building in falmouth maine for approximately 100 million we currently do not expect to capitalize significant amounts related to software development in 2016 but the actual amount and timing of those costs and whether they are capitalized or expensed may result in additional capitalized software development capital spending is expected to be funded from existing cash balances cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving line of credit 

 

 

from time to time we engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates in order to pursue such opportunities which could require signifi cant commitments of capital we may be required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive securities in the future no assurance can be given as to our future acquisition opportunities and how such opportunities will be financed 

we lease office facilities as well as transportation computer and other equipment used in our operations under noncancelable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through 2022 most leases contain renewal options and some contain purchase options 

summarized in the table below are our obligations to make future payments under our credit facility and lease obligations at december 31 2015 in thousands

market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial market prices and interest rates 

as of december 31 2015 we had 660 million in outstanding borrowings under the credit facility loans under the credit facility bear interest at tyler’s option at a per annum rate of either 1 the wells fargo bank prime rate subject to certain higher rate determinations plus a margin of 025 to 100 or 2 the 30 60 90 or 180day libor rate plus a margin of 125 to 200

tyler was founded in 1966 prior to 1998 we operated as a diversified industrial conglomerate with operations in various industrial retail and distribution businesses all of which have been divested in 1997 we embarked on a multiphase growth plan focused on serving the specialized information management needs of local governments nationwide in 1998 and 1999 we entered the local government it market through a series of strategic acquisitions 

market overview 

the state and local government market is one of the largest and most decentralized it markets in the country consisting of all 50 states approximately 3000 counties 36000 cities and towns and 13900 school districts this market is also comprised of approximately 37000 special districts and other agencies each with specialized delegated responsibilities and unique information management requirements 

traditionally local government bodies and agencies performed statemandated duties including property assessment record keeping road maintenance law enforcement administration of election and judicial functions and the provision of welfare assistance today a host of emerging and urgent issues are confronting local governments each of which demands a service response these areas include criminal justice and corrections administration and finance public safety health and human services planning regulatory and maintenance and records and document management transfers of responsibility from the federal and state governments to county and municipal governments and agencies in these and other areas also place additional service and financial requirements on these local government units in addition constituents of local governments are increasingly demanding improved service and better access to information from public entities as a result local governments recognize the increasing value of information management systems and services to among other things improve revenue collection provide increased access to information and streamline delivery of services to their constituents local government bodies are now recognizing that “egovernment” is an additional responsibility for community development from integrated tax systems to integrated civil and criminal justice information systems many counties and cities have benefited significantly from the implementation of jurisdictionwide systems that allow different agencies or government offices to share data and provide a more comprehensive approach to information management many city and county governmental agencies also have unique individual information management requirements which must be tailored to the specific functions of each particular office 

many local governments also have difficulties attracting and retaining the staff necessary to support their it functions as a result they seek to establish longterm relationships with reliable providers of high quality it products and services such as tyler 

although local governments generally face budgetary constraints in their operations their primary revenue sources are usually property taxes and to a lesser extent utility billings and other fees which historically tend to be relatively stable in addition the acquisition of new technology typically enables local governments to operate more efficiently and often provides a measurable return on investment that justifies the purchase of software and related services 

gartner inc a leading information technology research and advisory company estimates that state and local government application and vertical specific software spending will grow from 110 billion in 2015 to 129 billion in 2018 the professional services and support segments of the market where our business is primarily focused is expected to expand from 328 billion in 2015 to 350 billion in 2018 application and vertical specific software sales in the primary and secondary education segments of the market is 

 

 

expected to expand from 20 billion in 2015 to 25 billion in 2018 while professional services and support are expected to grow from 24 billion in 2015 to 27 billion in 2018 

products and services 

we provide a comprehensive and flexible suite of products and services that addresses the information technology needs of cities counties schools and other local government entities we derive our revenues from five primary sources

historically we have had a greater proportion of our annual revenues in the second half of our fiscal year due to governmental budget and spending cycles and the timing of system implementations for clients desiring to “go live” at the beginning of the calendar year

subscriptionbased services 

subscriptionbased revenue is primarily derived from our saas arrangements which utilize the tyler private cloud as well as our transaction based offerings such as efiling solutions 

we are able to provide the majority of our software products through our saas model the clients who choose this model typically do not wish to maintain update and operate these systems or make upfront capital expenditures to implement these advanced technologies the contract terms for these arrangements range from one to 10 years but are typically contracted for a period of three to six years the majority of our saas or hosting arrangements include additional professional services as well as maintenance and support services in certain arrangements the client may also acquire a license to the software 

as part of our subscriptionbased services we provide efiling solutions that simplify the filing and management of court related documents for courts and law offices revenues for efiling are included in subscriptionbased revenues and are derived from transaction fees and in some cases fixed fee arrangements

virtually all of our software clients contract with us for maintenance and support which provides us with a significant source of recurring revenue we generally provide maintenance and support under annual contracts with a typical fee based on a percentage of the software product’s license fee these fees can be increased annually and may also increase as new license fees increase maintenance and support fees are generally paid in advance for the entire maintenance contract period most maintenance contracts automatically renew unless the client or tyler gives notice of termination prior to expiration similar support is provided to our saas clients and is included in their subscription fees which are classified as subscriptionbased revenues 

appraisal services 

we are the nation’s largest provider of property appraisal outsourcing services for local government taxing authorities these services include 













local government taxing authorities normally reappraise properties from time to time to update values for tax assessment purposes and to maintain equity in the taxing process in some jurisdictions law mandates reassessment cycles in others they are discretionary while some taxing jurisdictions perform reappraisals inhouse many local governments outsource this function because of its cyclical nature and because of the specialized knowledge and expertise requirements associated with it our appraisal services business unit has been in this business since 1938 

in some instances we also sell property tax andor appraisal software products in connection with appraisal outsourcing projects while other clients may only engage us to provide appraisal services appraisal outsourcing services are somewhat seasonal in nature to the extent that winter weather conditions reduce the productivity of data collection activities in connection with those projects 

strategy 

our objective is to grow our revenue and earnings internally supplemented by focused strategic acquisitions the key components of our business strategy are to 





 

 























on february 4 2015 we announced that our contractual research and development commitment to develop public sector functionality for microsoft dynamics ax expires with the release of dynamics ax 7 we do not anticipate continuing any research and development commitment although we will continue to provide sustained engineering and technical support for the public sector functionality within dynamics ax we further expect that license and maintenance royalties for all applicable domestic and international sales of dynamics ax to public sector entities will continue under the terms of the contract

 

 

sales marketing and clients 

we market our products and services through direct sales and marketing personnel located throughout the united states other inhouse sales staff focus on addon sales professional services and support 

sales of new systems are typically generated from referrals from other government offices or departments within a county or municipality referrals from other local governments relationships established between sales representatives and county or local officials contacts at trade shows direct mailings and direct contact from prospects already familiar with us we are active in numerous national state county and local government associations and participate in annual meetings trade shows and educational events 

clients consist primarily of county and municipal agencies school districts and other local government offices in counties clients include the auditor treasurer tax assessorcollector county clerk district clerk county and district court judges probation officers sheriff and county appraiser at municipal government sites clients include directors from various departments including administration finance utilities public works code enforcement personnel purchasing taxation municipal court and police contracts for software products and services are generally implemented over periods of three months to one year with annually renewing maintenance and support update agreements thereafter although either the client or we can terminate these agreements historically almost all support and maintenance agreements are automatically renewed annually contracts for appraisal outsourcing services are generally one to three years in duration during 2014 approximately 43 of our revenue was attributable to ongoing support and maintenance agreements

competition 

we compete with numerous local regional and national firms that provide or offer some or many of the same solutions and services that we provide many of these competitors are smaller companies that may be able to offer less expensive solutions than ours many of these firms operate within a specific geographic area andor in a narrow product or service niche we also compete with national firms some of which have greater financial and technical resources than we do including oracle corporation infor lawson sap ag sungard data systems inc thomson reuters corporation new world systems and constellation software inc in addition we sometimes compete with consulting and systems integration firms which develop custom systems primarily for larger governments we also occasionally compete with central internal information service departments of local governments which requires us to persuade the enduser department to discontinue service by its own personnel and outsource the service to us 

we compete on a variety of factors including price service name recognition reputation technological capabilities and the ability to modify existing products and services to accommodate the individual requirements of the client our ability to offer an integrated system of applications for several offices or departments is often a competitive advantage local governmental units often are required to seek competitive proposals through a request for proposal process and some prospective clients use consultants to assist them with the proposal and vendor selection process 

suppliers 

substantially all of the computers peripherals printers scanners operating system software office automation software and other equipment necessary for the implementation and provision of our software systems and services are presently available from several thirdparty sources hardware is purchased on original equipment manufacturer or distributor terms at discounts from retail we have not experienced any significant supply problems 

backlog 

at december 31 2014 our estimated revenue backlog was approximately 7020 million compared to 5517 million at december 31 2013 the backlog represents signed contracts under which the revenue has not been recognized as of yearend approximately 3814 million or 54 of the backlog is expected to be recognized during 2015

intellectual property proprietary rights and licenses 

we regard certain features of our internal operations software and documentation as confidential and proprietary and rely on a combination of contractual restrictions trade secret laws and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property we generally do not rely on patents we believe that due to the rapid rate of technological change in the computer software industry trade secrets and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as knowledge ability and experience of our employees frequent product enhancements and timeliness and quality of support services we typically license our software products under nonexclusive license agreements which are generally nontransferable and have a perpetual term 

 

 

employees 

at december 31 2014 we had 2856 employees appraisal outsourcing projects are cyclical in nature and can be widely dispersed geographically we often hire temporary employees to assist in these projects whose term of employment generally ends with the project’s completion none of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to collective bargaining agreements we consider our relations with our employees to be positive

risk factors 

tableend

an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk investors evaluating our company should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this annual report any of the following factors could materially harm our business operating results and financial condition additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business operating results and financial condition this section should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report we may make forwardlooking statements from time to time both written and oral we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forwardlooking statements our actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forwardlooking statements due to a number of factors including those set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report 

risks associated with selling products and services into the public sector marketplace 

a prolonged economic slowdown could harm our operations 

a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce demand for our software products and services local and state governments may face financial pressures that could in turn affect our growth rate and profitability in the future there is no assurance that local and state spending levels will be unaffected by declining or stagnant general economic conditions and if budget shortfalls occur they may negatively impact local and state information technology “it” spending and could adversely affect our business 

selling products and services into the public sector poses unique challenges 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of software and services to state county and city governments other municipal agencies and other public entities we expect that sales to public sector clients will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues in the future we face many risks and challenges associated with contracting with governmental entities including 











 

 





each of these risks is outside our control if we fail to adequately adapt to these risks and uncertainties our financial performance could be adversely affected 

a decline in the demand for it may result in a decrease in our revenues or lower our growth rate 

a decline in the demand for it among our current and prospective clients may result in decreased revenues or a lower growth rate because our sales depend in part on our clients’ level of funding for new or additional it systems and services moreover demand for our solutions may be reduced by a decline in overall demand for computer software and services we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase or maintain our revenues 

the open bidding process creates uncertainty in predicting future contract awards 

many governmental agencies purchase products and services through an open bidding process generally a governmental entity will publish an established list of requirements requesting potential vendors to propose solutions for the established requirements to respond successfully to these requests for proposals we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract the time required to establish operations for the proposed client and the likely terms of any other thirdparty proposals submitted we cannot guarantee that we will win any bids in the future through the request for proposal process or that any winning bids will ultimately result in contracts on favorable terms our failure to secure contracts through the open bidding process or to secure such contracts on favorable terms may adversely affect our revenue and gross margins 

we face significant competition from other vendors and potential new entrants into our markets 

we believe we are a leading provider of integrated solutions for the public sector however we face competition from a variety of software vendors that offer products and services similar to those offered by us as well as from companies offering to develop custom software we compete based on a number of factors including 















we believe the market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors that vary in size product platform and product scope our competitors include consulting firms publicly held companies that focus on selected segments of the public sector market and a significant number of smaller privately held companies certain competitors have greater technical marketing and financial resources than we do we cannot assure you that such competitors will not develop products or offer services that are superior to our products or services or that achieve greater market acceptance 

we also compete with internal centralized it departments of governmental entities which requires us to persuade the enduser to stop the internal service and outsource to us in addition our clients and prospective clients could elect to provide information management services internally through new or existing departments which could reduce the market for our services 

we could face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the public sector software application market and new products and technologies are introduced increased competition could result in pricing pressure fewer client orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with thirdparties thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective clients it is possible that new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect upon our business 

 

 

fixedprice contracts may affect our profits 

some of our contracts are on a fixedpriced basis which can lead to various risks including 







if we do not adequately assess these and other risks we may be subject to cost overruns and penalties which may harm our financial performance

  changes in the insurance markets may affect our business 

some of our clients primarily those for our property appraisal services require that we secure performance bonds before they will select us as their vendor in addition we have in the past been required to provide letters of credit as security for the issuance of a performance bond we cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure such performance bonds in the future on terms that are favorable to us if at all our inability to obtain performance bonds on favorable terms or at all could impact our future ability to win some contract awards particularly large property appraisal services contracts which could negatively impact revenues in addition the general insurance markets experience volatility which may lead to future increases in our general and administrative expenses and negatively impact our operating results 

risks associated with our software products 

we run the risk of errors or defects with new products or enhancements to existing products 

our software products are complex and may contain errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released although we have not experienced material adverse effects from any such defects or errors to date we cannot assure you that material defects and errors will not be found in the future any such defects could result in a loss of revenues or delay market acceptance our license agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability however it is possible we may not always successfully negotiate such provisions in our client contracts or the limitation of liability provisions may not be effective due to existing or future federal state or local laws ordinances or judicial decisions although we maintain errors and omissions and general liability insurance and we try to structure contracts to limit liability we cannot assure you that a successful claim could not be made or would not have a material adverse effect on our future operating results 

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities can disrupt our business and harm our competitive position 

threats to it security can take a variety of forms individuals and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations including statesponsored organizations may take steps that pose threats to our clients and our it they may develop and deploy malicious software to attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and data centers or act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks cyber threats are constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and clients breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications impair our ability to provide services to our clients and protect the privacy of their data result in product development delays compromise confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies or otherwise adversely affect our business our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these evolving threats 

we cannot fully protect client information from security breaches 

as we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloudbased offerings we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable and other confidential information of our clients the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security despite our efforts to improve security controls it is possible our security controls over personal data our training of employees on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of client data that we store and manage improper disclosure could harm our reputation lead to legal exposure to clients or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 

 

 

hosting services for some of our products are dependent upon the uninterrupted operation of data centers 

a material portion of our business is provided through software hosting services these hosting services depend on the uninterrupted operation of data centers and the ability to protect computer equipment and information stored in these data centers against damage that may be caused by natural disaster fire power loss telecommunications or internet failure acts of terrorism unauthorized intrusion computer viruses and other similar damaging events if any of our data centers were to become inoperable for an extended period we might be unable to fulfill our contractual commitments although we take what we believe to be reasonable precautions against such occurrences we can give no assurance that damaging events such as these will not result in a prolonged interruption of our services which could result in client dissatisfaction loss of revenue and damage to our business 

we must timely respond to technological changes to be competitive 

the market for our products is characterized by technological change evolving industry standards in software technology changes in client requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments satisfy increasingly sophisticated client requirements and achieve market acceptance we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and costeffective manner the products capabilities or technologies developed by others could also render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to develop or acquire new software products or develop enhancements to existing products on a timely and costeffective basis or if such new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance

we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights 

many of our product and service offerings incorporate proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of contracts copyrights and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology we cannot be certain that we have taken all appropriate steps to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property there has also been significant litigation recently involving intellectual property rights we are not currently involved in any material intellectual property litigation however we may be a party to such litigation in the future to protect our proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights we cannot assure you that thirdparties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us with respect to current or future products any claims or litigation with or without merit could be timeconsuming costly and a diversion to management any such claims and litigation could also cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements such royalty or licensing arrangements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all therefore litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business regardless of the final outcome of such litigation 

clients may elect to terminate our maintenance contracts and manage operations internally 

it is possible that our clients may elect to not renew maintenance contracts for our software trying instead to maintain and operate the software themselves using their perpetual license rights excluding software applications that we provide on a softwareasaservice or hosted basis this could adversely affect our revenues and profits additionally they may inadvertently allow our intellectual property or other information to fall into the hands of thirdparties including our competitors which could adversely affect our business 

material portions of our business require the internet infrastructure to be further developed or adequately maintained 

part of our future success depends on the use of the internet as a means to access public information and perform transactions electronically including for example electronic filing of court documents this in part requires the further development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure among other things this further development and maintenance will require a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed data capacity security and timely development of complementary products for providing reliable internet access and services if this infrastructure fails to be further developed or be adequately maintained our business would be harmed because users may not be able to access our government portals

 

 

 

risks associated with our periodic results and stock price 

software revenue recognition rules may require us to delay revenue recognition into future periods 

we have in the past had to and may in the future be required to defer revenue recognition for software license fees due to several factors including whether 













because of these factors and other specific requirements for software revenue recognition under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states we must have very precise terms in our contracts to recognize revenue upon the delivery and installation of our software or performance of services negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions may extend the sales cycle we are not always able to negotiate terms and conditions that permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery or even upon project completion 

fluctuations in quarterly revenue could adversely impact our operating results and stock price 

our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter for a variety of reasons including the following 















in each fiscal quarter our expense levels operating costs and hiring plans are based to some extent on projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed if our actual revenues fall below expectations we could experience a reduction in operating results also if actual revenues for any given quarter fall below expectations it may lead to a decline in our stock price 

increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins 

we realize lower margins on software and appraisal service revenues than on license revenue the majority of our contracts include both software licenses and software services therefore an increase in the percentage of software service and appraisal service revenue compared to license revenue could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and could adversely affect operating results 

 

 

 

our stock price may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile examples of factors that may significantly impact our stock price include 















in addition the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of technology company stocks and may in the future adversely affect the market price of our stock sometimes securities class action litigation is filed following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities we cannot assure you that similar litigation will not occur in the future with respect to us such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect upon our financial performance 

financial outlook 

from time to time in press releases and otherwise we may publish forecasts or other forwardlooking statements regarding our results including estimated revenues or earnings any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties and as a matter of course any number of them may prove to be incorrect further the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors including those described in this discussion many of which are beyond our control as a result we cannot be certain that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse current and potential stockholders are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions but instead are encouraged to utilize our entire publicly available mix of historical and forwardlooking information as well as other available information regarding us our products and services and the software industry when evaluating our prospective results of operations 

risks associated with our growth strategy and other general corporate risks 

we may experience difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy 

a material portion of our historical growth has resulted from strategic acquisitions although our focus is on internal growth we will continue to identify and pursue strategic acquisitions with suitable candidates these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy that we get no satisfactory return on our investment that we have difficulty integrating business systems and technology that we have difficulty retaining or integrating new employees that the transactions distract management from our other businesses that we acquire unforeseen liabilities and other unanticipated events our future success will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate future acquisitions into our operations it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits of these transactions such as increased revenue enhanced efficiencies or increased market share or the benefits may be ultimately smaller than we expected although we conduct due diligence reviews of potential acquisition candidates we may not identify all material liabilities or risks related to acquisition candidates there can be no assurance that any such strategic acquisitions will be accomplished on favorable terms or will result in profitable operations 

our failure to properly manage growth could adversely affect our business 

we have expanded our operations significantly since 1998 when we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector we intend to continue expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities this growth places a significant demand on management and operational resources in order to manage growth effectively we must implement and improve our operational systems procedures and controls on a timely basis if we fail to implement these systems our business may be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to hire integrate and retain qualified personnel 

our continued success will depend upon the availability and performance of our key management sales marketing client support and product development personnel the loss of key management or technical personnel could adversely affect us we believe that 

 

 

our continued success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract integrate and retain such personnel we have at times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel competition for qualified software development sales and other personnel is intense and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance may result in additional expenses 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure can create uncertainty for public companies the costs required to comply with such evolving laws are difficult to predict to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards this investment may result in an unforeseen increase in general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenuegenerating activities which may harm our operating results 

we don’t foresee paying dividends on our common stock 

we have not declared or paid a cash dividend since we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector in 1998 we intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law could deter takeover attempts 

our board of directors may issue up to 1000000 shares of preferred stock and may determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting and conversion rights of these preferred shares these determinations may be made without any further vote or action by our stockholders the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock in addition some provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and the delaware general corporation law could also delay prevent or make more difficult a merger tender offer or proxy contest involving us

new accounting pronouncements 

on may 28 2014 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” this asu is the result of a convergence project between the fasb and the international accounting standards board the core principle behind asu 201409 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for delivering those goods and services this model involves a fivestep process that includes identifying the contract with the customer identifying the performance obligations in the contract determining the transaction price allocating the transaction prices to the performance obligations in the contract and recognizing revenue when or as the entity satisfies the performance obligations the guidance in the asu supersedes existing revenue recognition guidance and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 with early application not permitted the asu allows two methods of adoption a full retrospective approach where three years of financial information are presented in accordance with the new standard and a modified retrospective approach where the asu is applied to the most current period presented in the financial statements we are currently assessing the financial impact of adopting the new standard and the methods of adoption however given the scope of the new standard we are currently unable to provide a reasonable estimate regarding the financial impact or which method of adoption of the new standard we will elect 

outlook 

we believe activity in the local government market is good and has returned to normal prerecession levels although we expect to see some pressure on margin expansion in 2015 as we absorb onboarding costs associated with staffing additions in recent quarters make some strategic incremental product investments and continue to grow our saas and efiling client bases our expectation is that 2015 will be another year of very solid revenue and earnings growth 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements the reported amounts of revenues cost of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosure of contingencies the notes to the financial statements included as part of this annual report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the application of the percentageofcompletion and proportional performance methods of revenue recognition the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of intangible assets determination of sharebased compensation expense and valuation allowance for receivables we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards codification “asc” 605 revenue recognition and asc 985605 software revenue recognition our revenues are derived from sales of software licenses and royalties subscriptionbased services appraisal services maintenance and support and services that typically range from installation training and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs for multiple element software arrangements which do not entail the performance of services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software we generally record revenue when the delivered products or performed services result in a legally enforceable and nonrefundable claim we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized because most of our customers are governmental entities we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments in a limited number of cases we encounter a customer who is dissatisfied with some aspect of the software product or our service and we may offer a “concession” to such customer in those limited situations where we grant a concession we rarely reduce the contract arrangement fee but alternatively may perform additional services such as additional training or creating additional custom reports these amounts have historically been nominal in connection with our customer contracts and the adequacy of related allowances and measures of progress towards contract completion our project managers are charged with the responsibility to continually review the status of each customer on a specific contract basis also we review on at least a quarterly basis significant past due accounts receivable and the adequacy of related reserves events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments may require revision include but are not limited to deterioration of a customer’s financial condition failure to manage our customer’s 

 

 

expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products 

we use contract accounting primarily the percentageofcompletion method as discussed in asc 60535 construction – type and certain production – type contracts for those software arrangements that involve significant production modification or customization of the software or where our software services are otherwise considered essential to the functionality of the software we measure progresstocompletion primarily using labor hours incurred or value added in addition we recognize revenue using the proportional performance method of revenue recognition for our property appraisal projects some of which can range up to five years these methods rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue billings and collections and expected contract costs as well as measures of progress toward completion we believe reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs and progress applicable to various stages of a contract can be made at times we perform additional andor noncontractual services for little to no incremental fee to satisfy customer expectations if changes occur in delivery productivity or other factors used in developing our estimates of expected costs or revenues we revise our cost and revenue estimates and any revisions are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision first become known in connection with these and certain other contracts we may perform the work prior to when the services are billable andor payable pursuant to the contract the termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the value of products delivered and services performed in the event of an early termination 

for saas arrangements we evaluate whether the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and whether the customer can feasibly maintain the software on the customer’s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a thirdparty to host the software if we determine that the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and can feasibly maintain the software on the customer’s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a thirdparty to host the software we recognize the license professional services and hosting services revenues pursuant to asc 985605 software revenue recognition for saas arrangements that do not meet the criteria for recognition under asc 985605 we account for the elements under asc 60525 multiple element arrangements using all applicable facts and circumstances including whether i the element has standalone value ii there is a general right of return and iii the revenue is contingent on delivery of other elements we allocate the contract value to each element of the arrangement that qualifies for treatment as a separate element based on vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” and if vsoe is not available thirdparty evidence and if thirdparty evidence is unavailable estimated selling price for professional services associated with saas arrangements that we determine do not have standalone value to the customer or are contingent on delivery of other elements we recognize the services revenue ratably over the remaining contractual period once hosting has gone live and we may begin billing for the hosting services we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 

in connection with certain of our contracts we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet date many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period we review unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue in addition we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue which represents billings in excess of revenue earned the majority of this liability consists of maintenance billings for which payments are made in advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the maintenance period generally one year we also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit and the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product has not been met on a periodic basis we review by customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains appropriate 

intangible assets and goodwill  our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge the cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value with the excess allocated to goodwill accordingly we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets including software customer related intangibles trade name and goodwill these intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives we currently have no intangible assets with indefinite lives other than goodwill 

when testing goodwill for impairment quantitatively we first compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is performed to measure the amount of potential impairment in the second step we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized the fair values calculated in our impairment tests are determined using discounted cash flow models involving several assumptions the assumptions that are used are based upon what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and 

 

 

inherently uncertain we evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by comparing the total of the fair value of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed quantitatively during the second quarter of 2014 did not result in an impairment charge during 2014 we did not identify any triggering events that would require an update to our annual impairment review 

all intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of other intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows the assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved such indicators may include among others a significant decline in expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition and reductions in growth rates in addition products capabilities or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or noncompetitive any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets 

sharebased compensation we have a stock option plan that provides for the grant of stock options to key employees directors and nonemployee consultants we estimate the fair value of sharebased awards on the date of grant using the blackscholes option valuation model sharebased compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures which will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from such estimates changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data we estimate stock price volatility at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock estimated option life is determined using the weightedaverage period the stock options are expected to be outstanding based primarily on the options’ vesting terms remaining contractual life and the employees’ expected exercise based on historical patterns determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates 

 

 

analysis of results of operations and other 

the following discussion compares the historical results of operations on a basis consistent with gaap for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 

 



 

2014 compared to 2013 

revenues 

software licenses and royalties 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software licenses and royalties revenue for the years ended december 31 

 



 

software license and royalties revenue growth was mainly due to a more active marketplace as the result of improvement in local government economic conditions as well as our increasingly strong competitive position which we attribute in part to our increased investments in product development over the past few years an increase in the number of larger contracts in particular in the courts and justice market also contributed to the growth in license revenue 

 

the mix of new contracts between subscriptionbased and perpetual license arrangements can vary from quarter to quarter which can negatively impact our software license growth rate if a growing number of clients choose our subscriptionbased options rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangements subscriptionbased arrangements result in lower revenues in the initial year as compared to perpetual software license arrangements but generate higher overall subscriptionbased 

 

 

revenue over the term of the contract our new client mix in 2014 was approximately 74 selecting perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 26 selecting subscriptionbased arrangements compared to a client mix in 2013 of approximately 68 selecting perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 32 selecting subscriptionbased arrangements 138 new clients entered into subscriptionbased software arrangements in 2014 compared to 100 new clients in 2013 

subscriptions 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our subscriptions revenue for the years ended december 31 

 



 

subscriptionbased services revenue primarily consists of revenue derived from our saas arrangements which utilize the tyler private cloud as part of our subscriptionbased services we also provide electronic document filing solutions “efiling” that simplify the filing and management of court related documents for courts and law offices efiling revenue is derived from transaction fees and fixed fee arrangements 

subscriptionbased services revenue increased 42 compared to 2013 efiling services contributed approximately 133 million of the subscriptions revenue increase in 2014 most of the efiling revenue increase related to higher revenue from a contract with the texas office of court administration for our odyssey file and serve efiling system for texas courts “efiletexasgov” for civil court filings the state of texas has mandated all counties use efiletexasgov and this contract which took effect in september 2013 provided a recurring revenue stream that totaled 170 million in 2014 and is expected to total approximately 190 million in 2015 new saas clients as well as existing clients who converted to our saas model provided the remainder of the subscriptions revenue increase in 2014 we added 138 new saas clients and 59 existing clients elected to convert to our saas model 

software services  

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software services revenue for the years ended december 31 

 



 

software services revenue primarily consists of professional services billed in connection with installing our software converting client data training client personnel consulting and custom software development new clients who purchase our proprietary software licenses generally also contract with us to provide for the related software services existing clients also periodically purchase additional training consulting and minor programming services software services grew 22 in 2014 mainly due to much higher revenue from new proprietary software arrangements slightly higher rates on certain services and additions to our professional services staff which increased our capacity to deliver backlog 

maintenance 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our maintenance revenue for the years ended december 31 

 



 

 

 

we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and certain thirdparty software maintenance and support revenue increased mainly due to growth in our installed customer base from new software license sales as well as annual maintenance rate increases 

appraisal services  

the following table sets forth a comparison of our appraisal services revenue for the years ended december 31 

 



 

the appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states appraisal services revenue benefitted by the midyear addition of several new revaluation contracts in new york and the current appraisal cycle in indiana which began in july we expect appraisal revenue for 2015 will increase moderately compared to 2014 

cost of revenues and gross margins 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues for the years ended december 31 

 



 

the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the years ended december 31 

 



 

software licenses royalties and acquired software  costs of software licenses royalties and acquired software are primarily comprised of thirdparty software costs and amortization expense for acquired software we do not have any direct costs associated with royalties in 2014 our software licenses royalties and acquired software gross margin percentage increased compared to 2013 mainly due to higher revenues from proprietary software revenues which have a higher gross margin than thirdparty software 

software services maintenance and subscriptionbased services  cost of software services maintenance and subscriptionbased services primarily consists of personnel costs related to installing our software converting client data training client personnel and support activities and various other services such as saas arrangements and efiling maintenance and various other services such as saas costs typically grow at a slower rate than related revenue due to leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale the software services maintenance and subscriptions gross margin percentage increased mainly due to revenue from a contract with the texas office of court administration for efiletexasgov to manage efiling of court documents this contract began in september 2013 but we incurred initial startup costs in 2013 for which there were very limited related revenues the addition of revenue from this contract since the prior year accounted for most of the gross margin increase the gross margin increase was offset somewhat by costs related to accelerated hiring to ensure that we are wellpositioned to deliver our current backlog and anticipated new business our implementation development and support staff has increased by 215 employees since 2013 we expect our rate of hiring new implementation development and support staff in 2015 will be slower than 2014 

 

 

appraisal services  appraisal services revenue is approximately 4 of total revenue the appraisal services gross margin increased slightly compared to 2013 a high proportion of the costs of appraisal services revenue are variable as we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects whose term of employment generally ends with the projects’ completion 

our blended gross margin for 2014 increased 09 from 2013 the gross margin increase was mainly due to a revenue mix that included more software license revenue and subscription revenue and in particular increased revenue from efiling in texas this improvement in gross margin was offset somewhat by expenses associated with increased hiring of implementation development and support staff in order to expand our capacity to implement our contract backlog 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses consist primarily of salaries employee benefits travel sharebased compensation expense commissions and related overhead costs for administrative and sales and marketing employees as well as professional fees trade show activities advertising costs and other marketing related costs the following table sets forth a comparison of our sga expenses for the following years ended december 31 

 



 

sga as a percentage of revenue was 220 in 2014 compared to 236 in 2013 approximately onethird of the sga expense increase is from higher commission expense due to sales growth stock compensation expense contributed approximately onequarter of the increase primarily due to increases in our stock price the remaining increase consisted of higher bonuses related to operating results annual wage adjustments and increased travel related expenses 

research and development expense 

research and development expense consists primarily of salaries employee benefits and related overhead costs associated with product development the following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the years ended december 31 

 



 

research and development expense consist mainly of costs associated with development of new products and technologies from which we do not currently generate revenue as well as costs related to the ongoing development efforts for microsoft dynamics ax in 2007 we entered into a software development and license agreement which provided for a strategic alliance with microsoft corporation “microsoft” to jointly develop core public sector functionality for microsoft dynamics ax to address the accounting needs of public sector organizations worldwide this agreement and subsequent amendments granted microsoft intellectual property rights in the software code provided and developed by tyler into microsoft dynamics ax products to be marketed and sold outside of the public sector in exchange for reimbursement payments to partially offset the research and development costs and royalties on direct and indirect publicsector sales worldwide of the solutions codeveloped under this arrangement in addition tyler agreed to commit certain resources to the development of the next version of dynamics ax tyler also receives software and maintenance royalties on direct and indirect publicsector sales worldwide of the solutions codeveloped under this arrangement 

 

in 2014 research and development expense increased 11 compared to 2013 due to annual wage adjustments and efforts to maintain our competitive position we expect that research and development expense will increase in 2015 at a lower rate than our expected revenue growth

 

 

amortization of customer and trade name intangibles 

acquisition intangibles are comprised of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that is allocated to acquired software and customer and trade name intangibles the remaining excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues while amortization expense of customer and trade name intangibles is recorded as operating expense the estimated useful lives of both customer and trade name intangibles are five to 25 years the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the years ended december 31 

 



 

in 2014 we completed one acquisition that increased amortizable customer and trade name intangibles by approximately 10 million this amount is being amortized over a weighted average period of 12 years

 

estimated annual amortization expense relating to customer and trade name acquisition intangibles excluding acquired software for which the amortization expense is recorded as cost of revenues for the next five years is as follows in thousands 

 



 

other 

the following table sets forth a comparison of other expense net for the years ended december 31 

 



 

other expense is primarily comprised of interest expense nonusage and other fees associated with a revolving line of credit agreement that matured in august 2014 offset by interest income associated with invested cash balances interest expense declined compared to the prior year because we repaid all borrowings under the revolving credit agreement in early 2013 and had no debt outstanding during 2014 

income tax provision 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the years ended december 31 

 



 

the effective income tax rates were different from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of 35 due to state income taxes nondeductible sharebased compensation expense the qualified manufacturing activities deduction disqualifying incentive stock option dispositions and nondeductible meals and entertainment costs the qualified manufacturing activities deduction increased in 2014 contributing to a lower effective tax rate 

 

we experienced significant stock option exercise activity in 2014 and 2013 that generated excess tax benefits of 194 million and 282 million respectively excess tax benefits reduce tax payments but do not significantly reduce the effective tax rate and can result in limitations on other deductions in 2013 limitations resulting from excess tax benefits eliminated the qualified manufacturing activities deduction which negatively impacted our effective tax rate

 

 

2013 compared to 2012 

revenues 

software licenses and royalties 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software licenses and royalties revenue for the years ended december 31 

 



 

in 2012 we acquired two companies which provide financial and human capital management software solutions to the k12 education market and one company that provides enterprise permitting land management licensing and regulatory software solutions to government agencies excluding the impact of acquisitions total software licenses and royalties revenue increased 12 compared to 2012 approximately half of the growth was due to an increase of 23 million in royalties on sales of microsoft dynamics ax by other microsoft partners compared to the prior year royalty revenue is dependent upon sales volume from microsoft partners as well as the timing of maintenance renewals and can vary substantially from period to period software license revenues also grew 5 mainly due to increased investments in product development over the past few years however software license growth was reduced somewhat because of a growing number of clients choosing our subscriptionbased options rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement we had 100 new software clients that entered into subscriptionbased arrangements in 2013 compared to 76 new clients in 2012 

subscriptions 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our subscriptions revenue for the years ended december 31 

 



 

excluding the impact of acquisitions subscriptionbased services revenue increased 37 compared to 2012 new saas clients as well as existing clients who converted to our saas model provided the majority of the subscriptionbased revenue increase in 2013 we added 100 new clients and 63 existing clients elected to convert to our saas model efiling services also contributed approximately 50 million of the subscription revenue increase efiling revenue included 38 million related to a new contract with the texas office of court administration for our odyssey file and serve efiling system for texas courts which was implemented in september 2013 

software services  

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software services revenue for the years ended december 31 

 



 

excluding the impact of acquisitions software services increased 7 compared to 2012 the increase is attributable to growth in software license activity as well as contract arrangements that included more programming and other services 

 

 

maintenance  

the following table sets forth a comparison of our maintenance revenue for the years ended december 31 

 



 

excluding the impact of acquisitions maintenance revenue grew 9 from 2012 this increase was mainly due to growth in our installed customer base from new software license sales as well as maintenance rate increases 

appraisal services  

the following table sets forth a comparison of our appraisal services revenue for the years ended december 31 

 



 

appraisal services revenue declined 8 compared to 2012 the decline is mainly due to the completion in mid2012 of a large contract in pennsylvania 

cost of revenues and gross margins 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues for the years ended december 31 

 



 

the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the years ended december 31 

 



 

software licenses royalties and acquired software  in 2013 our software license gross margin percentage increased compared to 2012 due to higher revenues from royalties the margin also benefited from a product mix that included slightly more proprietary software revenues which have a higher gross margin than thirdparty software 

software services maintenance and subscriptionbased services  in 2013 the software services maintenance and subscriptions gross margin decreased compared to the prior year partly because we accelerated hiring in 2013 to ensure that we were wellpositioned to deliver our backlog and anticipated new business in addition software services maintenance and subscriptionbased services cost included initial startup costs related to the efiletexasgov contract this contract began in september 2013 but we incurred initial 

 

 

startup costs in 2013 for which there were very limited related revenue excluding the limited revenue and costs incurred in connection with implementing efiletexasgov in 2013 our software services maintenance and subscription services gross margin would have been approximately 428 our implementation and support staff increased by 202 employees since 2012 most of these additions occurred midto late 2013 

appraisal services  the appraisal services gross margin declined slightly compared to 2012 a high proportion of the costs of appraisal services revenue are variable as we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects whose term of employment generally ends with the projects’ completion 

our blended gross margin for 2013 increased 02 from 2012 mainly due to higher royalty revenue and also benefited from a product mix that included slightly higher proprietary software revenues than thirdparty software costs incurred related to our implementation of efiletexasgov with minimal related revenues as well as increased hiring of implementation and support staff in order to expand our capacity to implement our contract backlog offset some of the positive impact of higher royalty and proprietary software revenue 

selling general and administrative expenses 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our sga expenses for the following years ended december 31 

 



 

sga as a percentage of revenues was 236 in 2013 compared to 239 in 2012 excluding costs from acquisitions almost half of the sga expense increase is due to increased stock compensation expense resulting from increases in our stock price and higher payroll taxes associated with increased stock option exercise activity commission expense has also increased compared to the prior year periods due to higher sales 

research and development expense 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the years ended december 31 

 



 

our research and development expense increased 31 million in 2013 compared to 2012 in 2013 we did not have any research and development expense offsets earned under the terms of our agreement with microsoft compared to 10 million in research and development expense offsets in 2012 

amortization of customer and trade name intangibles 

the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the years ended december 31 

 



 

 

 

other 

the following table sets forth a comparison of other expense net for the years ended december 31 

 



 

other expense is primarily comprised of interest expense nonusage and other fees associated with a revolving line of credit agreement interest expense was lower in 2013 than 2012 because we maintained higher debt levels in 2012 associated primarily with several acquisitions completed from october 2011 through november 2012 

income tax provision 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the years ended december 31 

 



 

the effective income tax rates were different from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of 35 due to state income taxes nondeductible sharebased compensation expense the qualified manufacturing activities deduction disqualifying incentive stock option dispositions and nondeductible meals and entertainment costs we experienced significant stock option exercise activity in 2013 that generated 282 million excess tax benefits excess tax benefits reduce tax payments but do not significantly reduce the effective tax rate and can result in limitations on other deductions in 2013 limitations resulting from excess tax benefits eliminated the qualified manufacturing activities deduction which negatively impacted our effective tax rate 

 

 

financial condition and liquidity 

as of december 31 2014 we had cash and cash equivalents of 2062 million compared to 789 million at december 31 2013 cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with several domestic banks as of december 31 2014 we had no outstanding borrowings and an outstanding letter of credit totaling 20 million we do not believe this letter of credit will be required to be drawn upon we believe that cash from operating activities cash on hand and access to the credit markets provides us with sufficient flexibility to meet our longterm financial needs 

 

the following table sets forth a summary of cash flows for the years ended december 31 

 



 

net cash provided by operating activities continues to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures other potential capital resources include cash on hand public and private issuances of debt or equity securities and bank borrowings it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets in the future may be limited by economic conditions or other factors we currently believe that cash provided by operating activities cash on hand and access to the credit markets are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures income tax obligations and share repurchases for at least the next twelve months 

in 2014 operating activities provided net cash of 1234 million primarily generated from net income of 589 million noncash depreciation and amortization charges of 146 million and noncash sharebased compensation expense of 148 million cash from operations also benefited from timing of payments on vendor invoices and income tax liabilities in addition deferred revenue balances were higher than 2013 mainly due to an increase in annual software maintenance billings as a result of growth in our installed 

 

 

customer base and growth in subscriptionbased arrangements these increases in liabilities were offset somewhat by higher accounts receivable balances from annual software maintenance billings and prepaid commissions on large contracts 

in general changes in the balance of deferred revenue are cyclical and primarily driven by the timing of our maintenance renewal billings our renewal dates occur throughout the year but our heaviest renewal cycles occur in the second and fourth quarters 

at december 31 2014 our days sales outstanding “dsos” were 80 days compared to dsos of 87 days at december 31 2013 dsos are calculated based on accounts receivable excluding longterm receivables but including unbilled receivables divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by 360 days  

investing activities used cash of 116 million in 2014 compared to 257 million in 2013 in 2014 we completed the acquisition of softcode inc for a purchase price of 35 million in cash of which 325000 was accrued at december 31 2014 and 16540 shares of tyler common stock valued at 15 million the remaining use of cash in 2014 was comprised primarily of capital expenditures related to computer equipment furniture and fixtures in support of internal growth particularly with respect to growth in our cloudbased offerings investing activities in 2013 and 2012 included 203 million and 23 million respectively paid in connection with the construction of an office building in plano texas these expenditures were funded from cash generated from operations and cash on hand

financing activities in 2014 provided cash of 154 million compared to 320 million in 2013 financing activities in 2014 were comprised of collections of 188 million from stock option exercises and contributions from the employee stock purchase plan and 194 million excess tax benefit from exercises of sharebased arrangements these increases were offset somewhat by purchases of 294000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 228 million financing activities in 2013 were comprised of collections of 218 million from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan activity and 282 million excess tax benefit from exercises of sharebased arrangements offset partially by 180 million in net payments on our revolving line of credit cash used in financing activities in 2012 was mainly comprised of 427 million in payments on our revolving line of credit offset by collections of 151 million from stock option exercises and contributions from the employee stock purchase plan and 88 million excess tax benefit from exercises of sharebased arrangements 

the share repurchase program which was approved by our board of directors was announced in october 2002 and was amended at various times from 2003 through 2011 as of december 31 2014 we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to 14 million additional shares of our common stock our share repurchase program allows us to repurchase shares at our discretion and market conditions influence the timing of the buybacks and the number of shares repurchased as well as the volume of employee stock option exercises share repurchases are generally funded using our existing cash balances and may occur through open market purchases and transactions structured through investment banking institutions privately negotiated transactions andor other mechanisms there is no expiration date specified for the authorization and we intend to repurchase stock under the plan from time to time 

in 2014 we issued 855000 shares of common stock and received 147 million in aggregate proceeds upon exercise of stock options in 2013 we issued 14 million shares of common stock and received 183 million in aggregate proceeds upon exercise of stock options in 2012 we issued 12 million shares of common stock and received 124 million in aggregate proceeds upon exercise of stock options in 2014 2013 and 2012 we received 41 million 35 million and 26 million respectively from contributions to the tyler technologies inc employee stock purchase plan 

we did not replace our revolving credit line of 1500 million that matured on august 11 2014 

as of december 31 2014 we had an outstanding 20 million letter of credit issued by a bank in favor of one of our clients the letter of credit guarantees our performance under a software contract and expires in 2015 we do not believe this letter of credit will be required to be drawn upon 

we paid income taxes net of refunds received of 102 million in 2014 93 million in 2013 and 131 million in 2012 we experienced significant stock option exercise activity in 2014 that generated 194 million excess tax benefits excess tax benefits reduce tax payments but do not significantly reduce the effective tax rate and can result in limitations on other deductions in 2013 and 2012 excess tax benefits were 282 million and 88 million respectively 

 

 

 

on february 4 2015 we announced that our contractual research and development commitment to develop public sector functionality for microsoft dynamics ax expires with the release of dynamics ax 7 we do not anticipate continuing research and development commitment although we will continue to provide sustained engineering and technical support for the public sector functionality within dynamics ax we do not expect the expiration of this development commitment to materially impact operating results in 2015 we anticipate that license and maintenance royalties for all applicable domestic and international sales of dynamics ax to public sector entities will continue under the terms of the contract

on january 30 2015 we made a 150 million investment in convertible preferred stock representing a 20 interest in record holdings pty limited a privately held australian company specializing in digitizing the spoken word in court and legal settings 

excluding acquisitions we anticipate that 2015 capital spending will be between 135 million and 145 million we expect the majority of this capital spending will consist of computer equipment and software for infrastructure replacements and expansion we currently do not expect to capitalize significant amounts related to software development in 2015 but the actual amount and timing of those costs and whether they are capitalized or expensed may result in additional capitalized software development capital spending is expected to be funded from existing cash balances and cash flows from operations 

from time to time we engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates in order to pursue such opportunities which could require significant commitments of capital we may be required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive securities in the future no assurance can be given as to our future acquisition opportunities and how such opportunities will be financed 

we lease office facilities as well as transportation computer and other equipment used in our operations under noncancelable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through 2021 most leases contain renewal options and some contain purchase options 

summarized in the table below are our obligations to make future payments under our longterm lease obligations at december 31 2014 in thousands

 item 1 business tableend description of business 

tyler technologies inc “tyler” is a major provider of integrated information management solutions and services for the public sector with a focus on local governments we partner with clients to make local government more accessible to the public more responsive to the needs of citizens and more efficient in its operations we have a broad line of software solutions and services to address the information technology “it” needs of major areas of operations for cities counties schools and other local government entities most of our customers have our software installed inhouse for customers who prefer not to physically acquire the software and hardware most of our software applications can be delivered as software as a service “saas” which utilize the tyler private cloud we provide professional it services to our customers including software and hardware installation data conversion training and at times product modifications in addition we are the nation’s largest provider of outsourced property appraisal services for taxing jurisdictions we also provide continuing customer support services to ensure product performance and reliability which provides us with longterm customer relationships and a significant base of recurring maintenance revenue in 2010 we began providing electronic document filing solutions “efiling” which simplify the filing and management of court related documents 

tyler was founded in 1966 prior to 1998 we operated as a diversified industrial conglomerate with operations in various industrial retail and distribution businesses all of which have been divested in 1997 we embarked on a multiphase growth plan focused on serving the specialized information management needs of local governments nationwide in 1998 and 1999 we entered the local government it market through a series of strategic acquisitions 

market overview 

the state and local government market is one of the largest and most decentralized it markets in the country consisting of all 50 states approximately 3000 counties 36000 cities and towns and 13900 school districts this market is also comprised of approximately 37000 special districts and other agencies each with specialized delegated responsibilities and unique information management requirements 

traditionally local government bodies and agencies performed statemandated duties including property assessment record keeping road maintenance law enforcement administration of election and judicial functions and the provision of welfare assistance today a host of emerging and urgent issues are confronting local governments each of which demands a service response these areas include criminal justice and corrections administration and finance public safety health and human services and public works transfers of responsibility from the federal and state governments to county and municipal governments and agencies in these and other areas also place additional service and financial requirements on these local government units in addition constituents of local governments are increasingly demanding improved service and better access to information from public entities as a result local governments recognize the increasing value of information management systems and services to among other things improve revenue collection provide increased access to information and streamline delivery of services to their constituents local government bodies are now recognizing that “egovernment” is an additional responsibility for community development from integrated tax systems to integrated civil and criminal justice information systems many counties and cities have benefited significantly from the implementation of jurisdictionwide systems that allow different agencies or government offices to share data and provide a more comprehensive approach to information management many city and county governmental agencies also have unique individual information management requirements which must be tailored to the specific functions of each particular office 

many local governments also have difficulties attracting and retaining the staff necessary to support their it functions as a result they seek to establish longterm relationships with reliable providers of high quality it products and services such as tyler 

although local governments generally face budgetary constraints in their operations their primary revenue sources are usually property taxes and to a lesser extent utility billings and other fees which historically tend to be relatively stable in addition the acquisition of new technology typically enables local governments to operate more efficiently and often provides a measurable return on investment that justifies the purchase of software and related services 

gartner estimates that state and local government application and vertical specific software spending will grow from 101 billion in 2014 to 115 billion in 2017 the professional services and support segments of the market where our business is primarily focused is expected to expand from 347 billion in 2014 to 373 billion in 2017 application and vertical specific software sales in the primary and secondary education segments of the market is expected to expand from 17 billion in 2014 to 22 billion in 2017 while professional services and support are expected to grow from 23 billion in 2014 to 26 billion in 2017 

 

products and services 

we provide a comprehensive and flexible suite of products and services that addresses the information technology needs of cities counties schools and other local government entities we derive our revenues from five primary sources 

 

  

  

  

  

 we design develop and market a broad range of software solutions to serve missioncritical “backoffice” functions of local governments many of our software applications include internetaccessible solutions that allow for realtime public access to a variety of information or that allow the public to transact business with local governments via the internet our software solutions and services are generally grouped in three major areas 

 

  

  

 each of our core software systems consists of several fully integrated applications for customers who acquire the software for use inhouse we generally license our systems under standard perpetual license agreements that provide the customer with a fully paid nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software in some of the product areas such as financial management and education and property appraisal and tax we offer multiple solutions designed to meet the needs of different sized governments 

we also offer saas arrangements which utilize the tyler private cloud for customers who do not wish to maintain update and operate these systems or to make upfront capital expenditures to implement these advanced technologies for these customers we deliver our software using the saas model — the software and client data are hosted at our data centers or at thirdparty locations and customers typically sign multiyear contracts for these subscriptionbased services 

historically we have had a greater proportion of our annual revenues in the second half of our fiscal year due to governmental budget and spending cycles and the timing of system implementations for customers desiring to “go live” at the beginning of the calendar year

subscriptionbased services 

subscriptionbased revenue is primarily derived from our saas arrangements which utilize the tyler private cloud as well as our transaction based offerings such as efiling solutions 

we are able to provide the majority of our software products through our saas model the customers who choose this model typically do not wish to maintain update and operate these systems or make upfront capital expenditures to implement these advanced technologies the contract terms for these arrangements range from one to 10 years but are typically contracted for a period of three to six years the majority of our saas or hosting arrangements include additional professional services as well as maintenance and support services in certain arrangements the customer may also acquire a license to the software 

as part of our subscriptionbased services we provide efiling solutions that simplify the filing and management of court related documents for courts and law offices revenues for efiling are included in subscriptionbased revenues and are derived from transaction fees and in some cases fixed fee arrangements 

software services 

we provide a variety of professional it services to customers who utilize our software products virtually all of our customers contract with us for installation training and data conversion services in connection with their purchase of tyler’s software solutions the complete implementation process for a typical system includes planning design data conversion setup and testing at the culmination of the implementation process an installation team travels to the customer’s facility to ensure the smooth transfer of data to the new system installation fees are charged separately to customers on either a fixedfee or hourly charge basis depending on the contract

virtually all of our software customers contract with us for maintenance and support which provides us with a significant source of recurring revenue we generally provide maintenance and support under annual contracts with a typical fee based on a percentage of the software product’s license fee these fees can be increased annually and may also increase as new license fees increase maintenance and support fees are generally paid in advance for the entire maintenance contract period most maintenance contracts automatically renew unless the customer or tyler gives notice of termination prior to expiration similar support is provided to our saas customers and is included in their subscription fees which are classified as subscriptionbased revenues 

appraisal services 

we are the nation’s largest provider of property appraisal outsourcing services for local government taxing authorities these services include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 local government taxing authorities normally reappraise properties from time to time to update values for tax assessment purposes and to maintain equity in the taxing process in some jurisdictions reassessment cycles are mandated by law in others they are discretionary while some taxing jurisdictions perform reappraisals inhouse many local governments outsource this function because of its cyclical nature and because of the specialized knowledge and expertise requirements associated with it our appraisal services business unit has been in this business since 1938 

in some instances we also sell property tax andor appraisal software products in connection with appraisal outsourcing projects while other customers may only engage us to provide appraisal services appraisal outsourcing services are somewhat seasonal in nature to the extent that winter weather conditions reduce the productivity of data collection activities in connection with those projects 

strategy 

our objective is to grow our revenue and earnings internally supplemented by focused strategic acquisitions the key components of our business strategy are to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

sales marketing and customers 

we market our products and services through direct sales and marketing personnel located throughout the united states other inhouse sales staff focus on addon sales professional services and support 

sales of new systems are typically generated from referrals from other government offices or departments within a county or municipality referrals from other local governments relationships established between sales representatives and county or local officials contacts at trade shows direct mailings and direct contact from prospects already familiar with us we are active in numerous national state county and local government associations and participate in annual meetings trade shows and educational events 

customers consist primarily of county and municipal agencies school districts and other local government offices in counties customers include the auditor treasurer tax assessorcollector county clerk district clerk county and district court judges probation officers sheriff and county appraiser at municipal government sites customers include directors from various departments including administration finance utilities public works code enforcement personnel purchasing taxation municipal court and police contracts for software products and services are generally implemented over periods of three months to one year with annually renewing maintenance and support update agreements thereafter although either the customer or we can terminate these agreements historically almost all support and maintenance agreements are automatically renewed annually contracts for appraisal outsourcing services are generally one to three years in duration during 2013 approximately 46 of our revenue was attributable to ongoing support and maintenance agreements 

competition 

we compete with numerous local regional and national firms that provide or offer some or many of the same solutions and services that we provide many of these competitors are smaller companies that may be able to offer less expensive solutions than ours many of these firms operate within a specific geographic area andor in a narrow product or service niche we also compete with national firms some of which have greater financial and technical resources than we do including oracle corporation infor lawson sap ag affiliated computer services inc a unit of xerox corporation sungard data systems inc thomson reuters corporation new world systems american cadastre llc amcad and constellation software inc in addition we sometimes compete with consulting and systems integration firms which develop custom systems primarily for larger governments we also occasionally compete with central internal information service departments of local governments which require us to persuade the enduser department to discontinue service by its own personnel and outsource the service to us 

we compete on a variety of factors including price service name recognition reputation technological capabilities and the ability to modify existing products and services to accommodate the individual requirements of the customer our ability to offer an integrated system of applications for several offices or departments is often a competitive advantage local governmental units often are required to seek competitive proposals through a request for proposal process and some prospective clients use consultants to assist them with the proposal and vendor selection process 

suppliers 

substantially all of the computers peripherals printers scanners operating system software office automation software and other equipment necessary for the implementation and provision of our software systems and services are presently available from several thirdparty sources hardware is purchased on original equipment manufacturer or distributor terms at discounts from retail we have not experienced any significant supply problems 

backlog 

at december 31 2013 our estimated revenue backlog was approximately 5517 million compared to 3806 million at december 31 2012 the backlog represents signed contracts under which the revenue has not been recognized as of yearend approximately 3110 million or 56 of the backlog is expected to be recognized during 2014 

 

intellectual property proprietary rights and licenses 

we regard certain features of our internal operations software and documentation as confidential and proprietary and rely on a combination of contractual restrictions trade secret laws and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property we generally do not rely on patents we believe that due to the rapid rate of technological change in the computer software industry trade secrets and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as knowledge ability and experience of our employees frequent product enhancements and timeliness and quality of support services we typically license our software products under nonexclusive license agreements which are generally nontransferable and have a perpetual term 

employees 

at december 31 2013 we had 2573 employees appraisal outsourcing projects are cyclical in nature and can be widely dispersed geographically we often hire temporary employees to assist in these projects whose term of employment generally ends with the project’s completion none of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to collective bargaining agreements we consider our relations with our employees to be positive

risks associated with selling products and services into the public sector marketplace 

a prolonged economic slowdown could harm our operations 

a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce demand for our software products and services local and state governments may face financial pressures that could in turn affect our growth rate and profitability in 2014 and beyond there is no assurance that local and state spending levels will be unaffected by declining or stagnant general economic conditions and if budget shortfalls occur they may negatively impact local and state information technology spending and could have a material adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition 

 

 

selling products and services into the public sector poses unique challenges 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of software and services to state county and city governments other municipal agencies and other public entities we expect that sales to public sector customers will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues in the future we face many risks and challenges associated with contracting with governmental entities including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 each of these risks is outside our control if we fail to adequately adapt to these risks and uncertainties our financial performance could be adversely affected 

a decline in the demand for information technology spending may result in a decrease in our revenues or lower our growth rate 

a decline in the demand for information technology among our current and prospective customers may result in decreased revenues or a lower growth rate for us because our sales depend in part on our customers’ level of funding for new or additional information technology systems and services moreover demand for our solutions may be reduced by a decline in overall demand for computer software and services accordingly we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase or maintain our revenues 

the open bidding process for governmental contracts creates uncertainty in predicting future contract awards 

many governmental agencies purchase products and services through an open bidding process generally a governmental entity will publish an established list of requirements requesting potential vendors to propose solutions for the established requirements to respond successfully to these requests for proposals we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract the time required to establish operations for the proposed client and the likely terms of any other third party proposals submitted we cannot guarantee that we will win any bids in the future through the request for proposal process or that any winning bids will ultimately result in contracts on favorable terms our failure to secure contracts through the open bidding process or to secure such contracts on favorable terms may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we face significant competition from other vendors and potential new entrants into our markets 

we believe we are a leading provider of integrated solutions for the public sector however we face competition from a variety of software vendors that offer products and services similar to those offered by us as well as from companies offering to develop custom software we compete on the basis of a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe the market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors that vary in size primary computer platforms and overall product scope our competitors include consulting firms publicly held companies that focus on selected segments of the public sector market and a significant number of smaller privately held companies certain competitors have greater technical marketing and financial resources than we do we cannot assure you that such competitors will not develop products or offer services that are superior to our products or services or that achieve greater market acceptance 

we also compete with internal centralized information service departments of governmental entities which require us to persuade the enduser to stop the internal service and outsource to us in addition our customers may elect in the future to provide information management services internally through new or existing departments which could reduce the market for our services 

we could face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the public sector software application market and new products and technologies are introduced increased competition could result in pricing pressure fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share in addition current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with thirdparties thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share further competitive pressures could require us to reduce the price of our software licenses and related services we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition 

fixed price contracts may affect our profits 

some of our present contracts are on a fixedpriced basis which can lead to various risks including 

 

  

  

 if we do not adequately assess these and other risks we may be subject to cost overruns and penalties which may harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

changes in the insurance markets may affect our ability to win some contract awards and may lead to increased expenses 

some of our customers primarily those for our property appraisal services require that we secure performance bonds before they will select us as their vendor in addition we have in the past been required to provide letters of credit as security for the issuance of a performance bond our current credit facility contains a 250 million sublimit for letters of credit we cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure such performance bonds in the future on terms that are favorable to us if at all our inability to obtain performance bonds on favorable terms or at all could impact our future ability to win some contract awards particularly large property appraisal services contracts which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

volatility in the stock markets increasing shareholder litigation the adoption of expansive legislation that redefines corporate controls in particular legislation adopted to prevent future corporate and accounting scandals as well as other factors have at times led to volatility in premiums for directors’ and officers’ liability insurance volatility of the insurance market may result in future increases in our general and administrative expenses which may adversely affect future operating results 

risks associated with our periodic results and stock price 

as with other software vendors we may be required to delay revenue recognition into future periods which could adversely impact our operating results 

we have in the past had to and in the future may have to defer revenue recognition for license fees due to several factors including whether 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 because of the factors listed above and other specific requirements under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states for software revenue recognition we must have very precise terms in our license agreements in order to recognize revenue when we initially deliver and install software or perform services negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions can extend the sales cycle and sometimes we do not obtain terms and conditions that permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery or even as work on the project is completed 

we may experience fluctuations in quarterly revenue that could adversely impact our stock price and our operating results 

our actual revenues in a quarter could fall below expectations which could lead to a decline in our stock price our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter revenues from license fees in any quarter depend substantially upon our contracting activity and our ability to recognize revenues in that quarter in accordance with our revenue recognition policies our quarterly revenue may fluctuate and may be difficult to forecast for a variety of reasons including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 fluctuation in our quarterly revenues may adversely affect our operating results in each fiscal quarter our expense levels operating costs and hiring plans are based to some extent on projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed if our actual revenues fall below expectations we could experience a reduction in operating results 

increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins and adversely affect our operating results 

we realize lower margins on software and appraisal service revenues than on license revenue the majority of our contracts include both software licenses and professional services therefore an increase in the percentage of software service and appraisal service revenue compared to license revenue could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and could adversely affect operating results 

our stock price may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and may be significantly affected by many different factors some examples of factors that can have a significant impact on our stock price include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for the common stock of technology companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company we cannot assure you that similar litigation will not occur in the future with respect to us such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition 

financial outlook 

from time to time in press releases and otherwise we may publish forecasts or other forwardlooking statements regarding our results including estimated revenues or net earnings any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties and as a matter of course any number of them may prove to be incorrect further the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors including those described in this discussion many of which are beyond our control as a result we cannot be certain that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse current and potential stockholders are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions but instead are encouraged to utilize our entire publicly available mix of historical and forwardlooking information as well as other available information regarding us our products and services and the software industry when evaluating our prospective results of operations 

 

risks associated with our software products 

our products are complex and we run the risk of errors or defects with new product introductions or enhancements 

software products as complex as those developed by us may contain errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released although we have not experienced material adverse effects resulting from any such defects or errors to date we cannot assure you that material defects and errors will not be found after commencement of product shipments any such defects could result in loss of revenues or delay market acceptance 

our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims it is possible however that we may not always be able to negotiate such provisions in our contracts with customers or that the limitation of liability provisions contained in our license agreements may not be effective as a result of existing or future federal state or local laws ordinances or judicial decisions although we maintain errors and omissions and general liability insurance and we try to structure our contracts to include limitations on liability we cannot assure you that a successful claim could not be made or would not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we must respond to rapid technological changes to be competitive 

the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards in computer hardware and software technology changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result our future success will depend in part upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products and develop and introduce in a timely manner or acquire new products that keep pace with technological developments satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and costeffective manner further we cannot assure you that the products capabilities or technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive if we are unable to develop or acquire on a timely and costeffective basis new software products or enhancements to existing products or if such new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance our business operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights 

many of our product and service offerings incorporate proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of contracts copyrights and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology we cannot be certain that we have taken all appropriate steps to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property in addition there has been significant litigation in the united states in recent years involving intellectual property rights we are not currently involved in any material intellectual property litigation we may however be a party to intellectual property litigation in the future to protect our proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights further we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us in the future with respect to current or future products any claims or litigation with or without merit could be timeconsuming and result in costly litigation and diversion of management’s attention further any claims and litigation could cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements such royalty or licensing arrangements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all thus litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations regardless of the final outcome of such litigation 

we generally grant our customers fully paid perpetual licenses to use our software applications and customers may elect to terminate our maintenance contracts and manage operations internally 

it is possible that governments and their successors and affiliates may elect to not renew maintenance contracts for our software trying instead to maintain and operate the software themselves using their right of use license rights to the software programs and other applications we have developed for them in their operations excluding software applications that we provide on a softwareasaservice basis this could adversely affect our revenues and profits additionally they may inadvertently allow our intellectual property or other information to fall into the hands of third parties including our competitors 

 

we cannot fully protect client information from security breaches 

as a provider of hosted services we receive maintain process and transmit confidential information on behalf of our clients and other authorized users there is no guarantee that the systems and procedures that we maintain to protect against unauthorized access to such information are adequate to protect against loss destruction computer breakins theft or other improper activity that could jeopardize the security of such information for which we are responsible any such lapse in security could expose us to litigation loss of customers harm our business reputation and otherwise cause a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

hosting services for some of our products are dependent upon the uninterrupted operation of data centers 

a material portion of our business is provided through hosting services of some of our software products these hosting services depend on the uninterrupted operation of data centers and the ability to protect computer equipment and information stored in these data centers against damage that may be caused by natural disaster fire power loss telecommunications or internet failure unauthorized intrusion computer viruses and other similar damaging events if any of our data centers were to become inoperable for an extended period we might be unable to provide our customers with contracted services although we take what we believe to be reasonable precautions against such occurrences we can give no assurance that damaging events such as these will not result in a prolonged interruption of our services which could result in customer dissatisfaction loss of revenue and damage to our business 

material portions of our business require the internet infrastructure to be further developed or adequately maintained 

the internet has experienced and is expected to continue to experience significant growth in the number of users and amount of traffic if the web continues to experience increased numbers of users frequency of use or increased bandwidth requirements the internet infrastructure may not be able to support these increased demands or perform reliably the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure and could face such outages and delays in the future these outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage and traffic on our government portals such outages and delays would also hinder our customers’ ability to complete online transactions in addition the internet could lose its viability due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased levels of activity or due to increased governmental regulation if the internet infrastructure is not adequately further developed or maintained use of our government portals and our citizentogovernment and businesstogovernment services may be reduced 

part of our future success depends on the use of the internet as a means to access public information and perform transactions electronically including for example electronic filing of court documents this in part requires the further development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure if this infrastructure fails to be further developed or be adequately maintained our business would be harmed because users may not be able to access our government portals among other things this further development and maintenance will require a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed data capacity security and timely development of complementary products for providing reliable internet access and services 

risks associated with our growth strategy and other general corporate risks 

we may experience difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy 

a significant portion of our growth has resulted from strategic acquisitions in new product and geographic markets although our focus is on internal growth we will continue to identify and pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances with suitable candidates our future success will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate future acquisitions and other strategic alliances into our operations acquisitions may involve a number of special risks including diversion of management’s attention failure to retain key acquired personnel unanticipated events or circumstances legal liabilities and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we conduct due diligence reviews of potential acquisition candidates we may not identify all material liabilities or risks related to acquisition candidates there can be no assurance that any such strategic acquisitions or alliances will be accomplished on favorable terms or will result in profitable operations 

our failure to properly manage growth could adversely affect our business 

we have expanded our operations since 1998 when we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector we intend to continue expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities this growth places a significant demand on management and operational resources in order to manage growth effectively we must implement 

 

and improve our operational systems procedures and controls on a timely basis we must also identify hire train and manage key managerial and technical personnel if we fail to implement these systems or employ and retain such qualified personnel our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to hire integrate and retain qualified personnel 

our continued success will depend upon the availability and performance of our key management sales marketing customer support and product development personnel the loss of key management or technical personnel could adversely affect us we believe that our continued success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract integrate and retain such personnel we have at times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel competition for qualified software development sales and other personnel is intense and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 new securities and exchange commission regulations and new york stock exchange rules are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours the costs required to comply with such evolving laws are difficult to predict to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards this investment may result in an unforeseen increase in general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenuegenerating activities which may harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

historically we have not paid dividends on our common stock 

we have not declared or paid a cash dividend since we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector in 1998 additionally our bank credit agreement contains restrictions on the payment of cash dividends we intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law could deter takeover attempts 

our board of directors may issue up to 1000000 shares of preferred stock and may determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting and conversion rights of these shares of preferred stock these determinations may be made without any further vote or action by our stockholders the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock in addition some provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and of the delaware general corporation law could also delay prevent or make more difficult a merger tender offer or proxy contest involving us

we monitor and analyze several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance these indicators include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 outlook 

we expect the trend of gradual improvements in the marketplace to continue in 2014 we have made significant investments in our business that we believe will enhance our market leadership and improve longterm revenue and margin growth 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements the reported amounts of revenues cost of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosure of contingencies the notes to the financial statements included as part of this annual report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the application of the percentageofcompletion and proportional performance methods of revenue recognition the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of intangible assets determination of sharebased compensation expense and valuation allowance for receivables we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards codification “asc” 605 revenue recognition and asc 985605 software revenue recognition our revenues are derived from sales of software licenses and royalties subscriptionbased services appraisal services maintenance and support and services that typically range from 

 

installation training and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs for multiple element software arrangements which do not entail the performance of services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software we generally record revenue when the delivered products or performed services result in a legally enforceable and nonrefundable claim we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized because most of our customers are governmental entities we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments in a limited number of cases we encounter a customer who is dissatisfied with some aspect of the software product or our service and we may offer a “concession” to such customer in those limited situations where we grant a concession we rarely reduce the contract arrangement fee but alternatively may perform additional services such as additional training or creating additional custom reports these amounts have historically been nominal in connection with our customer contracts and the adequacy of related allowances and measures of progress towards contract completion our project managers are charged with the responsibility to continually review the status of each customer on a specific contract basis also we review on at least a quarterly basis significant past due accounts receivable and the adequacy of related reserves events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments may require revision include but are not limited to deterioration of a customer’s financial condition failure to manage our customer’s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products 

we use contract accounting primarily the percentageofcompletion method as discussed in asc 60535 construction – type and certain production – type contracts for those software arrangements that involve significant production modification or customization of the software or where our software services are otherwise considered essential to the functionality of the software we measure progresstocompletion primarily using labor hours incurred or value added in addition we recognize revenue using the proportional performance method of revenue recognition for our property appraisal projects some of which can range up to five years these methods rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue billings and collections and expected contract costs as well as measures of progress toward completion we believe reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs and progress applicable to various stages of a contract can be made at times we perform additional andor noncontractual services for little to no incremental fee to satisfy customer expectations if changes occur in delivery productivity or other factors used in developing our estimates of expected costs or revenues we revise our cost and revenue estimates and any revisions are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision first become known in connection with these and certain other contracts we may perform the work prior to when the services are billable andor payable pursuant to the contract the termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the value of products delivered and services performed in the event of an early termination 

for saas arrangements we evaluate whether the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and whether the customer can feasibly maintain the software on the customer’s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a third party to host the software if we determine that the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and can feasibly maintain the software on the customer’s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a third party to host the software we recognize the license professional services and hosting services revenues pursuant to asc 985605 software revenue recognition for saas arrangements that do not meet the criteria for recognition under asc 985605 we account for the elements under asc 60525 multiple element arrangements using all applicable facts and circumstances including whether i the element has standalone value ii there is a general right of return and iii the revenue is contingent on delivery of other elements we allocate the contract value to each element of the arrangement that qualifies for treatment as a separate element based on vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” and if vsoe is not available third party evidence and if third party evidence is unavailable estimated selling price for professional services associated with saas arrangements that we determine do not have standalone value to the customer or are contingent on delivery of other elements we recognize the services revenue ratably over the remaining contractual period once hosting has gone live and we may begin billing for the hosting services we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 

in connection with certain of our contracts we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet date many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period we review unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue in addition we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue which represents billings in excess of revenue earned the majority of this liability consists of maintenance billings for which payments are made in advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the maintenance period generally one year we also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit and the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product has not been met on a periodic basis we review by customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains appropriate 

 

intangible assets and goodwill  our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge the cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value with the excess allocated to goodwill accordingly we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets including software customer related intangibles trade name and goodwill these intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives we currently have no intangible assets with indefinite lives other than goodwill 

when testing goodwill for impairment quantitatively we first compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is performed to measure the amount of potential impairment in the second step we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized the fair values calculated in our impairment tests are determined using discounted cash flow models involving several assumptions the assumptions that are used are based upon what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain we evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by comparing the total of the fair value of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed quantitatively during the second quarter of 2013 did not result in an impairment charge during 2013 we did not identify any triggering events which would require an update to our annual impairment review 

all intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of other intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows the assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved such indicators may include among others a significant decline in expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition and reductions in growth rates in addition products capabilities or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or noncompetitive any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets 

sharebased compensation we have a stock option plan that provides for the grant of stock options to key employees directors and nonemployee consultants we estimate the fair value of sharebased awards on the date of grant using the blackscholes option valuation model sharebased compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures which will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from such estimates changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data we estimate stock price volatility at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock estimated option life is determined using the weightedaverage period the stock options are expected to be outstanding based primarily on the options’ vesting terms remaining contractual life and the employees’ expected exercise based on historical patterns determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates

excluding the impact of acquisitions subscriptionbased services revenue increased 37 compared to 2012 new saas customers as well as existing customers who converted to our saas model provided the majority of the subscriptionbased revenue increase in 2013 we added 100 new customers and 63 existing customers elected to convert to our saas model efiling services also contributed approximately 50 million of the subscription revenue increase efiling revenue included 38 million related to a new contract with the texas office of court administration for our odyssey file and serve efiling system for texas courts “efile texasgov” which was implemented in september 2013 this contract is a fixed fee arrangement and we expect it will provide a longterm recurring revenue stream of 17 million to 19 million annually when efiling becomes mandatory in texas in 2014 the remaining efiling revenue increase is mainly the result of existing clients expanding mandatory efiling for court documents

 appraisal services revenue declined 8 in 2013 compared to 2012 the appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states the decline is mainly due to the completion in mid2012 of a large contract in pennsylvania we expect appraisal revenues for 2014 will increase slightly compared to 2013

software services maintenance and subscriptionbased services  cost of software services maintenance and subscriptionbased services primarily consists of personnel costs related to installation of our software conversion of customer data training customer personnel and support activities and various other services such as saas arrangements and efiling maintenance and various other services such as saas costs typically grow at a slower rate than related revenues due to leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale however we accelerated hiring in 2013 to ensure that we were wellpositioned to deliver our current backlog and anticipated new business in late 2012 we signed a contract with the texas office of court administration for efiletexasgov to manage efiling of court documents in early 2013 the state of texas issued an order mandating efiling in civil cases beginning in january 2014 mandatory efiling will be phased in over a two and a half year period beginning with the largest counties in january 2014 we will be paid on a fixed fee basis but had very limited revenues in 2013 from efiletexasgov however during 2013 we incurred expenses of approximately 33 million in connection with implementing the system in courts across the state excluding the limited revenues and cost incurred in connection with implementing efiletexasgov in 2013 our software services maintenance and subscription services gross margin would have been approximately 428 our implementation and support staff has increased by 202 employees since 2012 most of these additions occurred midto late 2013 

appraisal services  appraisal services revenues are approximately 5 of total revenues the appraisal services gross margin declined slightly compared to 2012 a high proportion of the costs of appraisal services revenue are variable as we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects whose term of employment generally ends with the projects’ completion 

our blended gross margin for 2013 increased 02 from 2012 the increase was due to higher royalty revenue and also benefited from a product mix that included slightly higher proprietary software revenues than third party software costs incurred related to our implementation of efiletexasgov with minimal related revenues as well as increased hiring of implementation and support staff in order to expand our capacity to implement our contract backlog offset some of the positive impact of higher royalty and proprietary software revenue

appraisal services  appraisal services revenues are approximately 6 of total revenues the appraisal services gross margin declined compared to 2011 the appraisal services gross margin in 2011 was also favorably impacted by operational efficiencies associated with a large revaluation contract which began in mid2010 and was substantially complete by mid2011 

our blended gross margin for 2012 increased 03 from 2011 mainly due to leverage in the utilization of our support maintenance and subscriptionbased services staff and economies of scale and slightly higher rates on certain services the gross margin also benefited from lower third party software costs and higher royalties

financial condition and liquidity 

as of december 31 2013 we had cash and cash equivalents of 789 million and investments availableforsale of 13 million compared to cash and cash equivalents of 64 million and investments availableforsale of 20 million at december 31 2012 as of december 31 2013 we had no outstanding borrowings and an outstanding letter of credit totaling 20 million some of our customers require a letter of credit in connection with our contracts the notional amount of performance guarantees outstanding secured by letter of credit as of december 31 2013 was estimated to be approximately 290 million we do not believe this letter of credit will be required to be drawn upon we believe that cash from operating activities cash on hand and access to the credit markets provides us with sufficient flexibility to meet our longterm financial needs 

the following table sets forth a summary of cash flows for the years ended december 31 

 

 net cash provided by operating activities continues to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures other potential capital resources include cash on hand public and private issuances of debt or equity securities and bank borrowings it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets in the future may be limited by economic conditions or other factors we currently believe that cash provided by operating activities cash on hand and access to the credit markets are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures income tax obligations and share repurchases for at least the next twelve months 

in 2013 operating activities provided net cash of 661 million primarily generated from net income of 391 million noncash depreciation and amortization charges of 138 million and noncash sharebased compensation expense of 117 million cash from operations also benefited from timing of payments on wages and bonuses in addition deferred revenue balances were higher than 2012 due to an increase in annual software maintenance billings as a result of growth in our installed customer base and growth in subscriptionbased arrangements these increases in liabilities were offset somewhat by higher accounts receivable balances from annual software maintenance billings progress billings associated with large contracts and prepaid commissions on large contracts  

in general changes in the balance of deferred revenue are cyclical and primarily driven by the timing of our maintenance renewal billings our renewal dates occur throughout the year but our heaviest renewal cycles occur in the second and fourth quarters 

at december 31 2013 our days sales outstanding “dsos” were 87 days compared to dsos of 95 days at december 31 2012 dsos are calculated based on accounts receivable excluding longterm receivables but including unbilled receivables divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by 360 days accounts receivable at december 31 2012 included several large billings for retentions associated with appraisal contracts 

investing activities used cash of 257 million in 2013 compared to 347 million in 2012 investing activities in 2013 include 203 million paid in connection with the construction of an office building in plano texas compared to 23 million in 2012 in 2012 we completed the acquisitions of akanda innovations inc unifund llc computer software associates inc and energov solutions llc the combined cash purchase prices paid in 2012 net of cash acquired was approximately 257 million in may 2012 we purchased land and a building in moraine ohio to support our appraisal and tax operations for a purchase price of 26 million which was comprised of 17 million in cash and land and a building valued at 900000 these expenditures were funded from cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit line

we have a 1500 million credit agreement the “credit facility” and a related pledge and security agreement with a group of seven financial institutions with bank of america na as administrative agent the credit facility provides for a revolving credit line of 1500 million which may be increased up to 2000 million subject to our obtaining commitments for such increase with a 250 million sublimit for letters of credit the credit facility matures on august 11 2014 borrowings under the credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes including working capital requirements acquisitions and share repurchases 

borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a rate of either 1 the bank of america’s prime rate plus a margin of 150 to 275 or 2 the 30 60 90 or 180day libor rate plus a margin of 250 to 375 with the margin determined by our consolidated leverage ratio the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets excluding real property the credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial conditions and prohibits us from making certain investments advances cash dividends or loans and limits incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens as of december 31 2013 we were in compliance with those covenants 

as of december 31 2013 we had no outstanding borrowings and unused available borrowing capacity of 1480 million under the credit facility in addition as of december 31 2013 our bank had issued an outstanding letter of credit totaling 20 million this letter of credit reduces our available borrowing capacity and expires in 2014 

we paid income taxes net of refunds received of 93 million in 2013 131 million in 2012 and 134 million in 2011 we experienced significant stock option exercise activity in 2013 that generated 282 million excess tax benefits excess tax benefits reduce tax payments but do not significantly reduce the effective tax rate and can result in limitations on other deductions the majority of this excess tax benefit was generated in the last half of 2013 and as a result we anticipate a tax refund in 2014 for approximately 97 million in 2012 and 2011 excess tax benefits were 88 million and 36 million respectively 

excluding acquisitions we anticipate that 2014 capital spending will be between 120 million and 130 million we expect the majority of this capital spending will consist of computer equipment and software for infrastructure replacements and expansion we currently do not expect to capitalize significant amounts related to software development in 2014 but the actual amount and timing of those costs and whether they are capitalized or expensed may result in additional capitalized software development capital spending is expected to be funded from existing cash balances and cash flows from operations 

 

from time to time we engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates in order to pursue such opportunities which could require significant commitments of capital we may be required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive securities in the future no assurance can be given as to our future acquisition opportunities and how such opportunities will be financed 

we lease office facilities as well as transportation computer and other equipment used in our operations under noncancelable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through 2021 most leases contain renewal options and some contain purchase options 

summarized in the table below are our obligations to make future payments under our longterm revolving credit agreement and lease obligations at december 31 2013 in thousands

traditionally local government bodies and agencies performed statemandated duties including property assessment record keeping road maintenance law enforcement administration of election and judicial functions and the provision of welfare assistance today a host of emerging and urgent issues are confronting local governments each of which demands a service response these areas include criminal justice and corrections administration and finance public safety health and human services and public works transfers of responsibility from the federal and state governments to county and municipal governments and agencies in these and other areas also place additional service and financial requirements on these local government units in addition constituents of local governments are increasingly demanding improved service and better access to information from public entities as a result local governments recognize the increasing value of information management systems and services to among other things improve revenue collection provide increased access to information and streamline delivery of services to their constituents local government bodies are now recognizing that “egovernment” is an additional responsibility for community development from integrated tax systems to integrated civil and criminal justice information systems many counties and cities have benefited significantly from the implementation of jurisdictionwide systems that allow different agencies or government offices to share data and provide a more comprehensive approach to information management many city and county governmental agencies also have unique individual information management requirements which must be tailored to the specific functions of each particular office 

many local governments also have difficulties attracting and retaining the staff necessary to support their it functions as a result they seek to establish longterm relationships with reliable providers of high quality it products and services such as tyler 

although local governments generally face budgetary constraints in their operations their primary revenue sources are usually property taxes and to a lesser extent utility billings and other fees which historically tend to be relatively stable in addition the acquisition of new technology typically enables local governments to operate more efficiently and often provides a measurable return on investment that justifies the purchase of software and related services 

  

gartner estimates that state and local government application and vertical specific software spending will decline slightly from 93 billion in 2013 to 89 billion in 2016 the professional services and support segments of the market where our business is primarily focused is expected to expand from 366 billion in 2013 to 411 billion in 2016 software sales in the primary and secondary education segments of the market is expected to expand from 28 billion in 2013 to 36 billion in 2016 while professional services and support are expected to grow from 21 billion in 2013 to 25 billion in 2016 

products and services 

we provide a comprehensive and flexible suite of products and services that addresses the information technology needs of cities counties schools and other local government entities we derive our revenues from five primary sources 

 

  

  

  

  

 we design develop and market a broad range of software solutions to serve missioncritical “backoffice” functions of local governments many of our software applications include internetaccessible solutions that allow for realtime public access to a variety of information or that allow the public to transact business with local governments via the internet our software solutions and services are generally grouped in three major areas 

 

  

  

 each of our core software systems consists of several fully integrated applications for customers who acquire the software for use inhouse we generally license our systems under standard perpetual license agreements that provide the customer with a fully paid nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software in some of the product areas such as financial management and education and property appraisal and tax we offer multiple solutions designed to meet the needs of different sized governments 

we also offer saas arrangements which utilize the tyler private cloud for customers who do not wish to maintain update and operate these systems or to make upfront capital expenditures to implement these advanced technologies for these customers we deliver our software using the saas model — the software and client data are hosted at our data centers or at thirdparty locations and customers typically sign multiyear contracts for these subscriptionbased services 

historically we have had a greater proportion of our annual revenues in the second half of our fiscal year due to governmental budget and spending cycles and the timing of system implementations for customers desiring to “go live” at the beginning of the calendar year

subscriptionbased services 

subscriptionbased revenue is primarily derived from our saas arrangements which utilize the tyler private cloud as well as our transaction based offerings such as efiling solutions 

we are able to provide the majority of our software products on our saas model the customers who choose this model typically do not wish to maintain update and operate these systems or make upfront capital expenditures to implement these advanced technologies the contract terms for these arrangements range from one to 10 years but are typically contracted for a period of three to six years the majority of our saas or hosting arrangements include additional professional services as well as maintenance and support services in certain arrangements the customer may also acquire a license to the software 

as part of our subscriptionbased services we provide efiling solutions that simplify the filing and management of court related documents for courts and law offices revenues for efilings are included in subscriptionbased revenues and are generally derived from transaction fees 

software services 

we provide a variety of professional it services to customers who utilize our software products virtually all of our customers contract with us for installation training and data conversion services in connection with their purchase of tyler’s software solutions the complete implementation process for a typical system includes planning design data conversion setup and testing at the culmination of the implementation process an installation team travels to the customer’s facility to ensure the smooth transfer of data to the new system installation fees are charged separately to customers on either a fixedfee or hourly charge basis depending on the contract 

both in connection with the installation of new systems and on an ongoing basis we provide extensive training services and programs related to our products and services training can be provided in our training centers onsite at customers’ locations or at meetings and conferences and can be customized to meet customers’ requirements the vast majority of our customers contract with us for training services both to improve their employees’ proficiency and productivity and to fully utilize the functionality of our systems training services are generally billed on an hourly or daily basis along with travel and other expenses

following the implementation of our software systems we provide ongoing software support services to assist our customers in operating the systems and to periodically update the software support is provided over the phone to customers through help desks staffed by our customer support representatives for more complicated issues our staff with the customers’ permission can log on to customers’ systems remotely we maintain our customers’ software largely through releases that contain improvements and incremental additions along with updates necessary because of legislative or regulatory changes 

virtually all of our software customers contract with us for maintenance and support which provides us with a significant source of recurring revenue we generally provide maintenance and support under annual contracts with a typical fee based on a percentage of the software product’s license fee these fees can be increased annually and may also increase as new license fees increase maintenance and support fees are generally paid in advance for the entire maintenance contract period most maintenance contracts automatically renew unless the customer or tyler gives notice of termination prior to expiration similar support is provided to our saas customers and is included in their subscription fees which are classified as subscriptionbased revenues 

appraisal services 

we are the nation’s largest provider of property appraisal outsourcing services for local government taxing authorities these services include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 local government taxing authorities normally reappraise properties from time to time to update values for tax assessment purposes and to maintain equity in the taxing process in some jurisdictions reassessment cycles are mandated by law in others they are discretionary while some taxing jurisdictions perform reappraisals inhouse many local governments outsource this function because of its cyclical nature and because of the specialized knowledge and expertise requirements associated with it our appraisal services business unit has been in this business since 1938 

in some instances we also sell property tax andor appraisal software products in connection with appraisal outsourcing projects while other customers may only engage us to provide appraisal services appraisal outsourcing services are somewhat seasonal in nature to the extent that winter weather conditions reduce the productivity of data collection activities in connection with those projects 

strategy 

our objective is to grow our revenue and earnings internally supplemented by focused strategic acquisitions the key components of our business strategy are to 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

sales marketing and customers 

we market our products and services through direct sales and marketing personnel located throughout the united states other inhouse sales staff focuses on addon sales professional services and support 

sales of new systems are typically generated from referrals from other government offices or departments within a county or municipality referrals from other local governments relationships established between sales representatives and county or local officials contacts at trade shows direct mailings and direct contact from prospects already familiar with us we are active in numerous national state county and local government associations and participate in annual meetings trade shows and educational events 

customers consist primarily of county and municipal agencies school districts and other local government offices in counties customers include the auditor treasurer tax assessorcollector county clerk district clerk county and district court judges probation officers sheriff and county appraiser at municipal government sites customers include directors from various departments including administration finance utilities public works code enforcement personnel purchasing taxation municipal court and police contracts for software products and services are generally implemented over periods of three months to one year with annually renewing maintenance and support update agreements thereafter although either the customer or we can terminate these agreements historically almost all support and maintenance agreements are automatically renewed annually contracts for appraisal outsourcing services are generally one to three years in duration during 2012 approximately 47 of our revenue was attributable to ongoing support and maintenance agreements 

competition 

we compete with numerous local regional and national firms that provide or offer some or many of the same solutions and services that we provide many of these competitors are smaller companies that may be able to offer less expensive solutions than ours many of these firms operate within a specific geographic area andor in a narrow product or service niche we also compete with national firms some of which have greater financial and technical resources than we do including oracle corporation lawson software inc sap ag affiliated computer services inc a unit of xerox corporation sungard data systems inc new world systems american cadastre llc amcad constellation software inc and manatron inc a unit of thomson reuters in addition we sometimes compete with consulting and systems integration firms such as deloitte llp which develop custom systems primarily for larger governments we also occasionally compete with central internal information service departments of local governments which require us to persuade the enduser department to discontinue service by its own personnel and outsource the service to us we compete on a variety of factors including price service name recognition reputation technological capabilities and the ability to modify existing products and services to accommodate the individual requirements of the customer our ability to offer an integrated system of applications for several offices or departments is often a competitive strength local governmental units often are required to seek competitive proposals through a request for proposal process 

suppliers 

substantially all of the computers peripherals printers scanners operating system software office automation software and other equipment necessary for the implementation and provision of our software systems and services are presently available from several thirdparty sources hardware is purchased on original equipment manufacturer or distributor terms at discounts from retail we have not experienced any significant supply problems 

backlog 

at december 31 2012 our estimated revenue backlog was approximately 3806 million compared to 3398 million at december 31 2011 the backlog represents signed contracts under which the revenue has not been recognized as of yearend approximately 2674 million or 70 of the backlog is expected to be recognized during 2013 

  

intellectual property proprietary rights and licenses 

we regard certain features of our internal operations software and documentation as confidential and proprietary and rely on a combination of contractual restrictions trade secret laws and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property we generally do not rely on patents we believe that due to the rapid rate of technological change in the computer software industry trade secrets and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as knowledge ability and experience of our employees frequent product enhancements and timeliness and quality of support services we typically license our software products under nonexclusive license agreements which are generally nontransferable and have a perpetual term 

employees 

at december 31 2012 we had 2388 employees appraisal outsourcing projects are cyclical in nature and can be widely dispersed geographically we often hire temporary employees to assist in these projects whose term of employment generally ends with the project’s completion none of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to collective bargaining agreements we consider our relations with our employees to be positive

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk investors evaluating our company should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this annual report any of the following factors could materially harm our business operating results and financial condition additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business operating results and financial condition this section should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report we may make forwardlooking statements from time to time both written and oral we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forwardlooking statements our actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forwardlooking statements due to a number of factors including those set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report 

risks associated with selling products and services into the public sector marketplace 

a prolonged economic slowdown could harm our operations 

a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce demand for our software products and services local and state governments may face financial pressures that could in turn affect our growth rate in 2013 there is no assurance that local and state spending levels will be unaffected by declining or stagnant general economic conditions and if budget shortfalls occur they may negatively impact local and state information technology spending and could have a material adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition 

  

  

selling products and services into the public sector poses unique challenges 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of software and services to state county and city governments other municipal agencies and other public entities we expect that sales to public sector customers will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues in the future we face many risks and challenges associated with contracting with governmental entities including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 each of these risks is outside our control if we fail to adequately adapt to these risks and uncertainties our financial performance could be adversely affected 

a decline in the demand for information technology spending may result in a decrease in our revenues or lower our growth rate 

a decline in the demand for information technology among our current and prospective customers may result in decreased revenues or a lower growth rate for us because our sales depend in part on our customers’ level of funding for new or additional information technology systems and services moreover demand for our solutions may be reduced by a decline in overall demand for computer software and services accordingly we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase or maintain our revenues 

the open bidding process for governmental contracts creates uncertainty in predicting future contract awards 

many governmental agencies purchase products and services through an open bidding process generally a governmental entity will publish an established list of requirements requesting potential vendors to propose solutions for the established requirements to respond successfully to these requests for proposals we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract the time required to establish operations for the proposed client and the likely terms of any other third party proposals submitted we cannot guarantee that we will win any bids in the future through the request for proposal process or that any winning bids will ultimately result in contracts on favorable terms our failure to secure contracts through the open bidding process or to secure such contracts on favorable terms may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we face significant competition from other vendors and potential new entrants into our markets 

we believe we are a leading provider of integrated solutions for the public sector however we face competition from a variety of software vendors that offer products and services similar to those offered by us as well as from companies offering to develop custom software we compete on the basis of a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe the market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors that vary in size primary computer platforms and overall product scope our competitors include consulting firms publicly held companies that focus on selected segments of the public sector market and a significant number of smaller privately held companies certain competitors have greater technical marketing and financial resources than we do we cannot assure you that such competitors will not develop products or offer services that are superior to our products or services or that achieve greater market acceptance 

we also compete with internal centralized information service departments of governmental entities which require us to persuade the enduser to stop the internal service and outsource to us in addition our customers may elect in the future to provide information management services internally through new or existing departments which could reduce the market for our services 

we could face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the public sector software application market and new products and technologies are introduced increased competition could result in pricing pressure fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share in addition current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with thirdparties thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share further competitive pressures could require us to reduce the price of our software licenses and related services we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition 

fixed price contracts may affect our profits 

some of our present contracts are on a fixedpriced basis which can lead to various risks including 

 

  

  

 if we do not adequately assess these and other risks we may be subject to cost overruns and penalties which may harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

changes in the insurance markets may affect our ability to win some contract awards and may lead to increased expenses 

some of our customers primarily those for our property appraisal services require that we secure performance bonds before they will select us as their vendor in addition we are generally required to provide letters of credit as security for the issuance of a performance bond our current credit facility contains a 250 million sublimit for letters of credit we cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure such performance bonds in the future on terms that are favorable to us if at all our inability to obtain performance bonds on favorable terms or at all could impact our future ability to win some contract awards particularly large property appraisal services contracts which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

volatility in the stock markets increasing shareholder litigation the adoption of expansive legislation that redefines corporate controls in particular legislation adopted to prevent future corporate and accounting scandals as well as other factors have at times led to volatility in premiums for directors’ and officers’ liability insurance volatility of the insurance market may result in future increases in our general and administrative expenses which may adversely affect future operating results 

risks associated with our periodic results and stock price 

as with other software vendors we may be required to delay revenue recognition into future periods which could adversely impact our operating results 

we have in the past had to and in the future may have to defer revenue recognition for license fees due to several factors including whether 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 because of the factors listed above and other specific requirements under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states for software revenue recognition we must have very precise terms in our license agreements in order to recognize revenue when we initially deliver and install software or perform services negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions can extend the sales cycle and sometimes we do not obtain terms and conditions that permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery or even as work on the project is completed 

we may experience fluctuations in quarterly revenue that could adversely impact our stock price and our operating results 

our actual revenues in a quarter could fall below expectations which could lead to a decline in our stock price our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter revenues from license fees in any quarter depend substantially upon our contracting activity and our ability to recognize revenues in that quarter in accordance with our revenue recognition policies our quarterly revenue may fluctuate and may be difficult to forecast for a variety of reasons including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

 fluctuation in our quarterly revenues may adversely affect our operating results in each fiscal quarter our expense levels operating costs and hiring plans are based to some extent on projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed if our actual revenues fall below expectations we could experience a reduction in operating results 

increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins and adversely affect our operating results 

we realize lower margins on software and appraisal service revenues than on license revenue the majority of our contracts include both software licenses and professional services therefore an increase in the percentage of software service and appraisal service revenue compared to license revenue could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and could adversely affect operating results 

our stock price may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and may be significantly affected by many different factors some examples of factors that can have a significant impact on our stock price include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for the common stock of technology companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company we cannot assure you that similar litigation will not occur in the future with respect to us such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition 

financial outlook 

from time to time in press releases and otherwise we may publish forecasts or other forwardlooking statements regarding our results including estimated revenues or net earnings any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties and as a matter of course any number of them may prove to be incorrect further the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors including those described in this discussion many of which are beyond our control as a result we cannot be certain that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse current and potential stockholders are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions but instead are encouraged to utilize our entire publicly available mix of historical and forwardlooking information as well as other available information regarding us our products and services and the software industry when evaluating our prospective results of operations 

  

risks associated with our software products 

our products are complex and we run the risk of errors or defects with new product introductions or enhancements 

software products as complex as those developed by us may contain errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released although we have not experienced material adverse effects resulting from any such defects or errors to date we cannot assure you that material defects and errors will not be found after commencement of product shipments any such defects could result in loss of revenues or delay market acceptance 

our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims it is possible however that we may not always be able to negotiate such provisions in our contracts with customers or that the limitation of liability provisions contained in our license agreements may not be effective as a result of existing or future federal state or local laws ordinances or judicial decisions although we maintain errors and omissions and general liability insurance and we try to structure our contracts to include limitations on liability we cannot assure you that a successful claim could not be made or would not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we must respond to rapid technological changes to be competitive 

the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards in computer hardware and software technology changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result our future success will depend in part upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products and develop and introduce in a timely manner or acquire new products that keep pace with technological developments satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and costeffective manner further we cannot assure you that the products capabilities or technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive if we are unable to develop or acquire on a timely and costeffective basis new software products or enhancements to existing products or if such new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance our business operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights 

many of our product and service offerings incorporate proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of contracts copyrights and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology we cannot be certain that we have taken all appropriate steps to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property in addition there has been significant litigation in the united states in recent years involving intellectual property rights we are not currently involved in any material intellectual property litigation we may however be a party to intellectual property litigation in the future to protect our proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights further we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us in the future with respect to current or future products any claims or litigation with or without merit could be timeconsuming and result in costly litigation and diversion of management’s attention further any claims and litigation could cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements such royalty or licensing arrangements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all thus litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations regardless of the final outcome of such litigation 

we generally grant our customers fully paid perpetual licenses to use our software applications and customers may elect to terminate our maintenance contracts and manage operations internally 

it is possible that governments and their successors and affiliates may elect to not renew maintenance contracts for our software trying instead to maintain and operate the software themselves using their right of use license rights to the software programs and other applications we have developed for them in their operations excluding software applications that we provide on a softwareasaservice basis this could adversely affect our revenues and profits additionally they may inadvertently allow our intellectual property or other information to fall into the hands of third parties including our competitors 

  

we cannot fully protect client information from security breaches 

as a provider of hosted services we receive maintain process and transmit confidential information on behalf of our clients and other authorized users there is no guarantee that the systems and procedures that we maintain to protect against unauthorized access to such information are adequate to protect against loss destruction computer breakins theft or other improper activity that could jeopardize the security of such information for which we are responsible any such lapse in security could expose us to litigation loss of customers harm our business reputation and otherwise cause a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

hosting services for some of our products are dependent upon the uninterrupted operation of data centers 

a material portion of our business is provided through hosting services of some of our software products these hosting services depend on the uninterrupted operation of data centers and the ability to protect computer equipment and information stored in these data centers against damage that may be caused by natural disaster fire power loss telecommunications or internet failure unauthorized intrusion computer viruses and other similar damaging events if any of our data centers were to become inoperable for an extended period we might be unable to provide our customers with contracted services although we take what we believe to be reasonable precautions against such occurrences we can give no assurance that damaging events such as these will not result in a prolonged interruption of our services which could result in customer dissatisfaction loss of revenue and damage to our business 

material portions of our business require the internet infrastructure to be further developed or adequately maintained 

the internet has experienced and is expected to continue to experience significant growth in the number of users and amount of traffic if the web continues to experience increased numbers of users frequency of use or increased bandwidth requirements the internet infrastructure may not be able to support these increased demands or perform reliably the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure and could face such outages and delays in the future these outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage and traffic on our government portals such outages and delays would also hinder our customers’ ability to complete online transactions in addition the internet could lose its viability due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased levels of activity or due to increased governmental regulation if the internet infrastructure is not adequately further developed or maintained use of our government portals and our citizentogovernment and businesstogovernment services may be reduced 

part of our future success depends on the use of the internet as a means to access public information and perform transactions electronically including for example electronic filing of court documents this in part requires the further development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure if this infrastructure fails to be further developed or be adequately maintained our business would be harmed because users may not be able to access our government portals among other things this further development and maintenance will require a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed data capacity security and timely development of complementary products for providing reliable internet access and services 

risks associated with our growth strategy and other general corporate risks 

we may experience difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy 

a significant portion of our growth has resulted from strategic acquisitions in new product and geographic markets although our focus is on internal growth we will continue to identify and pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances with suitable candidates our future success will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate future acquisitions and other strategic alliances into our operations acquisitions may involve a number of special risks including diversion of management’s attention failure to retain key acquired personnel unanticipated events or circumstances legal liabilities and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we conduct due diligence reviews of potential acquisition candidates we may not identify all material liabilities or risks related to acquisition candidates there can be no assurance that any such strategic acquisitions or alliances will be accomplished on favorable terms or will result in profitable operations 

our failure to properly manage growth could adversely affect our business 

we have expanded our operations since 1998 when we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector we intend to continue expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities this growth places a significant demand on management and operational resources in order to manage growth effectively we must implement and improve our operational systems procedures and controls on a timely basis we must also identify hire train and manage key managerial and technical personnel if we fail to implement these systems or employ and retain such qualified personnel our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

  

we may be unable to hire integrate and retain qualified personnel 

our continued success will depend upon the availability and performance of our key management sales marketing customer support and product development personnel the loss of key management or technical personnel could adversely affect us we believe that our continued success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract integrate and retain such personnel we have at times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel competition for qualified software development sales and other personnel is intense and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 new securities and exchange commission regulations and new york stock exchange rules are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours the costs required to comply with such evolving laws are difficult to predict to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards this investment may result in an unforeseen increase in general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenuegenerating activities which may harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

historically we have not paid dividends on our common stock 

we have not declared or paid a cash dividend since we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector in 1998 additionally our bank credit agreement contains restrictions on the payment of cash dividends we intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law could deter takeover attempts 

our board of directors may issue up to 1000000 shares of preferred stock and may determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting and conversion rights of these shares of preferred stock these determinations may be made without any further vote or action by our stockholders the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock in addition some provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and of the delaware general corporation law could also delay prevent or make more difficult a merger tender offer or proxy contest involving us

outlook 

we expect the trend of gradual improvements in the marketplace to continue in 2013 we plan to make significant investments in our business that we believe will enhance our market leadership and improve longterm revenue and margin growth these investments include expenses associated with new efiling contracts as well as accelerated hiring to ensure that we are wellpositioned to deliver our current backlog and anticipated new business 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements the reported amounts of revenues cost of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosure of contingencies the notes to the financial statements included as part of this annual report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the application of the percentageofcompletion and proportional performance methods of revenue recognition the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of intangible assets determination of sharebased compensation expense and valuation allowance for receivables we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards codification “asc” 605 revenue recognition and asc 985605 software revenue recognition our revenues are derived from sales of software licenses subscriptionbased services appraisal services maintenance and support and services that typically range from installation training and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs for multiple element software arrangements which do not entail the performance of services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software we generally record revenue when the delivered products or performed services result in a legally enforceable and nonrefundable claim we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized because most of our customers are governmental entities we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments in a limited number of cases we encounter a customer who is dissatisfied with some aspect of the software product or our service and we may offer a “concession” to such customer in those limited situations where we grant a concession we rarely reduce the contract arrangement fee but alternatively may perform additional services such as additional training or creating additional custom reports these amounts have historically been nominal in connection with our customer contracts and the adequacy of related allowances and measures of progress towards contract completion our project managers are charged with the responsibility to continually review the status of each customer on a specific contract basis also we review on at least a quarterly basis significant past due accounts receivable and the adequacy of related reserves events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments may require revision include but are not limited to deterioration of a customer’s financial condition failure to manage our customer’s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products 

we use contract accounting primarily the percentageofcompletion method as discussed in asc 60535 construction – type and certain production – type contracts for those software arrangements that involve significant production modification or customization of the software or where our software services are otherwise considered essential to the functionality of the software we measure progresstocompletion primarily using labor hours incurred or value added in addition we recognize revenue using the proportional performance method of revenue recognition for our property appraisal projects some of which can range up to five years these methods rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue billings and collections and expected contract costs as well as measures of progress toward completion we believe reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs and progress applicable to various stages of a contract can be made at times we perform additional andor noncontractual services for little to no incremental fee to satisfy customer expectations if changes occur in delivery productivity or other factors used in developing our estimates of expected costs or revenues we revise our cost and revenue estimates and any revisions are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision first become known in connection with these and certain other contracts we may perform the work prior to when the services are billable andor payable pursuant to the contract the termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the value of products delivered and services performed in the event of an early termination 

  

for saas arrangements we evaluate whether the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and whether the customer can feasibly maintain the software on the customer’s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a third party to host the software if we determine that the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and can feasibly maintain the software on the customer’s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a third party to host the software we recognize the license professional services and hosting services revenues pursuant to asc 985605 software revenue recognition for saas arrangements that do not meet the criteria for recognition under asc 985605 we account for the elements under asc 60525 multiple element arrangements using all applicable facts and circumstances including whether i the element has standalone value ii there is a general right of return and iii the revenue is contingent on delivery of other elements we allocate the contract value to each element of the arrangement that qualifies for treatment as a separate element based on vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” and if vsoe is not available third party evidence and if third party evidence is unavailable estimated selling price for professional services associated with saas arrangements that we determine do not have standalone value to the customer or are contingent on delivery of other elements we recognize the services revenue ratably over the remaining contractual period once hosting has gone live and we may begin billing for the hosting services we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 

in connection with certain of our contracts we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet date many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period we review unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue in addition we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue which represents billings in excess of revenue earned the majority of this liability consists of maintenance billings for which payments are made in advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the maintenance period generally one year we also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit and the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product has not been met on a periodic basis we review by customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains appropriate 

intangible assets and goodwill  our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge the cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value with the excess allocated to goodwill accordingly we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets including software customer related intangibles trade name and goodwill these intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives we currently have no intangible assets with indefinite lives other than goodwill 

when testing goodwill for impairment quantitatively we first compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is performed to measure the amount of potential impairment in the second step we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized the fair values calculated in our impairment tests are determined using discounted cash flow models involving several assumptions the assumptions that are used are based upon what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain we evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by comparing the total of the fair value of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization 

in the first quarter of 2012 asu 201108 “testing goodwill for impairment” became effective asu 201108 allows entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit ie the first step of the goodwill impairment test if entities determine on the basis of qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount a quantitative calculation would not be needed 

  

our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed quantitatively during the second quarter of 2012 did not result in an impairment charge during 2012 we did not identify any triggering events which would require an update to our annual impairment review 

all intangible assets with definite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of other intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows the assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved such indicators may include among others a significant decline in expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition and reductions in growth rates in addition products capabilities or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or noncompetitive any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets 

sharebased compensation we have a stock option plan that provides for the grant of stock options to key employees directors and nonemployee consultants we estimate the fair value of sharebased awards on the date of grant using the blackscholes option valuation model sharebased compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures which will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from such estimates changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data we estimate stock price volatility at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock estimated option life is determined using the “simplified method” in accordance with asc 71810 stock compensation determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates 

  

analysis of results of operations and other 

the following discussion compares the historical results of operations on a basis consistent with gaap for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

 

   

2012 compared to 2011 

revenues 

software licenses 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software license revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

 excluding the impact of acquisitions total software license revenue declined by 6 compared to 2011 most of the decline was due to fewer addon sales to our existing customer base in addition software license growth was reduced somewhat because of a growing number of customers choosing our subscriptionbased options rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement subscriptionbased arrangements result in no software license revenues in the initial year as compared to traditional perpetual software license arrangements but generate higher overall subscriptionbased services revenue over the term of the contract we had 76 new customers that entered into subscriptionbased arrangements in 2012 compared to 47 new customers in 2011 we expect software license revenues in 2013 to be higher than 2012 but the mix of software license arrangements and subscriptionbased arrangements may reduce the degree of the increase 

subscriptions 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our subscription revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

 subscriptionbased services revenue primarily consists of revenues derived from our saas arrangements which utilize the tyler private cloud as part of our subscriptionbased services we also provide efilings that simplify the filing and management of court related documents for courts and law offices revenues for efilings are generally derived from transaction fees the contract term for saas arrangements range from one to 10 years but are typically for a period of three to six years 

excluding the impact of acquisitions subscriptionbased services revenue increased 40 compared to 2011 new saas customers as well as existing customers who converted to our saas model provided the majority of the subscriptionbased revenue increase in 2012 we added 76 new customers and 68 existing customers elected to convert to our saas model efiling services also contributed approximately 23 million of the subscription revenue increase as a result of new clients implementing efiling and several existing clients adopting or expanding mandatory efiling for court documents in the last half of 2011 and 2012 

  

software services  

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software services revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

 software services revenues primarily consists of professional services billed in connection with the installation of our software conversion of customer data training customer personnel and consulting new customers who purchase our proprietary software licenses generally also contract with us to provide for the related software services existing customers also periodically purchase additional training consulting and minor programming services excluding the impact of acquisitions software services increased 14 compared to 2011 the increase is due partly to contract arrangements that included more programming services as well as several statewide arrangements that in addition to services include more third party vendor services to build certain software interfaces 

maintenance  

the following table sets forth a comparison of our maintenance revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

 we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and certain third party software excluding the impact of acquisitions maintenance revenue grew 9 from 2011 this increase was due to growth in our installed customer base and maintenance rate increases on most of our product lines offset slightly by customers converting to our saas model 

appraisal services 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our appraisal service revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

 appraisal services revenue declined 3 in 2012 compared to 2011 the appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states the decline is mainly due to the completion of a large contract in pennsylvania offset slightly by the startup of smaller projects in 2012 including several in ohio we expect appraisal revenues for 2013 will increase slightly compared to 2012 

  

cost of revenues and gross margins 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

 the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the years ended december 31 

 

 software license and acquired software  costs of software license and acquired software are primarily comprised of third party software costs and amortization expense for software acquired through acquisitions in 2012 our software license gross margin percentage increased compared to 2011 because our product mix included less third party software which offset higher amortization expense associated with acquisitions 

software services maintenance and subscriptionbased services  cost of software services maintenance and subscriptionbased services primarily consists of personnel costs related to installation of our software conversion of customer data training customer personnel and support activities and various other services such as saas arrangements and efilings maintenance and various other services such as saas costs typically grow at a slower rate than related revenues due to leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale in 2012 the software services maintenance and subscriptions gross margin increased compared to the prior year partly because we improved our utilization of our support and maintenance staff and due to annual rate increases on certain services we are managing costs and staff levels to ensure they are in line with demand for professional services excluding 147 employees added with acquisitions our implementation and support staff has increased by 103 employees since 2011 most of these additions occurred mid to late 2012 we expect to increase development efforts in 2013 for geographic expansion efforts primarily in california and in our efiling solutions infrastructure in order to pursue more opportunities with both existing and new clients 

in late 2012 we signed a contract with the texas office of court administration for our odyssey file and serve efiling offering for texfile a unified statewide electronic filing system for courts subsequently the state of texas issued an order mandating efiling in civil cases beginning in january 2014 mandatory efiling will be phased in over a two and a half year period beginning with the largest counties in january 2014 we will be paid on a perfiling basis but expect very limited revenues from texfile efilings in 2013 however during 2013 we will invest significant amounts in the range of 30 million to prepare to implement the system with courts across the state with the recent order mandating efiling in texas we expect that this contract will provide a longterm recurring revenue stream of 150 million to 200 million when it becomes fully mandatory 

  

appraisal services  appraisal services revenues are approximately 6 of total revenues the appraisal services gross margin declined compared to 2011 a high proportion of the costs of appraisal services revenue are variable as we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects whose term of employment generally ends with the projects’ completion the appraisal services gross margin in 2011 was also favorably impacted by operational efficiencies associated with a large revaluation contract which began in mid2010 and was substantially complete by mid2011 

our blended gross margin for 2012 increased 03 from 2011 mainly due to leverage in the utilization of our support maintenance and subscriptionbased services staff and economies of scale and slightly higher rates on certain services the gross margin also benefited from lower third party software costs 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses consist primarily of salaries employee benefits travel sharebased compensation expense commissions and related overhead costs for administrative and sales and marketing employees as well as professional fees trade show activities advertising costs and other marketing related costs the following table sets forth a comparison of our sga expenses for the following years ended december 31 

 

 excluding the impact of acquisitions sga increased approximately 11 compared to 2011 sga as a percentage of revenues was 239 in 2012 compared to 245 in 2011 sga expenses increased due to higher commission expense in connection with increased sales increased headcount in sales and related expenses to support geographic expansion and increased incentive compensation costs due to improved results and higher stock compensation expense because our company stock price has increased substantially over the last few years 

research and development expense 

research and development expense consists primarily of salaries employee benefits and related overhead costs associated with product development the following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the years ended december 31 

 

 research and development expense consist mainly of costs associated with development of new products and new software platforms from which we do not currently generate revenue these include the next version of microsoft dynamics ax project as well as other new product development efforts in 2007 we entered into a software development and license agreement which provides for a strategic alliance with microsoft corporation “microsoft” to jointly develop core public sector functionality for microsoft dynamics ax to address the accounting needs of public sector organizations worldwide this agreement and subsequent amendments granted microsoft intellectual property rights in the software code provided and developed by tyler into microsoft dynamics ax products to be marketed and sold outside of the public sector in exchange for reimbursement payments to partially offset the research and development costs and royalties on direct and indirect publicsector sales worldwide of the solutions codeveloped under this arrangement in addition tyler has agreed to commit certain resources to the development of the next version of dynamics ax and will receive software and maintenance royalties on direct and indirect publicsector sales worldwide of the solutions codeveloped under this arrangement 

our research and development expense increased 37 million in 2012 compared to 2011 the increase is mainly due to lower reimbursements from microsoft in 2012 in 2012 we had 10 million in research and development expense offsets compared to 35 million in 2011 which were the amounts earned under the terms of our agreement with microsoft under our amended agreement with microsoft the project included offsets to research and development expense varying in amount from quarter to quarter from 2009 through 2012 for a total of approximately 62 million as of september 30 2012 we received the final 10 million under the agreement 

  

amortization of customer and trade name intangibles 

acquisition intangibles are comprised of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that is allocated to acquired software and customer and trade name intangibles the remaining excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues while amortization expense of customer and trade name intangibles is recorded as other operating expense the estimated useful lives of both customer and trade name intangibles are five to 25 years the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the years ended december 31 

 

 in 2012 we completed several acquisitions that increased amortizable customer and trade name intangibles by approximately 111 million this amount is being amortized over a weighted average period of 118 years 

estimated annual amortization expense relating to customer and trade name acquisition intangibles excluding acquired software for which the amortization expense is recorded as cost of revenues for the next five years is as follows in thousands 

 

 other 

the following table sets forth a comparison of other expense net for the years ended december 31 

 

 other expense is primarily comprised of interest expense nonusage and other fees associated with our revolving line of credit agreement interest expense was higher in 2012 than 2011 due to higher debt levels associated with several acquisitions completed since october 2011 and stock repurchases in the last half of 2011 the effective interest rate in 2012 was 34 compared to 33 in 2011 

income tax provision 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the years ended december 31 

 

   

the effective income tax rates for both years were different from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of 35 due to state income taxes nondeductible sharebased compensation expense the qualified manufacturing activities deduction disqualifying incentive stock option “isos” dispositions and nondeductible meals and entertainment costs the effective income tax rate in 2011 was also reduced by a research and development tax credit the qualified manufacturing activities deduction declined in 2012 contributing to a higher effective tax rate 

approximately 35 of our stock option expense is related to isos as such a tax benefit is not recorded at the time the compensation cost related to the options is recorded for book purposes due to the fact that an iso does not ordinarily result in a tax benefit unless there is a disqualifying disposition nonqualified stock options result in the creation of a deferred tax asset which is a temporary difference until the time that the option is exercised due to the treatment of isos for tax purposes our effective tax rate from year to year is subject to variability

 in october 2011 we acquired windsor which provides a suite of financial and human capital management software solutions to the k12 education market and is included in our ess segment excluding the impact of this acquisition total software license revenue declined by 8 compared to 2010 the decrease in software license revenues is mainly attributable to longer sales cycles and postponements of customer purchasing decisions mainly due to budgetary constraints related to economic conditions in addition a portion of the decline was due to a growing number of customers choosing our subscriptionbased options rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement 

subscriptions 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our subscription revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

 new customers for saas arrangements as well as existing customers who converted to our saas model provided the majority of the subscription revenue increase in 2011 we added 47 new customers and 40 existing customers elected to convert to our saas model efiling services also contributed approximately 500000 of the subscription revenue increase as a result of several counties and one state adopting or expanding mandatory efiling for court documents in the last half of 2011 

  

software services  

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software service revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

 excluding the impact of the windsor acquisition software services increased 1 in 2011 software services revenue included more third party vendor services to build certain software interfaces associated with a statewide contract and reflected slightly higher billing rates 

maintenance  

the following table sets forth a comparison of our maintenance revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

 excluding the impact of the windsor acquisition maintenance revenue grew 7 from 2010 this increase was due to growth in our installed customer base and slightly higher maintenance rates on most of our product lines our annual maintenance revenue growth rate has been reduced somewhat by the effect of existing installed customers converting to our saas model which results in a loss of maintenance revenue offset by a larger increase in subscription revenue 

appraisal services  

the following table sets forth a comparison of our appraisal service revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

 appraisal services revenue increased 13 in 2011 compared to 2010 the appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states we began work on several new large revaluation contracts in late 2009 and mid2010 which provided the majority of the increase in appraisal services revenues 

  

cost of revenues and gross margin 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

 the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the years ended december 31 

 

 software license and acquired software  cost of software license and acquired software in 2011 was comprised of third party software license with the remaining balance primarily related to amortization expense related to acquired software in 2010 cost of software license and acquired software also included amortization expense associated with capitalized software development in early 2011 most of our capitalized software development costs became fully amortized we did not capitalize any internal software development costs in 2011 or 2010 cost of software license and acquired software also declined due to several acquired software solutions that became fully amortized in early 2011 

in 2011 our software license gross margin percentage increased compared to the prior year period because several acquired software solutions and substantially all of our capitalized software development became fully amortized by 2011 

software services maintenance and subscriptionbased services  in 2011 the software services maintenance and subscriptions gross margin increased compared to the prior year partly because we improved our utilization of our support and maintenance staff and due to annual rate increases on certain services 

appraisal services  our appraisal services gross margin was flat compared to 2010 a high proportion of the costs of appraisal services revenue are variable as we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects whose term of employment generally ends with the projects’ completion 

our blended gross margin for 2011 increased 14 from 2010 mainly due to leverage in the utilization of our support maintenance and subscriptionbased services staff and economies of scale and slightly higher rates on certain services the gross margin also benefited from lower acquired software amortization costs 

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our sga expenses for the years ended december 31 

 

 sga as a percentage of revenues was 245 in 2011 compared to 241 in 2010 sga expenses in 2011 included costs associated with consolidating office space in our new yarmouth maine facility and other facilities related costs

 research and development expense consist mainly of costs associated with development of new products and new software platforms from which we do not currently generate revenue these include costs associated with the microsoft dynamics ax project as well as other new product development efforts in 2011 and 2010 we offset our research and development expense by 35 million and 51 million respectively which were the amounts earned under the terms of our agreement with microsoft 

amortization of customer and trade name intangibles 

the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the years ended december 31 

 

 in october 2011 we completed an acquisition that increased amortizable customer and trade name intangibles by approximately 56 million this amount is being amortized over 10 years 

other 

the following table sets forth a comparison of other expense net for the years ended december 31 

 

 interest expense was higher in 2011 than 2010 due to higher debt levels associated with our stock repurchases and the acquisition of windsor in october 2011 the effective interest rate in 2011 was 33 compared to 34 in 2010 

  

income tax provision 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the years ended december 31 

 

 the effective income tax rates for both years were different from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of 35 due to state income taxes nondeductible sharebased compensation expense the qualified manufacturing activities deduction the research and development tax credit and nondeductible meals and entertainment costs 

financial condition and liquidity 

as of december 31 2012 we had cash and cash equivalents of 64 million and investments availableforsale of 20 million compared to cash and cash equivalents of 13 million and investments availableforsale of 20 million at december 31 2011 as of december 31 2012 we had 180 million in outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit totaling 59 million some of our customers primarily those for our property appraisal services require that we secure performance bonds in connection with our contracts the maximum potential amount of an outstanding performance bond would be the remaining cost of work to be performed under our contracts the notional amount of performance guarantees outstanding as of december 31 2012 was estimated to be 351 million we provide letters of credit as security for the issuance of performance bonds we do not believe these letters of credit will be required to be drawn upon these letters of credit expire in 2013 we believe our 1500 million revolving line of credit provides us with sufficient flexibility to meet our longterm financial needs 

the following table sets forth a summary of cash flows for the years ended december 31 

 

 net cash provided by operating activities continues to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures other potential capital resources include cash on hand public and private issuances of debt or equity securities and bank borrowings it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets in the future may be limited by economic conditions or other factors we currently believe that cash provided by operating activities cash on hand and available credit are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures income tax obligations and share repurchases for at least the next twelve months 

in 2012 operating activities provided net cash of 587 million primarily generated from net income of 330 million noncash depreciation and amortization charges of 127 million and noncash sharebased compensation expense of 74 million working capital excluding cash declined 136 million mainly due to higher deferred revenue balances than 2011 due to an increase in annual software maintenance billings as a result of growth in our installed customer base in addition our growth in subscriptionbased arrangements has also contributed to larger deferred revenue balances the increase in deferred revenues was offset somewhat by higher accounts receivable balances from annual software maintenance billings 

in general changes in the balance of deferred revenue are cyclical and primarily driven by the timing of our maintenance renewal billings our renewal dates occur throughout the year but our heaviest renewal cycles occur in the second and fourth quarters 

  

at december 31 2012 our days sales outstanding “dsos” were 95 days compared to dsos of 99 days at december 31 2011 dsos are calculated based on accounts receivable excluding longterm receivables but including unbilled receivables divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by 360 days 

investments availableforsale consist of two auction rate municipal securities “ars” which are collateralized debt obligations supported by municipal agencies and do not include mortgagebacked securities these ars are debt instruments with stated maturities of 19 to 29 years for which the interest rate is designed to be reset through dutch auctions approximately every 30 days however due to events in the credit markets auctions for these securities have not occurred since february 2008 both of our ars have had very small partial redemptions at par in the period from july 2009 through july 2012 as of december 31 2012 we have continued to earn and collect interest on both of our ars because quoted prices in active markets are no longer available we determined the estimated fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted trinomial model the model considers the probability of three potential occurrences for each auction event through the maturity date of each ars the three potential outcomes for each auction are i successful auctionearly redemption ii failed auction and iii issuer default inputs in determining the probabilities of the potential outcomes include but are not limited to the securities’ collateral credit rating insurance issuer’s financial standing contractual restrictions on disposition and the liquidity in the market the fair value of each ars is determined by summing the present value of the probabilityweighted future principal and interest payments determined by the model since there can be no assurances that auctions for these securities will be successful in the near future we have classified our ars as noncurrent investments 

in connection with this estimate of fair value we have recorded an aftertax temporary unrealized gain on our noncurrent ars of 87000 net of related tax effects of 47000 in 2012 which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our balance sheet 

we consider the impairment in our ars as temporary because we do not have the intent to sell nor is it morelikelythannot that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their cost basis we believe that this temporary decline in fair value is due entirely to liquidity issues because the underlying assets of these securities are supported by municipal agencies and do not include mortgagebacked securities have redemption features which call for redemption at 100 of par value and have a current credit rating of a or aa the ratings on the ars take into account credit support through insurance policies guaranteeing each of the bonds’ payment of principal and accrued interest if it becomes necessary in addition both ars have had very small partial redemptions at par in the period july 2009 through july 2012 based on our cash and cash equivalents balance expected operating cash flows and a 1500 million revolving credit line we do not believe a lack of liquidity associated with our ars will adversely affect our ability to conduct business and believe we have the ability to hold the securities throughout the currently estimated recovery period we will continue to evaluate any changes in the fair value of our ars and in the future depending upon existing market conditions we may be required to record an otherthantemporary decline in market value 

investing activities used cash of 347 million in 2012 compared to 288 million in 2011 in 2012 we completed the acquisitions of akanda unifund csa and energov the combined cash purchase prices paid in 2012 net of cash acquired was approximately 257 million in may 2012 we purchased land and a building in moraine ohio to support our appraisal and tax operations for a purchase price of 26 million which was comprised of 17 million in cash and land and a building valued at 900000 we also paid 23 million in 2012 in connection with the construction of an office building in plano texas these expenditures were funded from cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit line 

in 2011 we completed the acquisition of windsor the purchase price net of cash acquired was approximately 164 million in march 2011 we paid 66 million for approximately 27 acres of land and a building in plano texas 

in january 2010 we completed the acquisition of the assets of wiznet inc for 95 million in cash also in connection with plans to consolidate workforces and support planned longterm growth we paid 13 million in 2010 in connection with the construction of an office building in lubbock texas the impact of these investing activities in 2010 was offset somewhat by the release of 60 million of restricted cash in august 2010 we elected to replace our cashcollateralized letters of credit with ones issued under our revolving line of credit 

cash used in financing activities in 2012 was mainly comprised of 427 million in payments on our revolving line of credit offset by collections of 151 million from stock option exercises and contributions from the employee stock purchase plan 

  

in 2011 cash used in financing activities was primarily comprised of purchases of treasury shares net of proceeds from stock option exercises borrowings and payments on our revolving credit line and contributions from our employee stock purchase plan during 2011 we purchased 30 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 718 million 

the share repurchase program which was approved by our board of directors was announced in october 2002 and was amended in april and july 2003 october 2004 october 2005 may 2007 may 2008 october 2008 may 2009 july 2010 october 2010 and september 2011 as of december 31 2012 we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to 17 million additional shares of our common stock our share repurchase program allows us to repurchase shares at our discretion and market conditions influence the timing of the buybacks and the number of shares repurchased as well as the volume of employee stock option exercises these share repurchases are funded using our existing cash balances and borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and may occur through open market purchases and transactions structured through investment banking institutions privately negotiated transactions andor other mechanisms there is no expiration date specified for the authorization and we intend to repurchase stock under the plan from time to time 

during 2010 we purchased 36 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 658 million 

in 2012 we issued 12 million shares of common stock and received 124 million in aggregate proceeds upon exercise of stock options in 2011 we received 36 million from the exercise of options to purchase approximately 582000 shares of our common stock under our employee stock option plan and during 2010 we received 32 million from the exercise of options to purchase approximately 615000 shares of our common stock under our employee stock option plan in 2012 2011 and 2010 we received 26 million 20 million and 19 million respectively from contributions to the tyler technologies inc employee stock purchase plan 

we have a 1500 million credit agreement the “credit facility” and a related pledge and security agreement with a group of seven financial institutions with bank of america na as administrative agent the credit facility provides for a revolving credit line of 1500 million which may be increased up to 2000 million subject to our obtaining commitments for such increase with a 250 million sublimit for letters of credit the credit facility matures on august 11 2014 borrowings under the credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes including working capital requirements acquisitions and share repurchases in 2010 we paid 20 million in related debt issuance costs 

borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a rate of either 1 the bank of america’s prime rate plus a margin of 150 to 275 or 2 the 30 60 90 or 180day libor rate plus a margin of 250 to 375 with the margin determined by our consolidated leverage ratio in 2012 and 2011 our effective average interest rate for borrowings was 34 and 33 respectively as of december 31 2012 our interest rate was 27 the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets excluding real property the credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial conditions and prohibits us from making certain investments advances cash dividends or loans and limits incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens as of december 31 2012 we were in compliance with those covenants 

as of december 31 2012 we had 180 million in outstanding borrowings and unused available borrowing capacity of 1261 million under the credit facility in addition as of december 31 2012 our bank had issued outstanding letters of credit totaling 59 million to secure surety bonds required by some of our customer contracts these letters of credit reduce our available borrowing capacity and expire in 2013 

we paid income taxes net of refunds received of 131 million in 2012 134 million in 2011 and 158 million in 2010 

excluding acquisitions and investments in office buildings we anticipate that 2013 capital spending will be between 82 million and 92 million we expect the majority of this capital spending will consist of computer equipment and software for infrastructure replacements and expansion we currently do not expect to capitalize significant amounts related to software development in 2013 but the actual amount and timing of those costs and whether they are capitalized or expensed may result in additional capitalized software development we also plan to spend approximately 148 million in 2013 in connection with the completion of construction of an office building in plano texas capital spending including the construction of an office facility is expected to be funded from existing cash balances and cash flows from operations 

from time to time we engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates in order to pursue such opportunities which could require significant commitments of capital we may be required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive securities in the future no assurance can be given as to our future acquisition opportunities and how such opportunities will be financed 

  

we lease office facilities as well as transportation computer and other equipment used in our operations under noncancelable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through 2021 most leases contain renewal options and some contain purchase options 

summarized in the table below are our obligations to make future payments under our longterm revolving credit agreement and lease obligations at december 31 2012 in thousands 

 

 as of december 31 2012 we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements guarantees to third parties or material purchase commitments except for the operating lease commitments listed above 

capitalization 

at december 31 2012 our capitalization consisted of 180 million in longterm obligations and 1453 million of shareholders’ equity our total debttocapital ratio was 110 at december 31 2012 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial market prices and interest rates as of december 31 2012 we had 180 million in outstanding borrowings under the credit facility these borrowings bear interest at a rate of either 1 the bank of america’s prime rate plus a margin of 150 to 275 or 2 the 30 60 90 or 180day libor rate plus a margin of 250 to 375 with the margin determined by our consolidated leverage ratio in 2012 and 2011 our effective average interest rate for borrowings was 34 and 33 respectively as of december 31 2012 our interest rate was 27 assuming borrowings of 180 million a hypothetical 10 increase in our interest rate at december 31 2012 for a one year period would result in approximately 49000 of additional interest rate expense 

investments availableforsale consist of two ars with stated maturities of 19 to 29 years for which the interest rate is designed to be reset through dutch auctions approximately every 30 days which would have qualified as level 1 under asc 820 fair value measurements however due to events in the credit markets auctions for these securities have not occurred since february 2008 therefore quoted prices in active markets are no longer available and we determined the estimated fair values of these securities as of december 31 2012 utilizing a discounted trinomial model 

in association with this estimate of fair value we have recorded an aftertax temporary unrealized gain on our noncurrent ars of 87000 net of related tax effects of 47000 in 2012 which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our balance sheet we consider the impairment in our ars as temporary because we do not have the intent to sell nor is it morelikelythannot that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their cost basis we believe that this temporary decline in fair value is due entirely to liquidity issues because the underlying assets of these securities are supported by municipal agencies and do not include mortgagebacked securities have redemption features which call for redemption at 100 of par value and have a current credit rating of a or aa the ratings on the ars take into account credit support through insurance policies guaranteeing each of the bonds’ payment of principal and accrued interest if it becomes necessary in addition both ars have had very small partial redemptions at par in the period july 2009 through july 2012 based on our cash and cash equivalents balance expected operating cash flows and a 1500 million revolving credit line we do not believe a lack of liquidity associated with our ars will adversely affect our ability to conduct business and believe we have the ability to hold the securities throughout the currently estimated recovery period we will continue to evaluate any changes in the fair value of our ars and in the future depending upon existing market conditions we may be required to record an otherthantemporary decline in market value

tyler was founded in 1966 prior to 1998 we operated as a diversified industrial conglomerate with operations in various industrial retail and distribution businesses all of which have been divested in 1997 we embarked on a multiphase growth plan focused on serving the specialized information management needs of local governments nationwide in 1998 and 1999 we entered the local government it market through a series of strategic acquisitions of companies in the local government it market 

market overview 

the state and local government market is one of the largest and most decentralized it markets in the country consisting of all 50 states approximately 3000 counties 36000 cities and towns and 13900 school districts this market is also comprised of approximately 37000 special districts and other agencies each with specialized delegated responsibilities and unique information management requirements 

traditionally local government bodies and agencies performed statemandated duties including property assessment record keeping road maintenance law enforcement administration of election and judicial functions and the provision of welfare assistance today a host of emerging and urgent issues are confronting local governments each of which demands a service response these areas include criminal justice and corrections administration and finance public safety health and human services and public works transfers of responsibility from the federal and state governments to county and municipal governments and agencies in these and other areas also place additional service and financial requirements on these local government units in addition constituents of local governments are increasingly demanding improved service and better access to information from public entities as a result local governments recognize the increasing value of information management systems and services to among other things improve revenue collection provide increased access to information and streamline delivery of services to their constituents local government bodies are now recognizing that “egovernment” is an additional responsibility for community development from integrated tax systems to integrated civil and criminal justice information systems many counties and cities have benefited significantly from the implementation of jurisdictionwide systems that allow different agencies or government offices to share data and provide a more comprehensive approach to information management many city and county governmental agencies also have unique individual information management requirements which must be tailored to the specific functions of each particular office 

many local governments also have difficulties attracting and retaining the staff necessary to support their it functions as a result they seek to establish longterm relationships with reliable providers of high quality it products and services such as tyler 

although local governments generally face budgetary constraints in their operations their primary revenue sources are usually property taxes and to a lesser extent utility billings and other fees which historically tend to be relatively stable in addition the acquisition of new technology typically enables local governments to operate more efficiently and often provides a measurable return on investment that justifies the purchase of software and related services 

gartner estimates that state and local government software applications and vertical specific software spending will grow from 125 billion in 2012 to 133 billion in 2015 the professional services and support segments of the market where our business is primarily focused is expected to expand from 328 billion in 2012 to 362 billion in 2015 software sales in the primary and secondary education segments of the market is expected to expand from 22 billion in 2012 to 28 billion in 2015 while professional services and support are expected to grow from 23 billion in 2012 to 26 billion in 2015

historically we have had a greater proportion of our annual revenues in the second half of our fiscal year due to governmental budget and spending cycles and the timing of system implementations for customers desiring to “go live” at the beginning of the calendar year

subscriptionbased services 

subscriptionbased services revenue primarily consists of revenues derived from application service provider “asp” arrangements and other hosted service offerings software subscriptions and disaster recovery services our asp arrangements and other hosted service offerings provide certain software solutions on a “software as a service” basis for customers who do not wish to maintain update and operate these systems or to make large upfront capital expenditures to implement these advanced technologies 

asp arrangements and other hosting services are typically contracted for a period of three to six years other software subscriptions and disaster recovery service arrangements are typically under annual contracts the majority of the asp and other hosting services and software subscriptions also include professional services and maintenance and support services in certain asp arrangements the customer also acquires a license to the software 

we also provide electronic document filing solutions efilings for courts and law offices which simplify the filing and management of court related documents revenues for efilings are included in subscriptionbased revenues and are generally derived from transaction fees 

software services 

we provide a variety of professional it services to customers who utilize our software products virtually all of our customers contract with us for installation training and data conversion services in connection with their purchase of tyler’s software solutions the complete implementation process for a typical system includes planning design data conversion setup and testing at the culmination of the implementation process an installation team travels to the customer’s facility to ensure the smooth transfer of data to the new system installation fees are charged separately to customers on either a fixedfee or hourly charge basis depending on the contract 

both in connection with the installation of new systems and on an ongoing basis we provide extensive training services and programs related to our products and services training can be provided in our training centers onsite at customers’ locations or at meetings and conferences and can be customized to meet customers’ requirements the vast majority of our customers contract with us for training services both to improve their employees’ proficiency and productivity and to fully utilize the functionality of our systems training services are generally billed on an hourly or daily basis along with travel and other expenses

following the implementation of our software systems we provide ongoing software support services to assist our customers in operating the systems and to periodically update the software support is provided over the phone to customers through help desks staffed by our customer support representatives for more complicated issues our staff with the customers’ permission can log on to customers’ systems remotely we maintain our customers’ software largely through releases that contain improvements and incremental additions along with updates necessary because of legislative or regulatory changes 

virtually all of our software customers contract with us for maintenance and support which provides us with a significant source of recurring revenue we generally provide maintenance and support under annual contracts with a typical fee based on a percentage of the software product’s license fee these fees can be increased annually and may also increase as new license fees increase maintenance and support fees are generally paid in advance for the entire maintenance contract period most maintenance contracts automatically renew unless the customer or tyler gives notice of termination prior to expiration similar support is provided to our asp customers and is included in their subscription fees which are classified as subscriptionbased revenues 

appraisal services 

we are the nation’s largest provider of property appraisal outsourcing services for local government taxing authorities these services include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 local government taxing authorities normally reappraise properties from time to time to update values for tax assessment purposes and to maintain equity in the taxing process in some jurisdictions reassessment cycles are mandated by law in others they are discretionary while some taxing jurisdictions perform reappraisals inhouse many local governments outsource this function because of its cyclical nature and because of the specialized knowledge and expertise requirements associated with it our appraisal services business unit has been in this business since 1938 

in some instances we also sell property tax andor appraisal software products in connection with appraisal outsourcing projects while other customers may only engage us to provide appraisal services appraisal outsourcing services are somewhat seasonal in nature to the extent that winter weather conditions reduce the productivity of data collection activities in connection with those projects 

strategy 

our objective is to grow our revenue and earnings internally supplemented by focused strategic acquisitions the key components of our business strategy are to 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

sales marketing and customers 

we market our products and services through direct sales and marketing personnel located throughout the united states other inhouse sales staff focuses on addon sales professional services and support 

sales of new systems are typically generated from referrals from other government offices or departments within a county or municipality referrals from other local governments relationships established between sales representatives and county or local officials contacts at trade shows direct mailings and direct contact from prospects already familiar with us we are active in numerous national state county and local government associations and participate in annual meetings trade shows and educational events 

customers consist primarily of county and municipal agencies school districts and other local government offices in counties customers include the auditor treasurer tax assessorcollector county clerk district clerk county and district court judges probation officers sheriff and county appraiser at municipal government sites customers include directors from various departments including administration finance utilities public works code enforcement personnel purchasing taxation municipal court and police contracts for software products and services are generally implemented over periods of three months to one year with annually renewing maintenance and support update agreements thereafter although either the customer or we can terminate these agreements historically almost all support and maintenance agreements are automatically renewed annually contracts for appraisal outsourcing services are generally one to three years in duration during 2011 approximately 47 of our revenue was attributable to ongoing support and maintenance agreements 

competition 

we compete with numerous local regional and national firms that provide or offer some or many of the same solutions and services that we provide many of these competitors are smaller companies that may be able to offer less expensive solutions than ours many of these firms operate within a specific geographic area andor in a narrow product or service niche we also compete with national firms some of which have greater financial and technical resources than we do including oracle corporation lawson software inc sap ag affiliated computer services inc a unit of xerox corporation sungard data systems inc new world systems american cadastre llc amcad constellation software inc and manatron inc a unit of thomas reuters corporation in addition we sometimes compete with consulting and systems integration firms such as deloitte llp which develop custom systems primarily for larger governments we also occasionally compete with central internal information service departments of local governments which require us to persuade the enduser department to discontinue service by its own personnel and outsource the service to us we compete on a variety of factors including price service name recognition reputation technological capabilities and the ability to modify existing products and services to accommodate the individual requirements of the customer our ability to offer an integrated system of applications for several offices or departments is often a competitive strength local governmental units often are required to seek competitive proposals through a request for proposal process 

suppliers 

substantially all of the computers peripherals printers scanners operating system software office automation software and other equipment necessary for the implementation and provision of our software systems and services are presently available from several thirdparty sources hardware is purchased on original equipment manufacturer or distributor terms at discounts from retail we have not experienced any significant supply problems 

backlog 

at december 31 2011 our estimated revenue backlog was approximately 3398 million compared to 2814 million at december 31 2010 the backlog represents signed contracts under which the revenue has not been recognized as of yearend approximately 2284 million or 67 of the backlog is expected to be recognized during 2012 

  

intellectual property proprietary rights and licenses 

we regard certain features of our internal operations software and documentation as confidential and proprietary and rely on a combination of contractual restrictions trade secret laws and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property we generally do not rely on patents we believe that due to the rapid rate of technological change in the computer software industry trade secrets and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as knowledge ability and experience of our employees frequent product enhancements and timeliness and quality of support services we typically license our software products under nonexclusive license agreements which are generally nontransferable and have a perpetual term 

employees 

at december 31 2011 we had 2091 employees appraisal outsourcing projects are cyclical in nature and can be widely dispersed geographically we often hire temporary employees to assist in these projects whose term of employment generally ends with the project’s completion none of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to collective bargaining agreements we consider our relations with our employees to be positive

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk investors evaluating our company should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this annual report any of the following factors could materially harm our business operating results and financial condition additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business operating results and financial condition this section should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report we may make forwardlooking statements from time to time both written and oral we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forwardlooking statements our actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forwardlooking statements due to a number of factors including those set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report 

risks associated with selling products and services into the public sector marketplace 

declining general economic conditions and uncertainties in the global credit crisis and equity markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the financial market crisis has continued to disrupt credit and equity markets worldwide local and state governments may face financial pressures that could in turn affect our growth rate in 2012 we cannot assure you local and state spending levels will be unaffected by the global credit crisis and if budget shortfalls occur they may negatively impact local and state information technology spending and could have a material adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition 

  

selling products and services into the public sector poses unique challenges 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of software and services to state county and city governments other municipal agencies and other public entities we expect that sales to public sector customers will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues in the future we face many risks and challenges associated with contracting with governmental entities including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 each of these risks is outside our control if we fail to adequately adapt to these risks and uncertainties our financial performance could be adversely affected 

a decline in information technology spending may result in a decrease in our revenues or lower our growth rate 

a decline in the demand for information technology among our current and prospective customers may result in decreased revenues or a lower growth rate for us because our sales depend in part on our customers’ level of funding for new or additional information technology systems and services moreover demand for our solutions may be reduced by a decline in overall demand for computer software and services accordingly we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase or maintain our revenues 

the open bidding process for governmental contracts creates uncertainty in predicting future contract awards 

many governmental agencies purchase products and services through an open bidding process generally a governmental entity will publish an established list of requirements requesting potential vendors to propose solutions for the established requirements to respond successfully to these requests for proposals we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract the time required to establish operations for the proposed client and the likely terms of any other third party proposals submitted we cannot guarantee that we will win any bids in the future through the request for proposal process or that any winning bids will ultimately result in contracts on favorable terms our failure to secure contracts through the open bidding process or to secure such contracts on favorable terms may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we face significant competition from other vendors and potential new entrants into our markets 

we believe we are a leading provider of integrated solutions for the public sector however we face competition from a variety of software vendors that offer products and services similar to those offered by us as well as from companies offering to develop custom software we compete on the basis of a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe the market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors that vary in size primary computer platforms and overall product scope our competitors include consulting firms publicly held companies that focus on selected segments of the public sector market and a significant number of smaller privately held companies certain competitors have greater technical marketing and financial resources than we do we cannot assure you that such competitors will not develop products or offer services that are superior to our products or services or that achieve greater market acceptance 

we also compete with internal centralized information service departments of governmental entities which require us to persuade the enduser to stop the internal service and outsource to us in addition our customers may elect in the future to provide information management services internally through new or existing departments which could reduce the market for our services 

we could face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the public sector software application market and new products and technologies are introduced increased competition could result in pricing pressure fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share in addition current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with thirdparties thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share further competitive pressures could require us to reduce the price of our software licenses and related services we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition 

fixed price contracts may affect our profits 

some of our present contracts are on a fixedpriced basis which can lead to various risks including 

 

  

  

 if we do not adequately assess these and other risks we may be subject to cost overruns and penalties which may harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

changes in the insurance markets may affect our ability to win some contract awards and may lead to increased expenses 

some of our customers primarily those for our property appraisal services require that we secure performance bonds before they will select us as their vendor in addition we are generally required to provide letters of credit as security for the issuance of a performance bond our current credit facility contains a 250 million sublimit for letters of credit we cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure such performance bonds in the future on terms that are favorable to us if at all our inability to obtain performance bonds on favorable terms or at all could impact our future ability to win some contract awards particularly large property appraisal services contracts which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

recent volatility in the stock markets increasing shareholder litigation the adoption of expansive legislation that redefines corporate controls in particular legislation adopted to prevent future corporate and accounting scandals as well as other factors have recently led to volatility in premiums for directors’ and officers’ liability insurance volatility of the insurance market may result in future increases in our general and administrative expenses which may adversely affect future operating results 

risks associated with our periodic results and stock price 

as with other software vendors we may be required to delay revenue recognition into future periods which could adversely impact our operating results 

we have in the past had to and in the future may have to defer revenue recognition for license fees due to several factors including whether 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 because of the factors listed above and other specific requirements under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states for software revenue recognition we must have very precise terms in our license agreements in order to recognize revenue when we initially deliver and install software or perform services negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions can extend the sales cycle and sometimes we do not obtain terms and conditions that permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery or even as work on the project is completed 

we may experience fluctuations in quarterly revenue that could adversely impact our stock price and our operating results 

our actual revenues in a quarter could fall below expectations which could lead to a decline in our stock price our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter revenues from license fees in any quarter depend substantially upon our contracting activity and our ability to recognize revenues in that quarter in accordance with our revenue recognition policies our quarterly revenue may fluctuate and may be difficult to forecast for a variety of reasons including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

 fluctuation in our quarterly revenues may adversely affect our operating results in each fiscal quarter our expense levels operating costs and hiring plans are based to some extent on projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed if our actual revenues fall below expectations we could experience a reduction in operating results 

increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins and adversely affect our operating results 

we realize lower margins on software and appraisal service revenues than on license revenue the majority of our contracts include both software licenses and professional services therefore an increase in the percentage of software service and appraisal service revenue compared to license revenue could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and could adversely affect operating results 

our stock price may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and may be significantly affected by many different factors some examples of factors that can have a significant impact on our stock price include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for the common stock of technology companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company we cannot assure you that similar litigation will not occur in the future with respect to us such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition 

financial outlook 

from time to time in press releases and otherwise we may publish forecasts or other forwardlooking statements regarding our results including estimated revenues or net earnings any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties and as a matter of course any number of them may prove to be incorrect further the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors including those described in this discussion many of which are beyond our control as a result we cannot be certain that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse current and potential stockholders are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions but instead are encouraged to utilize our entire publicly available mix of historical and forwardlooking information as well as other available information regarding us our products and services and the software industry when evaluating our prospective results of operations 

  

risks associated with our software products 

our products are complex and we run the risk of errors or defects with new product introductions or enhancements 

software products as complex as those developed by us may contain errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released although we have not experienced material adverse effects resulting from any such defects or errors to date we cannot assure you that material defects and errors will not be found after commencement of product shipments any such defects could result in loss of revenues or delay market acceptance 

our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims it is possible however that we may not always be able to negotiate such provisions in our contracts with customers or that the limitation of liability provisions contained in our license agreements may not be effective as a result of existing or future federal state or local laws ordinances or judicial decisions although we maintain errors and omissions and general liability insurance and we try to structure our contracts to include limitations on liability we cannot assure you that a successful claim could not be made or would not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we must respond to rapid technological changes to be competitive 

the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards in computer hardware and software technology changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result our future success will depend in part upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products and develop and introduce in a timely manner or acquire new products that keep pace with technological developments satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and costeffective manner further we cannot assure you that the products capabilities or technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive if we are unable to develop or acquire on a timely and costeffective basis new software products or enhancements to existing products or if such new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance our business operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights 

many of our product and service offerings incorporate proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of contracts copyrights and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology we cannot be certain that we have taken all appropriate steps to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property in addition there has been significant litigation in the united states in recent years involving intellectual property rights we are not currently involved in any material intellectual property litigation we may however be a party to intellectual property litigation in the future to protect our proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights further we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us in the future with respect to current or future products any claims or litigation with or without merit could be timeconsuming and result in costly litigation and diversion of management’s attention further any claims and litigation could cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements such royalty or licensing arrangements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all thus litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations regardless of the final outcome of such litigation 

risks associated with our growth strategy and other general corporate risks 

we may experience difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy 

a significant portion of our growth has resulted from strategic acquisitions in new product and geographic markets although our focus is on internal growth we will continue to identify and pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances with suitable candidates our future success will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate future acquisitions and other strategic alliances into our operations acquisitions may involve a number of special risks including diversion of management’s attention failure to retain key acquired personnel unanticipated events or circumstances legal liabilities and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we conduct due diligence reviews of potential acquisition candidates we may not identify all material liabilities or risks related to acquisition candidates there can be no assurance that any such strategic acquisitions or alliances will be accomplished on favorable terms or will result in profitable operations 

  

our failure to properly manage growth could adversely affect our business 

we have expanded our operations since 1998 when we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector we intend to continue expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities this growth places a significant demand on management and operational resources in order to manage growth effectively we must implement and improve our operational systems procedures and controls on a timely basis we must also identify hire train and manage key managerial and technical personnel if we fail to implement these systems or employ and retain such qualified personnel our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to hire integrate and retain qualified personnel 

our continued success will depend upon the availability and performance of our key management sales marketing customer support and product development personnel the loss of key management or technical personnel could adversely affect us we believe that our continued success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract integrate and retain such personnel we have at times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel competition for qualified software development sales and other personnel is intense and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 new securities and exchange commission regulations and new york stock exchange rules are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours the costs required to comply with such evolving laws are difficult to predict to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards this investment may result in an unforeseen increase in general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenuegenerating activities which may harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

historically we have not paid dividends on our common stock 

we have not declared or paid a cash dividend since we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector in 1998 additionally our bank credit agreement contains restrictions on the payment of cash dividends we intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law could deter takeover attempts 

our board of directors may issue up to 1000000 shares of preferred stock and may determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting and conversion rights of these shares of preferred stock these determinations may be made without any further vote or action by our stockholders the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock in addition some provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and of the delaware general corporation law could also delay prevent or make more difficult a merger tender offer or proxy contest involving us

in connection with this transaction we recorded customer relationship of approximately 56 million acquired software of 24 million deferred revenue of 62 million and net assets of 15 million we recorded goodwill of approximately 133 million all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes customer relationships and acquired software will be amortized over a weighted average period of eight years we believe likely market participants for this transaction would be software companies with a presence in the k12 school market therefore the goodwill of 133 million arising from the acquisition is primarily attributed to our ability to maximize the value of the customer base through tyler’s software product suite that targets the k12 school market and to a much lesser extent the assembled workforce of windsor our balance sheet as of december 31 2011 reflects the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 

the operating results of this acquisition are included in our results of operations since the date of acquisition 

outlook 

consistent with 2011 we expect to continue to invest aggressively in product development in 2012 we believe that our competitive position is strong and that we are wellpositioned to take advantage of an eventual return to a stronger economic environment however until we see indications of sustained improvement we are expecting that the new business environment in 2012 will continue to be both challenging and unpredictable and that the majority of our growth will again come from recurring revenues 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements the reported amounts of revenues cost of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosure of contingencies the notes to the financial statements included as part of this annual report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the application of the percentageofcompletion and proportional performance methods of revenue recognition the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of intangible assets determination of sharebased compensation expense and valuation allowance for receivables we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards codification “asc” 605 revenue recognition and asc 985605 software revenue recognition our revenues are derived from sales of software licenses subscriptionbased services appraisal services maintenance and support and services that typically range from installation training and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs for multiple element software arrangements which do not entail the performance of services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software we generally record revenue when the delivered products or performed services result in a legally enforceable and nonrefundable claim we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized because most of our customers are governmental entities we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments in a limited number of cases we encounter a customer who is dissatisfied with some aspect of the software product or our service and we may offer a “concession” to such customer in those limited situations where we grant a concession we rarely reduce the contract arrangement fee but alternatively may perform additional services such as additional training or creating additional custom reports these amounts have historically been nominal in connection with our customer contracts and the adequacy of related allowances and measures of progress towards contract completion our project managers are charged with the responsibility to continually review the status of each customer on a specific contract basis also we review on at least a quarterly basis significant past due accounts receivable and the adequacy of related reserves events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments may require revision include but are not limited to deterioration of a customer’s financial condition failure to manage our customer’s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products 

we use contract accounting primarily the percentageofcompletion method as discussed in asc 60535 construction — type and certain production — type contracts for those software arrangements that involve significant production modification or customization of the software or where our software services are otherwise considered essential to the functionality of the software we measure progresstocompletion primarily using labor hours incurred or value added in addition we recognize revenue using the proportional performance method of revenue recognition for our property appraisal projects some of which can range up to five years these methods rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue billings and collections and expected contract costs as well as measures of progress toward completion we believe reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs and progress applicable to various stages of a contract can be made at times we perform additional andor noncontractual services for little to no incremental fee to satisfy customer expectations if changes occur in delivery productivity or other factors used in developing our estimates of expected costs or revenues we revise our cost and revenue estimates and any revisions are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision first become known in connection with these and certain other contracts we may perform the work prior to when the services are billable andor payable pursuant to the contract the termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the value of products delivered and services performed in the event of an early termination 

for asp and other hosting arrangements we evaluate whether the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and whether the customer can feasibly maintain the software on the customer’s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a third party to host the software if we determine that the 

  

customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and can feasibly maintain the software on the customer’s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a third party to host the software we recognize the license professional services and hosting services revenues pursuant to asc 985605 software revenue recognition for asp and other hosting arrangements that do not meet the criteria for recognition under asc 985605 we account for the elements under asc 60525 multiple element arrangements using all applicable facts and circumstances including whether i the element has standalone value ii there is a general right of return and iii the revenue is contingent on delivery of other elements we allocate the contract value to each element of the arrangement that qualifies for treatment as a separate element based on vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” and if vsoe is not available third party evidence and if third party evidence is unavailable estimated selling price for professional services associated with asp and hosting arrangements that we determine do not have standalone value to the customer or are contingent on delivery of other elements we recognize the services revenue ratably over the remaining contractual period once hosting has gone live and we may begin billing for the hosting services we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 

in connection with certain of our contracts we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet date many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period management reviews unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue in addition we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue which represents billings in excess of revenue earned the majority of this liability consists of maintenance billings for which payments are made in advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the maintenance period generally one year we also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit and the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product has not been met on a periodic basis we review by customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains appropriate 

intangible assets and goodwill  our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge the cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value with the excess allocated to goodwill accordingly we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets including software customer related intangibles trade name and goodwill in addition we capitalize software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility these intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives we currently have no intangible assets with indefinite lives other than goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of april or more frequently if impairment indicators arise we perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the asset’s implied fair value then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference the fair values calculated in our impairment tests are determined using discounted cash flow models involving several assumptions these assumptions include but are not limited to anticipated operating income growth rates our longterm anticipated operating income growth rate and the discount rate our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses the assumptions that are used are based upon what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value assets liabilities and goodwill have been assigned to reporting units based on assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition we evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by comparing the total of the fair value of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed during the second quarter of 2011 did not result in an impairment charge during 2011 we did not identify any triggering events which would require an update to our annual impairment review 

all intangible assets with definite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of other intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows the assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved such indicators may include among others a significant decline in expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate 

  

unanticipated competition and reductions in growth rates in addition products capabilities or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or noncompetitive any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets 

sharebased compensation we have a stock option plan that provides for the grant of stock options to key employees directors and nonemployee consultants we estimate the fair value of sharebased awards on the date of grant using the blackscholes option valuation model sharebased compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures which will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from such estimates changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data we estimate stock price volatility at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock estimated option life is determined using the “simplified method” in accordance with asc 71810 stock compensation determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates 

analysis of results of operations and other 

the following discussion compares the historical results of operations on a basis consistent with gaap for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

   

2011 compared to 2010 

revenues 

software licenses 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software license revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

 in october 2011 we acquired windsor which provides a suite of financial and human capital management software solutions to the k12 education market and is included in our ess segment excluding the impact of this acquisition total software license revenue declined by 8 and ess software license revenue declined 9 compared to 2010 the decrease in software license revenues is mainly attributable to longer sales cycles and postponements of customer purchasing decisions mainly due to budgetary constraints related to economic conditions in addition a portion of the decline was due to a growing number of customers choosing our subscriptionbased options rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement subscriptionbased arrangements result in lower software license revenues in the initial year as compared to traditional perpetual software license arrangements but generate higher overall subscriptionbased services revenue over the term of the contract we had 47 new customers that entered into subscriptionbased arrangements in 2011 compared to 19 new customers in 2010 we expect ess software license revenues in 2012 to be higher than 2011 but the mix of software license arrangements and subscriptionbased arrangements may reduce the degree of the increase 

subscriptions 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our subscription revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

 subscriptionbased services revenue primarily consists of revenues derived from application service provider “asp” arrangements and other hosted service offerings software subscriptions and disaster recovery services we also provide electronic document filing solutions “efilings” for courts and law offices which simplify the filing and management of court related documents revenues from efilings are generally derived from transaction fees asp and other software subscription agreements are typically for periods of three to six years disaster recovery and miscellaneous other hosted service agreements are typically renewable annually new customers for asp and other hosted service offerings as well as existing customers who converted to our asp model provided the majority of the subscription revenue increase together with slightly higher rates for other hosted services in 2011 we added 47 new customers and 40 existing customers elected to convert to our hosted offerings efiling services also contributed approximately 500000 of the subscription revenue increase as a result of several counties and one state adopting or expanding mandatory efiling for court documents in the last half of 2011 

  

software services  

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software services revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

 software services revenues primarily consists of professional services billed in connection with the installation of our software conversion of customer data training customer personnel and consulting new customers who purchase our proprietary software licenses generally also contract with us to provide for the related software services existing customers also periodically purchase additional training consulting and minor programming services excluding the impact of the windsor acquisition software services increased 1 in 2011 software services revenue included more third party vendor services to build certain software interfaces associated with a statewide contract and reflected slightly higher billing rates 

maintenance  

the following table sets forth a comparison of our maintenance revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

 we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and certain third party software excluding the impact of the windsor acquisition maintenance revenue grew 7 from 2010 this increase was due to growth in our installed customer base and slightly higher maintenance rates on most of our product lines our annual maintenance revenue growth rate has been reduced somewhat by the effect of existing installed customers converting to our hosted offering which results in a loss of maintenance revenue offset by a larger increase in subscription revenue 

appraisal services  

the following table sets forth a comparison of our appraisal service revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

 appraisal services revenue increased 13 in 2011 compared to 2010 the appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states we began work on several new large revaluation contracts in late 2009 and mid2010 which provided the majority of the increase in appraisal services revenues several of these large contracts were completed in the last half of 2011 and we expect appraisal revenues for 2012 will decline slightly compared to 2011 

  

cost of revenues and gross margins 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

 the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the years ended december 31 

 

 software license and acquired software  cost of software license and acquired software is comprised of third party software costs amortization of acquired software and amortization of capitalized development costs on certain software products cost of third party software comprised approximately 70 of our cost of software license revenues in 2011 compared to approximately 60 of our cost of software license in 2010 third party software sales were slightly higher than the prior year 

costs of acquired software which is comprised of amortization expense for software acquired through acquisitions was approximately 27 of our cost of software license revenues in 2011 compared to approximately 32 of our cost of software license in 2010 we completed several acquisitions in the period 2007 through 2011 and these costs are being amortized over a weighted average period of approximately five years cost of acquired software declined because several products became fully amortized early 2011 

the remaining cost of software license balance relates to amortization expense for capitalized development cost which is determined on a productbyproduct basis at an annual rate not less than straightline basis over the product’s estimated life which is generally five years these costs comprised less than 10 of total software license and acquired software costs in 2011 and 2010 we did not capitalize any internal software development costs in 2011 or 2010 

in 2011 our software license gross margin percentage increased compared to the prior year period because several acquired software solutions became fully amortized in early 2011 

software services maintenance and subscriptionbased services  cost of software services maintenance and subscriptions primarily consists of personnel costs related to installation of our software conversion of customer data training customer personnel and support activities and various other services such as asp efilings and disaster recovery maintenance and various other services such as asp and disaster recovery costs typically grow at a slower rate than related revenues due to leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale in 2011 the software services maintenance and subscriptions gross margin increased compared to the prior year partly because we improved our utilization of our support and maintenance staff and due to annual rate increases on certain services we are managing costs and staff levels to ensure they are in line with demand for professional services excluding 56 additional employees added with the windsor acquisition our implementation and support staff declined by 4 employees since december 31 2010 

  

appraisal services  our appraisal services gross margin was flat compared to 2010 a high proportion of the costs of appraisal services revenue are variable as we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects whose term of employment generally ends with the projects’ completion 

our blended gross margin for 2011 increased 14 from 2010 mainly due to leverage in the utilization of our support maintenance and subscriptionbased services staff and economies of scale and slightly higher rates on certain services the gross margin also benefited from lower acquired software amortization costs 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses consist primarily of salaries employee benefits travel sharebased compensation expense commissions and related overhead costs for administrative and sales and marketing employees as well as professional fees trade show activities advertising costs and other marketing related costs the following table sets forth a comparison of our sga expenses for the following years ended december 31 

 

 sga as a percentage of revenues was 245 in 2011 compared to 241 in 2010 sga expenses in 2011 included costs associated with consolidating office space in our new yarmouth maine facility and other facilities related costs 

research and development expense 

research and development expense consists primarily of salaries employee benefits and related overhead costs associated with product development the following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the years ended december 31 

 

 research and development expense consist mainly of costs associated with development of new products and new software platforms from which we do not currently generate revenue these include the microsoft dynamics ax project as well as other new product development efforts related to our proprietary products we increased our research and development staff by seven employees during 2011 in january 2007 we entered into a software development and license agreement which provides for a strategic alliance with microsoft corporation “microsoft” to jointly develop core public sector functionality for microsoft dynamics ax to address the accounting needs of public sector organizations worldwide in september 2007 tyler and microsoft signed an amendment to the software development and license agreement which grants microsoft intellectual property rights in and to certain portions of the software code provided and developed by tyler into microsoft dynamics ax products to be marketed and sold outside of the public sector in exchange for reimbursement payments to partially offset the research and development costs in april 2011 tyler and microsoft entered into an amended and superseded master software development and license agreement which among other things grants microsoft intellectual property rights in the remaining portions of the software code developed by tyler in exchange for certain other concessions under the new agreement tyler will continue to receive the previously agreed to reimbursement payments in addition tyler has agreed to commit certain resources to the development of the next version of dynamics ax and will receive software and maintenance royalties on direct and indirect sales of the solutions codeveloped under this arrangement 

our research and development expense increased 24 million in 2011 compared to 2010 the increase is mainly due to lower reimbursements from microsoft in 2011 in 2011 we offset our research and development expense by 35 million which were the amounts earned under the terms of our agreement with microsoft compared to 51 million in 2010 prior to december 31 2010 we received offsets from microsoft to our research and development expense of approximately 850000 each quarter from mid2008 through the end of 2010 as specified in a statement of work under the amended software development and license agreement with microsoft in addition in october 2009 the scope of the project was further expanded which will result in additional offsets to research and development expense varying in amount from quarter to quarter through 2012 for a total of approximately 62 million as of december 31 2011 we have recorded 52 million in cumulative offsets under this agreement from microsoft and expect to record the remaining 10 million in the last half of 2012 the actual amount and timing of future research and development costs and related reimbursements and whether they are capitalized or expensed are subject to change 

  

amortization of customer and trade name intangibles 

acquisition intangibles are comprised of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that is allocated to acquired software and customer and trade name intangibles the remaining excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues while amortization expense of customer and trade name intangibles is recorded as other operating expense the estimated useful lives of both customer and trade name intangibles are five to 25 years the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the years ended december 31 

 

 in october 2011 we completed an acquisition that increased amortizable customer and trade name intangibles by approximately 56 million this amount is being amortized over 10 years 

estimated annual amortization expense relating to customer and trade name acquisition intangibles excluding acquired software for which the amortization expense is recorded as cost of revenues for the next five years is as follows in thousands 

 

 other 

the following table sets forth a comparison of other expense net for the following years ended december 31 

 

 other expense is primarily comprised of interest expense nonusage and other fees associated with our revolving line of credit agreement interest expense was higher in 2011 than 2010 due to higher debt levels associated with our stock repurchases and the acquisition of windsor in october 2011 the effective interest rate in 2011 was 33 compared to 34 in 2010 

  

income tax provision 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the years ended december 31 

 

 the effective income tax rates for both years were different from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of 35 due to state income taxes nondeductible sharebased compensation expense the qualified manufacturing activities deduction the research and development tax credit and nondeductible meals and entertainment costs 

approximately 35 of our stock option expense is related to incentive stock options “isos” as such a tax benefit is not recorded at the time the compensation cost related to the options is recorded for book purposes due to the fact that an iso does not ordinarily result in a tax benefit unless there is a disqualifying disposition nonqualified stock options result in the creation of a deferred tax asset which is a temporary difference until the time that the option is exercised due to the treatment of isos for tax purposes our effective tax rate from year to year is subject to variability 

2010 compared to 2009 

revenues 

software licenses  

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software license revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

 in 2010 ess software license revenues recognized declined substantially compared to the prior year period the decrease in software license revenues is mainly attributable to longer sales cycles and postponements of customer purchasing decisions mainly due to budgetary constraints related to economic conditions in addition a portion of the decline was due to a number of customers choosing our subscriptionbased options rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement 

  

subscriptions 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our subscription revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

 in january 2010 we acquired wiznet inc which provides primarily subscriptionbased electronic document filing solutions for courts and law offices and is included in our ess segment excluding the impact of this acquisition ess and total subscription revenues grew by 18 in 2010 existing customers who converted to our asp model as well as new customers for asp and other hosted service offerings provided the majority of the subscription revenue increase with the remaining increase due to slightly higher rates for disaster recovery services 

software services  

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software service revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

 the decline in software services revenues in 2010 is principally due to lower new software license contract activity in recent quarters due to weak economic conditions in addition the increase in the mix of customers choosing our subscriptionbased solutions was a factor contributing to lower software services revenues 

maintenance  

the following table sets forth a comparison of our maintenance revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

 maintenance revenues increased due to growth in our installed customer base and slightly higher maintenance rates on most of our product lines our annual maintenance and support growth rate has declined compared to previous year’s growth rate due to a number of customers converting to asp arrangements as well as new customers choosing our subscriptionbased options rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement 

  

appraisal services  

the following table sets forth a comparison of our appraisal service revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

 appraisal services revenue increased 10 in 2010 compared to 2009 the appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states we substantially completed several large appraisal projects mid2009 we began several new revaluation contracts in late 2009 which contributed to the revenue growth in 2010 

cost of revenues and gross margin 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

 the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the years ended december 31 

 

 software license and acquired software  cost of third party software comprised approximately 60 of our cost of software license revenues in 2010 compared to approximately 69 of our cost of software license in 2009 third party software sales declined due to lower proprietary software sales 

costs of acquired software comprises approximately 32 of our cost of software license revenues in 2010 compared to approximately 21 of our cost of software license in 2009 cost of acquired software includes amortization expense for software acquired through acquisitions 

the balance is made up of amortization of capitalized development costs on other software products we did not capitalize any internal software development costs in 2010 or 2009 

  

in 2010 our software license gross margin percentage increased compared to the prior year period because our product mix included less third party software 

software services maintenance and subscriptionbased services  in 2010 the software services maintenance and subscriptions gross margin increased compared to the prior year partly because maintenance and various other services such as asp and disaster recovery costs typically grow at a slower rate than related revenues due to leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale as well as annual rate increases on certain services 

appraisal services  our appraisal services gross margin declined compared to 2009 our appraisal services gross margin in 2009 included the positive impact of cost savings and operational efficiencies experienced on an unusually complex reappraisal project that ended in mid2009 

our blended gross margin for 2010 increased compared to 2009 due to lower third party software expense which offset the impact of a revenue mix that included less software license revenues the gross margin also benefited from leverage in the utilization of our support maintenance and subscriptionbased service staff and economies of scale and slightly higher rates on certain services 

selling general and administrative expenses 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our sga expenses for the years ended december 31 

 

 sga expenses declined in 2010 compared to 2009 due to lower commission costs and marketing expenses which were offset somewhat by higher sharebased compensation expense marketing expenses in 2009 include costs associated with the launch of a new corporate branding initiative 

research and development expense 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the years ended december 31 

 

 research and development expense consist of costs associated with the microsoft dynamics ax project in addition to costs associated with other new product development efforts in 2010 and 2009 we offset our research and development expense by 51 million and 35 million respectively which were the amounts earned under the terms of our agreement with microsoft 

amortization of customer and trade name intangibles 

the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the years ended december 31 

 

 in january 2010 we completed an acquisition that increased amortizable customer and trade name intangibles by approximately 55 million this amount is being amortized over 10 years 

  

other 

the following table sets forth a comparison of other expense net for the years ended december 31 

 

 in 2010 over half of other expense is comprised of interest expense nonusage and other fees associated with a credit agreement entered into in august 2010 other expense in 2009 is mainly comprised of interest expense nonusage fees and other bank fees interest expense was higher in 2010 than 2009 due to higher debt levels associated with our stock repurchases in addition the effective interest rate in 2010 was 34 compared to 18 in 2009 

income tax provision 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the years ended december 31 

 

 our effective income tax rate declined compared to 2009 mainly due to a 579000 research and development tax credit in 2010 in addition to the impact of the research and development tax credit in 2010 the effective income tax rates for both years were different from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of 35 due to state income taxes nondeductible sharebased compensation expense the qualified manufacturing activities deduction and nondeductible meals and entertainment costs 

financial condition and liquidity 

as of december 31 2011 we had cash and cash equivalents of 13 million and investments availableforsale of 20 million compared to cash and cash equivalents of 21 million and investments availableforsale of 22 million at december 31 2010 as of december 31 2011 we had 607 million outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit totaling 83 million some of our customers primarily those for our property appraisal services require that we secure performance bonds before they will select us as a vendor the maximum potential amount of an outstanding performance bond would be the remaining cost of work to be performed under our contracts the notional amount of performance guarantees outstanding as of december 31 2011 was estimated to be 613 million we provide letters of credit as security for the issuance of performance bonds we do not believe these letters of credit will be required to be drawn upon these letters of credit expire through mid2012 we believe our 1500 million revolving line of credit provides us with sufficient flexibility to meet our longterm financial needs 

the following table sets forth a summary of cash flows for the years ended december 31 

 

 net cash provided by operating activities continues to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures other potential capital resources include cash on hand public and private issuances of debt and equity securities and bank borrowings it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets in the future may be limited by economic conditions or other factors we currently believe that cash provided by operating activities cash on hand and available credit are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures income tax obligations and share repurchases for at least the next twelve months 

  

in 2011 operating activities provided net cash of 564 million primarily generated from net income of 276 million noncash depreciation and amortization charges of 107 million and noncash sharebased compensation expense of 63 million working capital excluding cash declined 177 million mainly due to the timing of payments on income tax liabilities and higher accrued bonus liabilities in 2011 compared to 2010 as a result of improved financial performance our accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances were also higher than 2010 due to an increase in annual software maintenance billings as a result of growth in our installed customer base in addition our growth in subscriptionbased arrangements has also contributed to larger deferred revenue balances 

in general changes in the balance of deferred revenue are cyclical and primarily driven by the timing of our maintenance renewal billings our renewal dates occur throughout the year but our heaviest renewal cycles occur in the second and fourth quarters 

at december 31 2011 our days sales outstanding “dsos” were 99 days compared to dsos of 102 days at december 31 2010 dsos are calculated based on accounts receivable excluding longterm receivables but including unbilled receivables divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by 360 days 

investments availableforsale consist of two auction rate municipal securities “ars” which are collateralized debt obligations supported by municipal agencies and do not include mortgagebacked securities shortterm investments availableforsale consists of a portion of one of these ars which was partially redeemed at par during the period january 1 2012 through february 23 2012 these ars are debt instruments with stated maturities of 20 to 30 years for which the interest rate is designed to be reset through dutch auctions approximately every 30 days however due to events in the credit markets auctions for these securities have not occurred since february 2008 both of our ars have had very small partial redemptions at par in the period from july 2009 through february 2012 as of december 31 2011 we have continued to earn and collect interest on both of our ars because quoted prices in active markets are no longer available we determined the estimated fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted trinomial model the model considers the probability of three potential occurrences for each auction event through the maturity date of each ars the three potential outcomes for each auction are i successful auctionearly redemption ii failed auction and iii issuer default inputs in determining the probabilities of the potential outcomes include but are not limited to the securities’ collateral credit rating insurance issuer’s financial standing contractual restrictions on disposition and the liquidity in the market the fair value of each ars is determined by summing the present value of the probabilityweighted future principal and interest payments determined by the model since there can be no assurances that auctions for these securities will be successful in the near future we have classified our ars as noncurrent investments 

in connection with this estimate of fair value we have recorded an aftertax temporary unrealized loss on our noncurrent ars of 80000 net of related tax effects of 43000 in 2011 which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our balance sheet 

we consider the impairment in our ars as temporary because we do not have the intent to sell nor is it morelikelythannot that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their cost basis we believe that this temporary decline in fair value is due entirely to liquidity issues because the underlying assets of these securities are supported by municipal agencies and do not include mortgagebacked securities have redemption features which call for redemption at 100 of par value and have a current credit rating of a or aa the ratings on the ars take into account credit support through insurance policies guaranteeing each of the bonds’ payment of principal and accrued interest if it becomes necessary in addition both ars have had very small partial redemptions at par in the period july 2009 through february 2012 based on our cash and cash equivalents balance of 13 million expected operating cash flows and a 1500 million revolving credit line we do not believe a lack of liquidity associated with our ars will adversely affect our ability to conduct business and believe we have the ability to hold the securities throughout the currently estimated recovery period we will continue to evaluate any changes in the fair value of our ars and in the future depending upon existing market conditions we may be required to record an otherthantemporary decline in market value

new accounting pronouncements 

accounting standards update “asu” 201108 amends existing guidance by giving an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that is a likelihood of more than 50 that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if this is the case companies will need to perform a more detailed twostep goodwill impairment test which is used to identify potential goodwill impairments and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment losses to be recognized if any asu 201108 will be effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 which for us will be in our 2012 second quarter with early adoption permitted we do not believe the adoption of this update will have a material impact on our financial statements 

in june 2011 the fasb issued asu 201105 presentation of comprehensive income which amends certain guidance in asc 220 comprehensive income asu 201105 revises the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements asu 201105 removes the presentation options in asc 220 and requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either 1 a continuous statement of comprehensive income or 2 two separate but consecutive statements asu 201105 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2011 and will be applied on a retrospective basis

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial market prices and interest rates as of december 31 2011 we had 607 million in outstanding borrowings under the credit facility these borrowings bear interest at a rate of either 1 the bank of america’s prime rate plus a margin of 150 to 275 or 2 the 30 60 90 or 180day libor rate plus a margin of 250 to 375 with the margin determined by our consolidated leverage ratio in 2011 and 2010 our effective average interest rate for borrowings was 33 and 34 respectively as of december 31 2011 our interest rate was 34 assuming borrowings of 607 million a hypothetical 10 increase in our interest rate at december 31 2011 for a one year period would result in approximately 206000 of additional interest rate expense 

investments availableforsale consist of two ars with stated maturities of 20 to 30 years for which the interest rate is designed to be reset through dutch auctions approximately every 30 days which would have qualified as level 1 under asc 820 fair value measurements however due to events in the credit markets auctions for these securities have not occurred since february 2008 therefore quoted prices in active markets are no longer available and we determined the estimated fair values of these securities as of december 31 2011 utilizing a discounted trinomial model 

in association with this estimate of fair value we have recorded an aftertax temporary unrealized loss on our noncurrent ars of 80000 net of related tax effects of 43000 in 2011 which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our balance sheet we consider the impairment in our ars as temporary because we do not have the intent to sell nor is it morelikelythannot that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their cost basis we believe that this temporary decline in fair value is due entirely to liquidity issues because the underlying assets of these securities are supported by municipal agencies and do not include mortgagebacked securities have redemption features which call for redemption at 100 of par value and have a current credit rating of a or aa the ratings on the ars take into account credit support through insurance policies guaranteeing each of the bonds’ payment of principal and accrued interest if it becomes necessary in addition both ars have had very small partial redemptions at par in the period july 2009 through february 2012 based on our cash and cash equivalents balance of 13 million expected operating cash flows and a 1500 million revolving credit line we do not believe a lack of liquidity associated with our ars will adversely affect our ability to conduct business and believe we have the ability to hold the securities throughout the currently estimated recovery period we will continue to evaluate any changes in the fair value of our ars and in the future depending upon existing market conditions we may be required to record an otherthantemporary decline in market value

tyler was founded in 1966 prior to 1998 we operated as a diversified industrial conglomerate with operations in various industrial retail and distribution businesses all of which have been divested in 1997 we embarked on a multiphase growth plan focused on serving the specialized information management needs of local governments nationwide in 1998 and 1999 we entered the local government it market through a series of strategic acquisitions of companies in the local government it market 

market overview 

the state and local government market is one of the largest and most decentralized it markets in the country consisting of all 50 states approximately 3000 counties 36000 cities and towns and 13900 school districts this market is also comprised of approximately 35000 special districts and other agencies each with specialized delegated responsibilities and unique information management requirements 

traditionally local government bodies and agencies performed statemandated duties including property assessment record keeping road maintenance law enforcement administration of election and judicial functions and the provision of welfare assistance today a host of emerging and urgent issues are confronting local governments each of which demands a service response these areas include criminal justice and corrections administration and finance public safety health and human services and public works transfers of responsibility from the federal and state governments to county and municipal governments and agencies in these and other areas also place additional service and financial requirements on these local government units in addition constituents of local governments are increasingly demanding improved service and better access to information from public entities as a result local governments recognize the increasing value of information management systems and services to among other things improve revenue collection provide increased access to information and streamline delivery of services to their constituents local government bodies are now recognizing that “egovernment” is an additional responsibility for community development from integrated tax systems to integrated civil and criminal justice information systems many counties and cities have benefited significantly from the implementation of jurisdictionwide systems that allow different agencies or government offices to share data and provide a more comprehensive approach to information management many city and county governmental agencies also have unique individual information management requirements which must be tailored to the specific functions of each particular office 

many local governments also have difficulties attracting and retaining the staff necessary to support their it functions as a result they seek to establish longterm relationships with reliable providers of high quality it products and services such as tyler 

although local governments generally face budgetary constraints in their operations their primary revenue sources are usually property taxes and to a lesser extent utility billings and other fees which historically tend to be relatively stable in addition the acquisition of new technology typically enables local governments to operate more efficiently and often provides a measurable return on investment that justifies the purchase of software and related services 

gartner estimates that state and local government software applications and vertical specific software spending will grow from 86 billion in 2011 to 100 billion in 2014 the professional services and support segments of the market where our business is primarily focused is expected to expand from 325 billion in 2011 to 379 billion in 2014 software sales in the primary and 

secondary education segments of the market is expected to expand from 11 billion in 2011 to 14 billion in 2014 while professional services and support are expected to grow from 22 billion in 2011 to 26 billion in 2014

customers consist primarily of county and municipal agencies school districts and other local government offices in counties customers include the auditor treasurer tax assessorcollector county clerk district clerk county and district court judges probation officers sheriff and county appraiser at municipal government sites customers include directors from various departments including administration finance utilities public works code enforcement personnel purchasing taxation municipal court and police contracts for software products and services are generally implemented over periods of three months to one year with annually renewing maintenance and support update agreements thereafter although either the customer or we can terminate these agreements historically almost all support and maintenance agreements are automatically renewed annually contracts for appraisal outsourcing services are generally one to three years in duration during 2010 approximately 47 of our revenue was attributable to ongoing support and maintenance agreements 

competition 

we compete with numerous local regional and national firms that provide or offer some or many of the same solutions and services that we provide most of these competitors are smaller companies that may be able to offer less expensive solutions than ours many of these firms operate within a specific geographic area andor in a narrow product or service niche we also compete with national firms some of which have greater financial and technical resources than we do including oracle corporation lawson software inc sap ag affiliated computer services inc sungard data systems inc new world systems american cadastre llc amcad constellation software inc and manatron inc in addition we sometimes compete with consulting and systems integration firms such as deloitte llp which develop custom systems primarily for larger governments we also occasionally compete with central internal information service departments of local governments which require us to persuade the enduser department to discontinue service by its own personnel and outsource the service to us we compete on a variety of factors including price service name recognition reputation technological capabilities and the ability to modify existing products and services to accommodate the individual requirements of the customer our ability to offer an integrated system of applications for several offices or departments is often a competitive strength local governmental units often are required to seek competitive proposals through a request for proposal process 

suppliers 

substantially all of the computers peripherals printers scanners operating system software office automation software and other equipment necessary for the implementation and provision of our software systems and services are presently available from several thirdparty sources hardware is purchased on original equipment manufacturer or distributor terms at discounts from retail we have not experienced any significant supply problems 

backlog 

at december 31 2010 our estimated revenue backlog was approximately 2814 million compared to 2331 million at december 31 2009 the backlog represents signed contracts under which the revenue has not been recognized as of yearend approximately 1971 million of the backlog is expected to be recognized during 2011 

intellectual property proprietary rights and licenses 

we regard certain features of our internal operations software and documentation as confidential and proprietary and rely on a combination of contractual restrictions trade secret laws and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property we generally do not rely on patents we believe that due to the rapid rate of technological change in the computer software industry trade secrets and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as knowledge ability and experience of our employees frequent product enhancements and timeliness and quality of support services we typically license our software products under nonexclusive license agreements which are generally nontransferable and have a perpetual term 

employees 

at december 31 2010 we had 2054 employees appraisal outsourcing projects are cyclical in nature and can be widely dispersed geographically we often hire temporary employees to assist in these projects whose term of employment generally ends with the project’s completion none of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to collective bargaining agreements we consider our relations with our employees to be positive

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk investors evaluating our company should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this annual report any of the following factors could materially harm our business operating results and financial condition additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business operating results and financial condition this section should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report we may make forwardlooking statements from time to time both written and oral we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forwardlooking statements our actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forwardlooking statements due to a number of factors including those set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report 

risks associated with selling products and services into the public sector marketplace 

declining general economic conditions and uncertainties in the global credit crisis and equity markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the financial market crisis has continued to disrupt credit and equity markets worldwide local and state governments may face financial pressures that could in turn affect our growth rate in 2011 we cannot assure you local and state spending levels will be unaffected by the global credit crisis and if budget shortfalls occur they may negatively impact local and state information technology spending and could have a material adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition 

selling products and services into the public sector poses unique challenges 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of software and services to state county and city governments other municipal agencies and other public entities we expect that sales to public sector customers will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues in the future we face many risks and challenges associated with contracting with governmental entities including 

 

each of these risks is outside our control if we fail to adequately adapt to these risks and uncertainties our financial performance could be adversely affected 

a decline in information technology spending may result in a decrease in our revenues or lower our growth rate 

a decline in the demand for information technology among our current and prospective customers may result in decreased revenues or a lower growth rate for us because our sales depend in part on our customers’ level of funding for new or additional information technology systems and services moreover demand for our solutions may be reduced by a decline in overall demand for computer software and services accordingly we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase or maintain our revenues 

the open bidding process for governmental contracts creates uncertainty in predicting future contract awards 

many governmental agencies purchase products and services through an open bidding process generally a governmental entity will publish an established list of requirements requesting potential vendors to propose solutions for the established requirements to respond successfully to these requests for proposals we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract the time required to establish operations for the proposed client and the likely terms of any other third party proposals submitted we cannot guarantee that we will win any bids in the future through the request for proposal process or that any winning bids will ultimately result in contracts on favorable terms our failure to secure contracts through the open bidding process or to secure such contracts on favorable terms may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face significant competition from other vendors and potential new entrants into our markets 

we believe we are a leading provider of integrated solutions for the public sector however we face competition from a variety of software vendors that offer products and services similar to those offered by us as well as from companies offering to develop custom software we compete on the basis of a number of factors including 

 

we believe the market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors that vary in size primary computer platforms and overall product scope our competitors include consulting firms publicly held companies that focus on selected segments of the public sector market and a significant number of smaller privately held companies certain competitors have greater technical marketing and financial resources than we do we cannot assure you that such competitors will not develop products or offer services that are superior to our products or services or that achieve greater market acceptance 

we also compete with internal centralized information service departments of governmental entities which require us to persuade the enduser to stop the internal service and outsource to us in addition our customers may elect in the future to provide information management services internally through new or existing departments which could reduce the market for our services 

we could face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the public sector software application market and new products and technologies are introduced increased competition could result in pricing pressure fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share in addition current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with thirdparties thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share further competitive pressures could require us to reduce the price of our software licenses and related services we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition 

fixed price contracts may affect our profits 

some of our present contracts are on a fixedpriced basis which can lead to various risks including 

 

if we do not adequately assess these and other risks we may be subject to cost overruns and penalties which may harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

changes in the insurance markets may affect our ability to win some contract awards and may lead to increased expenses 

some of our customers primarily those for our property appraisal services require that we secure performance bonds before they will select us as their vendor the number of qualified highrated insurance companies that offer performance bonds has decreased in recent years while the costs associated with securing these bonds has increased dramatically in addition we are generally required to issue a letter of credit as security for the issuance of a performance bond our current credit facility contains a 250 million sublimit for letters of credit we cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure such performance bonds in the future on terms that are favorable to us if at all our inability to obtain performance bonds on favorable terms or at all could impact our future ability to win some contract awards particularly large property appraisal services contracts which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

recent volatility in the stock markets increasing shareholder litigation the adoption of expansive legislation that redefines corporate controls in particular legislation adopted to prevent future corporate and accounting scandals as well as other factors have recently led to significant increases in premiums for directors’ and officers’ liability insurance the number of insurers offering directors and officers insurance at competitive rates has also decreased in recent years volatility of the insurance market may result in future increases in our general and administrative expenses which may adversely affect future operating results 

risks associated with our periodic results and stock price 

as with other software vendors we may be required to delay revenue recognition into future periods which could adversely impact our operating results 

we have in the past had to and in the future may have to defer revenue recognition for license fees due to several factors including whether 

 

because of the factors listed above and other specific requirements under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states for software revenue recognition we must have very precise terms in our license agreements in order to recognize revenue when we initially deliver and install software or perform services negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions can extend the sales cycle and sometimes we do not obtain terms and conditions that permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery or even as work on the project is completed 

we may experience fluctuations in quarterly revenue that could adversely impact our stock price and our operating results 

our actual revenues in a quarter could fall below expectations which could lead to a decline in our stock price our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter revenues from license fees in any quarter depend substantially upon our contracting activity and our ability to recognize revenues in that quarter in accordance with our revenue recognition policies our quarterly revenue may fluctuate and may be difficult to forecast for a variety of reasons including the following 

 

 

 

fluctuation in our quarterly revenues may adversely affect our operating results in each fiscal quarter our expense levels operating costs and hiring plans are based to some extent on projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed if our actual revenues fall below expectations we could experience a reduction in operating results 

increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins and adversely affect our operating results 

we realize lower margins on software and appraisal service revenues than on license revenue the majority of our contracts include both software licenses and professional services therefore an increase in the percentage of software service and appraisal service revenue compared to license revenue could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and could adversely affect operating results 

our stock price may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and may be significantly affected by many different factors some examples of factors that can have a significant impact on our stock price include 

 

in addition the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for the common stock of technology companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company we cannot assure you that similar litigation will not occur in the future with respect to us such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition 

financial outlook 

from time to time in press releases and otherwise we may publish forecasts or other forwardlooking statements regarding our results including estimated revenues or net earnings any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties and as a matter of course any number of them may prove to be incorrect further the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors including those described in this discussion many of which are beyond our control as a result we cannot be certain that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse current and potential stockholders are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions but instead are encouraged to utilize our entire publicly available mix of historical and forwardlooking information as well as other available information regarding us our products and services and the software industry when evaluating our prospective results of operations 

risks associated with our software products 

our products are complex and we run the risk of errors or defects with new product introductions or enhancements 

software products as complex as those developed by us may contain errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released although we have not experienced material adverse effects resulting from any such defects or errors to date we cannot assure you that material defects and errors will not be found after commencement of product shipments any such defects could result in loss of revenues or delay market acceptance 

our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims it is possible however that we may not always be able to negotiate such provisions in our contracts with customers or that the limitation of liability provisions contained in our license agreements may not be effective as a result of existing or future federal state or local laws ordinances or judicial decisions although we maintain errors and omissions and general liability insurance and we try to structure our contracts to include limitations on liability we cannot assure you that a successful claim could not be made or would not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we must respond to rapid technological changes to be competitive 

the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards in computer hardware and software technology changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result our future success will depend in part upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products and develop and introduce in a timely manner or acquire new products that keep pace with technological developments satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and costeffective manner further we cannot assure you that the products capabilities or technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive if we are unable to develop or acquire on a timely and costeffective basis new software products or enhancements to existing products or if such new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance our business operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights 

many of our product and service offerings incorporate proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of contracts copyrights and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology we cannot be certain that we have taken all appropriate steps to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property in addition there has been significant litigation in the united states in recent years involving intellectual property rights we are not currently involved in any material intellectual property litigation we may however be a party to intellectual property litigation in the future to protect our proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights further we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us in the future with respect to current or future products any claims or litigation with or without merit could be timeconsuming and result in costly litigation and diversion of management’s attention further any claims and litigation could cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements such royalty or licensing arrangements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all thus litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations regardless of the final outcome of such litigation 

risks associated with our growth strategy and other general corporate risks 

we may experience difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy 

in addition a significant portion of our growth has resulted from strategic acquisitions in new product and geographic markets although our focus is on internal growth we will continue to identify and pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances with suitable candidates our future success will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate future acquisitions and other strategic alliances into our operations acquisitions may involve a number of special risks including diversion of management’s attention failure to retain key acquired personnel unanticipated events or circumstances legal liabilities and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we conduct due diligence reviews of potential acquisition candidates we may not identify all material liabilities 

or risks related to acquisition candidates there can be no assurance that any such strategic acquisitions or alliances will be accomplished on favorable terms or will result in profitable operations 

our failure to properly manage growth could adversely affect our business 

we have expanded our operations since 1998 when we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector we intend to continue expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities this growth places a significant demand on management and operational resources in order to manage growth effectively we must implement and improve our operational systems procedures and controls on a timely basis we must also identify hire train and manage key managerial and technical personnel if we fail to implement these systems or employ and retain such qualified personnel our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to hire integrate and retain qualified personnel 

our continued success will depend upon the availability and performance of our key management sales marketing customer support and product development personnel the loss of key management or technical personnel could adversely affect us we believe that our continued success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract integrate and retain such personnel we have at times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel competition for qualified software development sales and other personnel is intense and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 new securities and exchange commission regulations and new york stock exchange rules are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours the costs required to comply with such evolving laws are difficult to predict to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards this investment may result in an unforeseen increase in general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities which may harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

historically we have not paid dividends on our common stock 

we have not declared or paid a cash dividend since we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector in 1998 additionally our bank credit agreement contains restrictions on the payment of cash dividends we intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law could deter takeover attempts 

our board of directors may issue up to 1000000 shares of preferred stock and may determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting and conversion rights of these shares of preferred stock these determinations may be made without any further vote or action by our stockholders the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock in addition some provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and of the delaware general corporation law could also delay prevent or make more difficult a merger tender offer or proxy contest involving us

overview 

general 

we provide integrated information management solutions and services for the public sector with a focus on local governments we develop and market a broad line of software products and services to address the information technology “it” needs of cities counties schools and other local government entities in addition we provide professional it services to our customers including software and hardware installation data conversion training and for certain customers product modifications along with continuing maintenance and support for customers using our systems we also provide subscriptionbased services such as hosted solutions as well as property appraisal outsourcing services for taxing jurisdictions 

our products generally automate three major functional areas 1 financial management and education 2 courts and justice and 3 property appraisal and tax and we report our results in two segments the enterprise software solutions “ess” segment provides municipal and county governments and schools with software systems to meet their information technology and automation needs for missioncritical “backoffice” functions such as financial management and courts and justice processes the appraisal and tax software solutions and services “atss” segment provides systems and software that automate the appraisal and assessment of real and personal property as well as property appraisal outsourcing services for local governments and taxing authorities property appraisal outsourcing services include the physical inspection of commercial and residential properties data collection and processing computer analysis for property valuation preparation of tax rolls community education and arbitration between taxpayers and the assessing jurisdiction 

we monitor and analyze several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance these indicators include the following 

 

 

 

acquisitions 

in january 2010 we acquired all the assets of wiznet inc “wiznet” for a cash purchase price of 95 million wiznet provides electronic document filing solutions for courts and law offices throughout the united states and is integrated with our primary courts and justice solution 

in connection with this transaction we acquired total tangible assets of approximately 867000 we recorded goodwill of approximately 26 million all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes and other intangible assets of approximately 61 million the 61 million of intangible assets is attributable to customer relationships and acquired software that will be amortized over a weighted average period of approximately nine years our balance sheet as of december 31 2010 reflects the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 

the operating results of this acquisition are included in our results of operations since the date of acquisition 

outlook 

consistent with 2010 we expect to continue to invest aggressively in product development in 2011 we believe that our competitive position is strong and that we are wellpositioned to take advantage of an eventual return to a stronger economic environment however until we see signs of sustained improvement we expect that the new business environment in 2011 will continue to be both challenging and unpredictable and that growth will again come primarily from recurring revenues 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements the reported amounts of revenues cost of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosure of contingencies the notes to the financial statements included as part of this annual report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the application of the percentageofcompletion and proportionate performance methods of revenue recognition the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of intangible assets determination of sharebased compensation expense and valuation allowance for receivables we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards codification “ asc” 605 revenue recognition and asc 985605 software revenue recognition our revenues are derived from sales of software licenses subscriptionbased services appraisal services maintenance and support and services that typically range from installation training and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs for multiple element software arrangements which do not entail the performance of services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software we generally record revenue when the delivered products or performed services result in a legally enforceable and nonrefundable claim we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized because most of our customers are governmental entities we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments in a limited number of cases we encounter a customer who is dissatisfied with some aspect of the software product or our service and we may offer a “concession” to such customer in those limited situations where we grant a concession we rarely reduce the contract arrangement fee but alternatively may perform additional services such as additional training or creating additional custom reports these amounts have historically been nominal in connection with our customer contracts and the adequacy of related allowances and measures of progress towards contract completion our project managers are charged with the responsibility to continually review the status of each customer on a specific contract basis also we review on at least a quarterly basis significant past due accounts receivable and the adequacy of related reserves events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments may require revision include but are not limited to deterioration of a customer’s financial condition failure to manage our customer’s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products 

we use contract accounting primarily the percentageofcompletion method as discussed in asc 60535 construction — type and certain production — type contracts for those software arrangements that involve significant production modification or customization of the software or where our software services are otherwise considered essential to the functionality of the software we measure progresstocompletion primarily using labor hours incurred or value added in addition we recognize revenue using the proportionate performance method of revenue recognition for our property appraisal projects some of which can range up to five years these methods rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue billings and collections and expected contract costs as well as measures of progress toward completion we believe reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs and progress applicable to various stages of a contract can be made at times we perform additional andor noncontractual services for little to no incremental fee to satisfy customer expectations if changes occur in delivery productivity or other factors used in developing our estimates of expected costs or revenues we revise our cost and revenue estimates and any revisions are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision first become known in connection with these and certain other contracts we may perform the work prior to when the services are billable andor payable pursuant to the contract the termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the fair value of products delivered and services performed in the event of an early termination 

for asp and other hosting arrangements we evaluate whether the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and whether the customer can feasibly maintain the software on the customer’s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a third party to host the software if we determine that the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty 

and can feasibly maintain the software on the customer’s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a third party to host the software we recognize the license professional services and hosting services revenues pursuant to asc 985605 software revenue recognition for asp and other hosting arrangements that do not meet the criteria for recognition under asc 985605 we account for the elements under asc 60525 multiple element arrangements using all applicable facts and circumstances including whether i the element has standalone value ii there is a general right of return and iii the revenue is contingent on delivery of other elements we allocate revenue to each element of the arrangement that qualifies for treatment as a separate element based on vsoe and if vsoe is not available third party evidence and if third party evidence is unavailable estimated selling price for professional services associated with asp and hosting arrangements that we determine do not have standalone value to the customer or are contingent on delivery of other elements we recognize the services revenue ratably over the remaining contractual period once hosting has gone live and we may begin billing for the hosting services we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 

in connection with certain of our contracts we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet date many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period management reviews unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue in addition we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue which represents billings in excess of revenue earned the majority of this liability consists of maintenance billings for which payments are made in advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the maintenance period generally one year we also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit and the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product has not been met on a periodic basis we review by customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains appropriate 

intangible assets and goodwill  our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge the cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value with the excess allocated to goodwill accordingly we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets including software customer related intangibles trade name and goodwill in addition we capitalize software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility these intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives all intangible assets with definite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 

recoverability of goodwill is generally measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its fair value generally determined by estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of april or more frequently if impairment indicators arise an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair value the fair values calculated in our impairment tests are determined using discounted cash flow models involving several assumptions these assumptions include but are not limited to anticipated operating income growth rates our longterm anticipated operating income growth rate and the discount rate our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses the assumptions that are used are based upon what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value we have identified two reporting units for impairment testing our reporting units are the same as our reportable segments and consistent with the reporting units tested for impairment in prior years assets liabilities and goodwill have been assigned to reporting units based on assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition we evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by comparing the total of the fair value of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 

recoverability of other intangible assets is generally measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows the assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved such indicators may include among others a significant decline in expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition and reductions in growth rates in addition products capabilities or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or noncompetitive any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed during the second quarter of 2010 did not result in an impairment charge during 2010 we did not identify any triggering events which would require an update to our annual impairment review a 

hypothetical 10 decrease in the fair value of either of our reporting units as of december 31 2010 would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill 

sharebased compensation we have a stock option plan that provides for the grant of stock options to key employees directors and nonemployee consultants we estimate the fair value of sharebased awards on the date of grant using the blackscholes option valuation model sharebased compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures which will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from such estimates changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data we estimate stock price volatility at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock estimated option life is determined using the “simplified method” in accordance with asc 71810 stock compensation determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates 

analysis of results of operations and other 

the following discussion compares the historical results of operations on a basis consistent with gaap for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

2010 compared to 2009 

  revenues 

software licenses 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software license revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

in 2010 we signed 58 large new contracts with average software license fees of approximately 440000 compared to 74 large new contracts signed in 2009 with average software license fees of approximately 307000 we consider contracts with a license fee component of 100000 or more to be large although a contract is signed in a particular year the year in which the revenue is recognized may be different because we recognize revenue according to our revenue recognition policy as described in note 1 in the notes to financial statements 

in 2010 ess software license revenues recognized declined substantially compared to the prior year period the decrease in software license revenues is mainly attributable to longer sales cycles to negotiate and close contracts that have reached the request for proposal phase and postponement of customer purchasing decisions mainly due to budgetary constraints related to economic conditions the software installation period for a substantial number of our ess solutions is relatively short and delays in the timing of signing new contracts will impact our results in the short term in addition a portion of the decline was due to a number of customers choosing our subscriptionbased options rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement subscriptionbased arrangements result in lower software license revenues in the initial year as compared to traditional perpetual software license arrangements but generate higher overall subscriptionbased services revenue over the term of the contract we expect ess software license revenues in 2011 to be flat compared to 2010 

atss software license revenue is substantially dependent on revaluation cycles which are cyclical and in part driven by statutory revaluation cycles in various states in addition local government taxing authorities generally do not purchase a new software license for each revaluation cycle 

subscriptions 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our subscription revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

subscriptionbased services revenue primarily consists of revenues derived from application service provider “asp” arrangements and other hosted service offerings software subscriptions and disaster recovery services in january 2010 we acquired wiznet which provides primarily subscriptionbased electronic document filing solutions for courts and law offices and is included in our ess segment excluding the impact of this acquisition ess and total subscription revenues grew by 18 in 2010 asp and other software subscription agreements are typically for periods of three to six years and automatically renew unless either party cancels the agreement disaster recovery and miscellaneous other hosted service agreements are typically 

renewable annually existing customers who converted to our asp model as well as new customers for asp and other hosted service offerings provided the majority of the subscription revenue increase with the remaining increase due to slightly higher rates for disaster recovery services in 2010 50 existing customers elected to transfer to our asp model and we added 19 new customers 

software services  

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software services revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

software services revenues primarily consists of professional services billed in connection with the installation of our software conversion of customer data training customer personnel and consulting new customers who purchase our proprietary software licenses generally also contract with us to provide for the related software services as well existing customers also periodically purchase additional training consulting and minor programming services the decline in software services revenues in 2010 is principally due to lower new software license contract activity in recent quarters due to weak economic conditions in addition the increase in the mix of customers choosing our subscriptionbased solutions was a factor in lower software services revenues 

maintenance  

the following table sets forth a comparison of our maintenance revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and third party software maintenance revenues increased 9 in 2010 compared to 2009 this increase was due to growth in our installed customer base and slightly higher maintenance rates on most of our product lines our annual maintenance and support growth rate has declined compared to previous year’s growth rate due to a number of customers converting to asp arrangements as well as new customers choosing our subscriptionbased options rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement 

appraisal services  

the following table sets forth a comparison of our appraisal service revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

appraisal services revenue increased 10 in 2010 compared to 2009 the appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states we substantially completed several large appraisal projects mid2009 we began several new revaluation contracts in late 2009 which contributed to the revenue growth in 2010 we expect appraisal revenues for 2011 will be moderately higher than 2010 

  cost of revenues and gross margins 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the years ended december 31 

 

software license and acquired software  cost of software license and acquired software is comprised of third party software costs amortization of acquired software and amortization expense for capitalized development costs on certain software products cost of third party software comprised approximately 60 of our cost of software license revenues in 2010 compared to approximately 69 of our cost of software license in 2009 third party software sales declined due to lower proprietary software sales new software license sales are a significant driver of third party license sales costs of acquired software comprises approximately 32 of our cost of software license revenues in 2010 compared to approximately 21 of our cost of software license in 2009 cost of acquired software includes amortization expense for software acquired through acquisitions we completed several acquisitions in the period 2007 through 2010 and these costs are being amortized over a weighted average period of approximately five years the balance is made up of amortization of capitalized development costs on other software products amortization expense for capitalized development cost is determined on a productbyproduct basis at an annual rate not less than straightline basis over the product’s estimated life which is generally five years development costs consist mainly of personnel costs such as salary and benefits paid to our developers and rent for related office space we did not capitalize any internal software development costs in 2010 or 2009 

in 2010 our software license gross margin percentage increased compared to the prior year period because our product mix included less third party software third party software has a lower gross margin than proprietary software solutions 

software services maintenance and subscriptionbased services  cost of software services maintenance and subscriptions primarily consists of personnel costs related to installation of our software conversion of customer data training customer personnel and support activities and various other services such as asp and disaster recovery in 2010 the software services maintenance and subscriptions gross margin increased compared to the prior year partly because maintenance and various other services such as asp and disaster recovery costs typically grow at a slower rate than related revenues due to leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale as well as annual rate increases on certain services we are also managing costs and staff levels to ensure they are in line with demand for professional services our implementation and support staff has declined by 61 employees since december 31 2009 

appraisal services  our appraisal services gross margin declined compared to 2009 our appraisal services gross margin in 2009 included the positive impact of cost savings and operational efficiencies experienced on an unusually complex reappraisal project that ended in mid2009 in addition a high proportion of the costs of appraisal services revenue are variable as we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects whose term of employment generally ends with the projects’ completion 

our blended gross margin for 2010 increased compared to 2009 due to lower third party software expense which offset the impact of a revenue mix that included less software license revenues the gross margin also benefited from leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale and slightly higher rates on certain services 

  selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses consist primarily of salaries employee benefits travel sharebased compensation expense commissions and related overhead costs for administrative and sales and marketing employees as well as professional fees trade show activities advertising costs and other marketing related costs the following table sets forth a comparison of our sga expenses for the following years ended december 31 

 

sga expenses declined in 2010 compared to 2009 due to lower commission costs and marketing expenses which were offset somewhat by higher sharebased compensation expense marketing expenses in 2009 include costs associated with the launch of a new corporate branding initiative 

  research and development expense 

research and development expense consists primarily of salaries employee benefits and related overhead costs associated with product development and enhancements and upgrades provided to existing customers under maintenance plans the following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the following years ended december 31 

 

research and development expense consists of costs associated with development of new products and new software platforms from which we do not currently generate revenue these include the microsoft dynamics ax project as well as other new product development efforts in 2010 approximately twothirds of the increase in gross research and development expense relates to investments in new product development other than microsoft dynamics ax we have increased our research and development efforts as we continue to make investments in existing and new products that we believe will enhance our competitive position and drive longterm revenue growth we have increased our development staff by 27 employees since december 31 2009 in january 2007 we entered into a software development and license agreement which provides for a strategic alliance with microsoft corporation “microsoft” to jointly develop core public sector functionality for microsoft dynamics ax to address the accounting needs of public sector organizations worldwide in september 2007 tyler and microsoft signed an amendment to the software development and license agreement which grants microsoft intellectual property rights in and to certain portions of the software code provided and developed by tyler into microsoft dynamics ax products to be marketed and sold outside of the public sector in exchange for reimbursement payments to partially offset the research and development costs 

in 2010 and 2009 we offset our research and development expense by 51 million and 35 million respectively which were the amounts earned under the terms of our agreement with microsoft in september 2008 tyler and microsoft signed a statement of work under the amended software development and license agreement for which we expected to recognize offsets to our research and development expense by approximately 850000 each quarter through the end of 2010 in addition in october 2009 the scope of the project was further expanded which will result in additional offsets to research and development expense varying in amount from quarter to quarter through mid2012 for a total of approximately 62 million as of december 31 2010 we have received 11 

million and expect to receive the remaining 51 million through mid2012 the actual amount and timing of future research and development costs and related reimbursements and whether they are capitalized or expensed may vary we currently expect that for 2011 we will recognize less reimbursement from microsoft than we did in 2010 due to changes in the timing of deployment of resources 

  amortization of customer and trade name intangibles 

acquisition intangibles are comprised of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that is allocated to acquired software and customer and trade name intangibles the remaining excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues while amortization expense of customer and trade name intangibles is recorded as other operating expense the estimated useful lives of both customer and trade name intangibles are five to 25 years the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the following years ended december 31 

 

in january 2010 we completed one acquisition which increased amortizable customer and trade name intangibles by approximately 55 million this amount will be amortized over 10 years 

estimated annual amortization expense relating to customer and trade name acquisition intangibles excluding acquired software for which the amortization expense is recorded as cost of revenues for the next five years is as follows in thousands 

 

  other 

the following table sets forth a comparison of other expense net for the following years ended december 31 

 

in 2010 over half of other expense is comprised of interest expense nonusage and other fees associated with a credit agreement entered into in august 2010 other expense in 2009 is mainly comprised of interest expense nonusage fees and other bank fees interest expense was higher in 2010 than 2009 due to higher debt levels associated with our stock repurchases in addition the effective interest rate in 2010 was 34 compared to 18 in 2009 

  income tax provision 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the following years ended december 31 

 

our effective income tax rate declined compared to 2009 mainly due to a 579000 research and development tax credit in 2010 in addition to the impact of the research and development tax credit in 2010 the effective income tax rate for both years were different from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of 35 due to state income taxes nondeductible sharebased compensation expense the qualified manufacturing activities deduction and nondeductible meals and entertainment costs 

approximately 35 of our stock option expense is derived from incentive stock options “isos” as such a tax benefit is not recorded at the time the compensation cost related to the options is recorded for book purposes due to the fact that an iso does not ordinarily result in a tax benefit unless there is a disqualifying disposition nonqualified stock options result in the creation of a deferred tax asset which is a temporary difference until the time that the option is exercised due to the treatment of isos for tax purposes our effective tax rate from year to year is subject to variability 

2009 compared to 2008 

  revenues 

software licenses  

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software license revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

we acquired several student information and financial management solutions for k12 schools from january through august 2008 excluding the impact of these acquisitions ess software license revenue would have declined approximately 900000 in mid2009 our sales cycle to negotiate and close contracts which have reached the request for proposal phase lengthened slightly mainly due to budgetary constraints related to declining economic conditions as a result the purchasing processes for some of our customers were extended to include more approval and documentation requirements in addition a few contracts included requirements to construct interfaces to existing systems or other essential functionality which results in recognizing revenue over a longer period of time 

atss software license revenue is substantially dependent on revaluation cycles which are cyclical and in part driven by statutory revaluation cycles in various states in addition local government taxing authorities generally do not purchase a new software license for each revaluation cycle 

subscriptions 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our subscription revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

excluding the impact of acquisitions ess subscription revenues grew 16 in 2009 compared to 2008 this increase was due to new customers for asp and other hosted service offerings as well as existing customers converting to asp arrangements and slightly higher rates for disaster recovery services 

software services  

the following table sets forth a comparison of our software service revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

excluding the impact of acquisitions ess software services revenue increased 9 compared to 2008 this increase was mainly due to additions to our implementation and support staff as well as leverage in the utilization of our implementation and support staff and slightly higher rates on some arrangements 

maintenance  

the following table sets forth a comparison of our maintenance revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

excluding the impact of acquisitions total maintenance revenues increased 14 in 2009 compared to 2008 excluding the impact of acquisitions ess maintenance and support services grew 15 and astt maintenance and support services grew 8 in 2009 compared to 2008 this increase was due to growth in our installed customer base and slightly higher maintenance rates on most of our product lines 

appraisal services  

the following table sets forth a comparison of our appraisal service revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

appraisal services revenue declined 2 in 2009 compared to 2008 the appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states we substantially completed several large appraisal projects mid 2009 

  cost of revenues and gross margin 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues for the years ended december 31 

 

the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the years ended december 31 

 

software license and acquired software  amortization expense for capitalized development costs on certain software products comprised approximately 15 of our cost of software license revenues in 2009 compared to approximately 50 of our cost of software license in 2008 the remaining balance is made up of third party software costs 

cost of acquired software includes amortization expense for software acquired through acquisitions in late 2008 software associated with one significant acquisition completed in december 2003 became fully amortized 

in 2009 our software license gross margin percentage rose significantly compared to the prior year period because several products became fully amortized in late 2008 as did software acquired related to a significant acquisition in december 2003 

software services maintenance and subscriptionbased services  in 2009 the software services maintenance and subscriptions gross margin increased compared to the prior year partly because maintenance and various other services such as asp and disaster recovery costs typically grow at a slower rate than related revenues due to leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and 

economies of scale the software services maintenance and subscriptionbased services gross margin also benefited from slightly higher rates for certain services 

appraisal services  our appraisal gross margin increased compared to 2008 as the result of cost savings and operational efficiencies experienced on an unusually complex project a high proportion of the costs of appraisal services revenue are variable as we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects whose term of employment generally ends with the projects’ completion 

our blended gross margin for 2009 was higher than 2008 due to lower amortization expense of software development costs described above the gross margin also benefited from leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale and slightly higher rates on certain services 

  selling general and administrative expenses 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our sga expenses for the following years ended december 31 

 

the increase in sga expenses included higher sharebased compensation expense commission costs and marketing expenses marketing expenses in 2009 include costs associated with the launch of a new corporate branding initiative 

  research and development expense 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the following years ended december 31 

 

research and development expense consist of costs associated with the microsoft dynamics ax project in addition to costs associated with other new product development efforts in 2009 and 2008 we offset our research and development expense by 35 million and 18 million respectively which were the amounts earned under the terms of our agreement with microsoft 

  amortization of customer and trade name intangibles 

the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the following years ended december 31 

 

in 2009 we completed several acquisitions and purchased certain software assets to complement our tax and appraisal solutions and our student information management solutions 

  noncash legal settlement related to warrants 

on june 27 2008 we settled outstanding litigation related to the warrants owned by bank of america n a “ bana” as disclosed in prior sec filings the warrants entitled bana to acquire 16 million shares of tyler common stock at an exercise price of 250 per share following courtordered mediation in july 2008 bana paid us 20 million and we issued to bana 801883 restricted shares of tyler common stock accordingly we recorded a noncash legal settlement related to warrants charge of 90 million which was not tax deductible 

  other 

other expense income in 2009 and 2008 includes nonusage and other fees associated with a credit agreement entered into in october 2008 other income in 2008 also included 11 million of interest income which declined due to significantly lower invested cash balances in 2009 our invested cash balances declined due to purchases of treasury stock and investments in office facilities in late 2008 and 2009 

  income tax provision 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the following years ended december 31 

 

our 2009 effective income tax rate declined compared to 2008 mainly due to a noncash legal settlement related to warrants charge of 90 million in 2008 which was not deductible in addition to the impact of the nondeductible noncash legal settlement charge in 2008 the effective income tax rate for both years were different from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of 35 due to state income taxes nondeductible sharebased compensation expense the qualified manufacturing activities deduction and nondeductible meals and entertainment costs 

financial condition and liquidity 

as of december 31 2010 we had cash and cash equivalents of 21 million and current and noncurrent investments of 22 million compared to cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash equivalents of 157 million and current and noncurrent investments of 20 million at december 31 2009 as of december 31 2010 we had 265 million outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit totaling 83 million to secure surety bonds required by some of our customer contracts these letters of credit expire through mid2011 

the following table sets forth a summary of cash flows for the years ended december 31 

 

net cash provided by operating activities continues to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures other capital resources include cash on hand public and private issuances of debt and equity securities and bank borrowings it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets in the future may be limited by economic conditions or other factors we currently believe that cash provided by operating activities cash on hand and available credit are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures income tax obligations and share repurchases for the foreseeable future 

in 2010 operating activities provided net cash of 354 million primarily generated from net income of 251 million noncash depreciation and amortization charges of 108 million noncash sharebased compensation expense of 61 million offset by an increase in working capital of 48 million the increase in working capital was due to lower accounts payable and accrued liabilities pertaining to the timing of payments on vendor invoices and income tax liabilities in 2010 we adopted a new companywide vacation policy and as a result paid approximately 18 million to reduce accrued vacation balances in 2010 in connection with changing the policy in addition accrued bonus liabilities are smaller in 2010 compared to 2009 as a result of financial performance our accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances were also higher than 2009 due to an increase in annual software maintenance billings as a result of growth in our installed customer base 

in general changes in the balance of deferred revenue are cyclical and primarily driven by the timing of our maintenance renewal billings our renewal dates occur throughout the year but our heaviest renewal cycles occur in the second and fourth quarters 

noncurrent investments availableforsale consist of two auction rate municipal securities “ars” which are collateralized debt obligations supported by municipal agencies and do not include mortgagebacked securities shortterm investments availableforsale consists of a portion of one of these ars which was partially redeemed at par during the period january 1 2011 through february 24 2011 these ars are debt instruments with stated maturities ranging from 21 to 32 years for which the interest rate is designed to be reset through dutch auctions approximately every 30 days however due to events in the credit markets auctions for these securities have not occurred since february 2008 both of our ars have had very small partial redemptions at par in the period from july 2009 through february 2011 as of december 31 2010 we have continued to earn and collect interest on both of our ars because quoted prices in active markets are no longer available we determined the estimated fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted trinomial model the model considers the probability of three potential occurrences for each auction event through the maturity date of each ars the three potential outcomes for each auction are i successful auctionearly redemption ii failed auction and iii issuer default inputs in determining the probabilities of the potential outcomes include but are not limited to the securities’ collateral credit rating insurance issuer’s financial standing contractual restrictions on disposition and the liquidity in the market the fair value of each ars is determined by summing the present value of the probabilityweighted future principal and interest payments determined by the model since there can be no assurances that auctions for these securities will be successful in the near future we have classified our ars as noncurrent investments 

in association with this estimate of fair value we have recorded an aftertax temporary unrealized gain on our noncurrent ars of 130000 net of related tax effects of 70000 in 2010 which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our balance sheet 

we consider the impairment in our ars as temporary because we do not have the intent to sell nor is it morelikelythannot that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their cost basis we believe that this temporary decline in fair value is due entirely to liquidity issues because the underlying assets of these securities are supported by municipal agencies and do not include mortgagebacked securities have redemption features which call for redemption at 100 of par value and have a current credit rating of a or aa the ratings on the ars take into account credit support through insurance policies guaranteeing each of the bonds’ payment of principal and accrued interest if it becomes necessary in addition both ars have had very small partial redemptions at par in the period july 2009 through february 2011 based on our cash and cash equivalents balance of 21 million expected operating cash flows and a 1500 million revolving credit line we do not believe a lack of liquidity associated with our ars will adversely affect our ability to conduct business and believe we have the ability to hold the securities throughout the currently estimated recovery period we will continue to evaluate any changes in the fair value of our ars and in the future depending upon existing market conditions we may be required to record an otherthantemporary decline in market value 

at december 31 2010 our days sales outstanding “dsos” were 102 days compared to dsos of 98 days at december 31 2009 dsos are calculated based on accounts receivable excluding longterm receivables but including unbilled receivables divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by 360 days

on august 11 2010 we terminated our revolving bank credit agreement and a related pledge and security agreement which had been scheduled to mature october 19 2010 and entered into a new 1500 million credit agreement the “credit facility” and a related pledge and security agreement with a group of seven financial institutions with bank of america na as administrative agent the credit facility provides for a revolving credit line of 1500 million which may be increased up to 2000 million subject to our obtaining commitments for such increase with a 250 million sublimit for letters of credit the credit facility matures on august 11 2014 borrowings under the credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes including working capital requirements acquisitions and share repurchases in 2010 we paid 20 million in related debt issuance costs which are included with sundry assets on the accompanying balance sheet

excluding acquisitions and investments in land or office buildings we anticipate that 2011 capital spending will be between 50 million and 55 million we expect the majority of our capital spending in 2011 will consist of computer equipment and software for infrastructure replacements and expansion we currently do not expect to capitalize significant amounts related to software development in 2011 but the actual amount and timing of those costs and whether they are capitalized or expensed may result in additional capitalized software development capital spending in 2011 is expected to be funded from existing cash balances and cash flows from operations 

from time to time we engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates in order to pursue such opportunities which could require significant commitments of capital we may be required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive securities in the future no assurance can be given as to our future acquisition opportunities and how such opportunities will be financed

new accounting pronouncements 

effective january 1 2010 we adopted the provisions of accounting standards update asu 200913 multiple element arrangements asu 200913 updates the existing multipleelement revenue arrangements guidance currently included in asc 60525 multiple element arrangements the revised guidance provides for two significant changes to the existing multipleelement revenue guidance for arrangements that are not accounted for under asc 985605 software revenue recognition the first change relates to the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multipleelement arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting the second change modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables together these changes will result in earlier recognition of service revenue for certain of our asp and hosting arrangements than under previous guidance the adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial market prices and interest rates our investments availableforsale consist of auction rate municipal securities “ars” which are collateralized debt obligations supported by municipal agencies and do not include mortgagebacked securities 

as of december 31 2010 we had 265 million in outstanding borrowings under the credit facility these borrowings bear interest at a rate of either 1 the bank of america’s prime rate plus a margin of 150 to 275 or 2 the 30 60 90 or 180day libor rate plus a margin of 250 to 375 with the margin determined by our consolidated leverage ratio in 2010 and 2009 our effective average interest rate for borrowings was 34 and 18 respectively as of december 31 2010 our interest rate was 27 assuming borrowings of 265 million a hypothetical 10 increase in our interest rate at december 31 2010 for a one year period would result in approximately 72000 of additional interest rate expense 

noncurrent investments availableforsale consist of two ars with stated maturities ranging from 21 to 32 years for which the interest rate is designed to be reset through dutch auctions approximately every 30 days which would have qualified as level 1 under asc 820 fair value measurements however due to events in the credit markets auctions for these securities have not occurred since february 2008 therefore quoted prices in active markets are no longer available and we determined the estimated fair values of these securities as of december 31 2010 utilizing a discounted trinomial model 

in association with this estimate of fair value we have recorded an aftertax temporary unrealized gain on our noncurrent ars of 130000 net of related tax effects of 70000 in 2010 which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our balance sheet we consider the impairment in our ars as temporary because we do not have the intent to sell nor is it morelikelythannot that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their cost basis we believe that this temporary decline in fair value is due entirely to liquidity issues because the underlying assets of these securities are supported by municipal agencies and do not include mortgagebacked securities have redemption features which call for redemption at 100 of par value and have a current credit rating of a or aa the ratings on the ars take into account credit support through insurance policies guaranteeing each of the bonds’ payment of principal and accrued interest if it becomes necessary in addition both ars have had very small partial redemptions at par in the period july 2009 through february 2011 based on our cash and cash equivalents balance of 21 million expected operating cash flows and a 1500 million revolving credit line we do not believe a lack of liquidity associated with our ars will adversely affect our ability to conduct business and believe we have the ability to hold the securities throughout the currently estimated recovery period we will continue to evaluate any changes in the fair value of our ars and in the future depending upon existing market conditions we may be required to record an otherthantemporary decline in market value

tyler was founded in 1966 prior to 1998 we operated as a diversified industrial conglomerate with operations in various industrial retail and distribution businesses all of which have been divested in 1997 we embarked on a multiphase growth plan focused on serving the specialized information management needs of local governments nationwide in 1998 and 1999 we entered the local government it market through a series of strategic acquisitions of companies in the local government it market 

market overview 

the state and local government market is one of the largest and most decentralized it markets in the country consisting of all 50 states approximately 3000 counties 36000 cities and towns and 13900 school districts this market is also comprised of approximately 35000 special districts and other agencies each with specialized delegated responsibilities and unique information management requirements 

traditionally local government bodies and agencies performed statemandated duties including property assessment record keeping road maintenance law enforcement administration of election and judicial functions and the provision of welfare assistance today a host of emerging and urgent issues are confronting local governments each of which demands a service response these areas include criminal justice and corrections administration and finance public safety health and human services and public works transfers of responsibility from the federal and state governments to county and municipal governments and agencies in these and other areas also place additional service and financial requirements on these local government units in addition constituents of local governments are increasingly demanding improved service and better access to information from public entities as a result local governments recognize the increasing value of information management systems and services to among other things improve revenue collection provide increased access to information and streamline delivery of services to their constituents local government bodies are now recognizing that “egovernment” is an additional responsibility for community development from integrated tax systems to integrated civil and criminal justice information systems many counties and cities have benefited significantly from the implementation of jurisdictionwide systems that allow different agencies or government offices to share data and provide a more comprehensive approach to information management many city and county governmental agencies also have unique individual information management requirements which must be tailored to the specific functions of each particular office 

many local governments also have difficulties attracting and retaining the staff necessary to support their it functions as a result they seek to establish longterm relationships with reliable providers of high quality it products and services such as tyler 

although local governments generally face budgetary constraints in their operations their primary revenue sources are usually property taxes and to a lesser extent utility billings which tend to be relatively stable in addition the acquisition of new technology typically enables local governments to operate more efficiently and often provides a measurable return on investment that justifies the purchase of software and related services 

gartner estimates that state and local government it spending will grow from 541 billion in 2010 to 628 billion in 2013 with local government accounting for 281 billion of it spending in 2010 and 318 billion in 2013 the external services and software segments of the market where our business is primarily focused is expected to expand from 153 billion in 2010 to 185 billion in 2013 

products and services 

we provide a comprehensive and flexible suite of products and services that address the information technology needs of cities counties schools and other local government entities we derive our revenues from five primary sources

we also offer certain software solutions on a “software as a service” basis for customers who do not wish to maintain update and operate these systems or to make large upfront capital expenditures to implement these advanced technologies for these customers we host the applications and data at our data centers customers typically pay monthly fees under multiyear contracts for these subscriptionbased services 

historically we have had a greater proportion of our annual revenues in the second half of our fiscal year due to governmental budget and spending cycles and the timing of system implementations for customers desiring to “go live” at the beginning of the calendar year

software services 

we provide a variety of professional it services to customers who utilize our software products virtually all of our customers contract with us for installation training and data conversion services in connection with their purchase of tyler’s software solutions the complete implementation process for a typical system includes planning design data conversion setup and testing at the culmination of the implementation process an installation team travels to the customer’s facility to ensure the smooth transfer of data to the new system installation fees are charged separately to customers on either a fixedfee or hourly charge basis depending on the contract with full passthrough to customers of travel and other outofpocket expenses

appraisal services 

we are the nation’s largest provider of property appraisal outsourcing services for local government taxing authorities these services include 

 

local government taxing authorities normally reappraise properties from time to time to update values for tax assessment purposes and to maintain equity in the taxing process in some jurisdictions reassessment cycles are mandated by law in others they are discretionary while some taxing jurisdictions perform reappraisals inhouse many local governments outsource this function because of its cyclical nature and because of the specialized knowledge and expertise requirements associated with it our appraisal services business unit has been in this business since 1938 

in some instances we also sell property tax andor appraisal software products in connection with appraisal outsourcing projects while other customers may only engage us to provide appraisal services appraisal outsourcing services are somewhat seasonal in nature to the extent that winter weather conditions reduce the productivity of data collection activities in connection with those projects 

strategy 

our objective is to grow our revenue and earnings internally supplemented by focused strategic acquisitions the key components of our business strategy are to 

 

 

 

 

sales marketing and customers 

we market our products and services through direct sales and marketing personnel located throughout the united states other inhouse sales staff focuses on addon sales professional services and support 

sales of new systems are typically generated from referrals from other government offices or departments within a county or municipality referrals from other local governments relationships established between sales representatives and county or local 

officials contacts at trade shows direct mailings and direct contact from prospects already familiar with us we are active in numerous national state county and local government associations and participate in annual meetings trade shows and educational events

competition 

we compete with numerous local regional and national firms that provide or offer some or many of the same solutions and services that we provide most of these competitors are smaller companies that may be able to offer less expensive solutions than ours many of these firms operate within a specific geographic area andor in a narrow product or service niche we also compete with national firms some of which have greater financial and technical resources than we do including oracle corporation lawson software inc sap ag affiliated computer services inc sungard data systems inc new world systems constellation software inc and manatron inc in addition we sometimes compete with consulting and systems integration firms such as bearingpoint inc which develop custom systems primarily for larger governments we also occasionally compete with central internal information service departments of local governments which require us to persuade the enduser department to discontinue service by its own personnel and outsource the service to us we compete on a variety of factors including price service name recognition reputation technological capabilities and the ability to modify existing products and services to accommodate the individual requirements of the customer our ability to offer an integrated system of applications for several offices or departments is often a competitive strength local governmental units often are required to seek competitive proposals through a request for proposal process 

suppliers

intellectual property proprietary rights and licenses 

we regard certain features of our internal operations software and documentation as confidential and proprietary and rely on a combination of contractual restrictions trade secret laws and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property we generally do not rely on patents we believe that due to the rapid rate of technological change in the computer software industry trade secrets and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as knowledge ability and experience of our employees frequent product enhancements and timeliness and quality of support services we typically license our software products under nonexclusive license agreements which are generally nontransferable and have a perpetual term

at december 31 2009 we had 2018 employees appraisal outsourcing projects are cyclical in nature and can be widely dispersed geographically we often hire temporary employees to assist in these projects whose term of employment generally ends with the 

project’s completion none of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to collective bargaining agreements we consider our relations with our employees to be positive

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk investors evaluating our company should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this annual report any of the following factors could materially harm our business operating results and financial condition additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business operating results and financial condition this section should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report we may make forwardlooking statements from time to time both written and oral we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forwardlooking statements our actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forwardlooking statements due to a number of factors including those set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report 

declining general economic conditions and uncertainties in the global credit crisis and equity markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the financial market crisis has continued to disrupt credit and equity markets worldwide local and state governments may face financial pressures that could in turn affect our growth rate in 2010 we cannot assure you local and state spending levels will be unaffected by the global credit crisis and if budget shortfalls occur they may negatively impact local and state information technology spending and could have a material adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition 

a decline in information technology spending may result in a decrease in our revenues or lower our growth rate 

a decline in the demand for information technology among our current and prospective customers may result in decreased revenues or a lower growth rate for us because our sales depend in part on our customers’ level of funding for new or additional information technology systems and services moreover demand for our solutions may be reduced by a decline in overall demand for computer software and services accordingly we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase or maintain our revenues 

selling products and services into the public sector poses unique challenges 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of software and services to state county and city governments other municipal agencies and other public entities we expect that sales to public sector customers will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues in the future we face many risks and challenges associated with contracting with governmental entities including 

 

each of these risks is outside our control if we fail to adequately adapt to these risks and uncertainties our financial performance could be adversely affected 

the open bidding process for governmental contracts creates uncertainty in predicting future contract awards 

many governmental agencies purchase products and services through an open bidding process generally a governmental entity will publish an established list of requirements requesting potential vendors to propose solutions for the established requirements to respond successfully to these requests for proposals we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract the time required to establish operations for the proposed client and the likely terms of any other third party proposals submitted we cannot guarantee that we will win any bids in the future through the request for proposal process or that any winning bids will ultimately result in contracts on favorable terms our failure to secure contracts through the open bidding process or to secure such contracts on favorable terms may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products are complex and we run the risk of errors or defects with new product introductions or enhancements 

software products as complex as those developed by us may contain errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released although we have not experienced material adverse effects resulting from any such defects or errors to date we cannot assure you that material defects and errors will not be found after commencement of product shipments any such defects could result in loss of revenues or delay market acceptance 

our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims it is possible however that we may not always be able to negotiate such provisions in our contracts with customers or that the limitation of liability provisions contained in our license agreements may not be effective as a result of existing or future federal state or local laws ordinances or judicial decisions although we maintain errors and omissions and general liability insurance and we try to structure our contracts to include limitations on liability we cannot assure you that a successful claim could not be made or would not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may experience difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy 

in addition a significant portion of our growth has resulted from strategic acquisitions in new product and geographic markets although our focus is on internal growth we will continue to identify and pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances with suitable candidates our future success will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate future acquisitions and other strategic alliances into our operations acquisitions may involve a number of special risks including diversion of management’s attention failure to retain key acquired personnel unanticipated events or circumstances legal liabilities and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of 

operations although we conduct due diligence reviews of potential acquisition candidates we may not identify all material liabilities or risks related to acquisition candidates there can be no assurance that any such strategic acquisitions or alliances will be accomplished on favorable terms or will result in profitable operations 

we face significant competition from other vendors and potential new entrants into our markets 

we believe we are a leading provider of integrated solutions for the public sector however we face competition from a variety of software vendors that offer products and services similar to those offered by us as well as from companies offering to develop custom software we compete on the basis of a number of factors including 

 

we believe the market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors that vary in size primary computer platforms and overall product scope our competitors include consulting firms publicly held companies that focus on selected segments of the public sector market and a significant number of smaller privately held companies certain competitors have greater technical marketing and financial resources than we do we cannot assure you that such competitors will not develop products or offer services that are superior to our products or services or that achieve greater market acceptance 

we also compete with internal centralized information service departments of governmental entities which require us to persuade the enduser to stop the internal service and outsource to us in addition our customers may elect in the future to provide information management services internally through new or existing departments which could reduce the market for our services 

we could face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the public sector software application market and new products and technologies are introduced increased competition could result in pricing pressure fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share in addition current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with thirdparties thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share further competitive pressures could require us to reduce the price of our software licenses and related services we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the failure to do so would have material adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition 

we must respond to rapid technological changes to be competitive 

the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards in computer hardware and software technology changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result our future success will depend in part upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products and develop and introduce in a timely manner or acquire new products that keep pace with technological developments satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and costeffective manner further we cannot assure you that the products capabilities or technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive if we are unable to develop or acquire on a timely and costeffective basis new software products or enhancements to existing products or if such new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance our business operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to hire integrate and retain qualified personnel 

our continued success will depend upon the availability and performance of our key management sales marketing customer support and product development personnel the loss of key management or technical personnel could adversely affect us we believe that our continued success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract integrate and retain such personnel we have at times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel competition for qualified software development sales and other personnel is intense and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 new securities and exchange commission regulations and new york stock exchange rules are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours the costs required to comply with such evolving laws are difficult to predict to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards this investment may result in an unforeseen increase in general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities which may harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

we may experience fluctuations in quarterly revenue that could adversely impact our stock price and our operating results 

our actual revenues in a quarter could fall below expectations which could lead to a decline in our stock price our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter revenues from license fees in any quarter depend substantially upon our contracting activity and our ability to recognize revenues in that quarter in accordance with our revenue recognition policies our quarterly revenue may fluctuate and may be difficult to forecast for a variety of reasons including the following 

 

fluctuation in our quarterly revenues may adversely affect our operating results in each fiscal quarter our expense levels operating costs and hiring plans are based to some extent on projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed if our actual revenues fall below expectations we could experience a reduction in operating results 

as with other software vendors we may be required to delay revenue recognition into future periods which could adversely impact our operating results 

we have in the past had to and in the future may have to defer revenue recognition for license fees due to several factors including whether 

 

 

because of the factors listed above and other specific requirements under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states for software revenue recognition we must have very precise terms in our license agreements in order to recognize revenue when we initially deliver and install software or perform services negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions can extend the sales cycle and sometimes we do not obtain terms and conditions that permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery or even as work on the project is completed 

increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins and adversely affect our operating results 

we realize lower margins on software and appraisal service revenues than on license revenue the majority of our contracts include both software licenses and professional services therefore an increase in the percentage of software service and appraisal service revenue compared to license revenue could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and could adversely affect operating results 

fixed price contracts may affect our profits 

some of our present contracts are on a fixedpriced basis which can lead to various risks including 

 

if we do not adequately assess these and other risks we may be subject to cost overruns and penalties which may harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

our failure to properly manage growth could adversely affect our business 

we have expanded our operations since february 1998 when we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector we intend to continue expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities this growth places a significant demand on management and operational resources in order to manage growth effectively we must implement and improve our operational systems procedures and controls on a timely basis we must also identify hire train and manage key managerial and technical personnel if we fail to implement these systems or employ and retain such qualified personnel our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights 

many of our product and service offerings incorporate proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of contracts copyrights and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology we cannot be certain that we have taken all appropriate steps to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property in addition there has been significant litigation in the united states in recent years involving intellectual property rights we are not currently involved in any material intellectual property litigation we may however be a party to intellectual property litigation in the future to protect our proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights further we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us in the future with respect to current or future products any claims or litigation with or without merit could be timeconsuming and result in costly litigation and diversion of management’s attention further any claims and litigation could cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements such royalty or licensing arrangements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all thus litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations regardless of the final outcome of such litigation 

changes in the insurance markets may affect our ability to win some contract awards and may lead to increased expenses 

some of our customers primarily those for our property appraisal services require that we secure performance bonds before they will select us as their vendor the number of qualified highrated insurance companies that offer performance bonds has decreased in recent years while the costs associated with securing these bonds has increased dramatically in addition we are generally required to issue a letter of credit as security for the issuance of a performance bond we periodically enter into longterm borrowing agreements and each letter of credit we issue without corresponding cash collateral may reduce our borrowing capacity under the borrowing agreement we cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure such performance bonds in the future on terms that are favorable to us if at all our inability to obtain performance bonds on favorable terms or at all could impact our future ability to win some contract awards particularly large property appraisal services contracts which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

recent volatility in the stock markets increasing shareholder litigation the adoption of expansive legislation that redefines corporate controls in particular legislation adopted to prevent future corporate and accounting scandals as well as other factors have recently led to significant increases in premiums for directors’ and officers’ liability insurance the number of insurers offering directors and officers insurance at competitive rates has also decreased in recent years volatility of the insurance market may result in future increases in our general and administrative expenses which may adversely affect future operating results 

our stock price may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and may be significantly affected by many different factors some examples of factors that can have a significant impact on our stock price include 

 

in addition the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for the common stock of technology companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company we cannot assure you that similar litigation will not occur in the future with respect to us such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition 

historically we have not paid dividends on our common stock 

we have not declared or paid a cash dividend since we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector in february 1998 additionally our bank credit agreement contains restrictions on the payment of cash dividends we intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law could deter takeover attempts 

our board of directors may issue up to 1000000 shares of preferred stock and may determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting and conversion rights of these shares of preferred stock these determinations may be made without any further vote or action by our stockholders the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock in addition some provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and of the delaware general corporation law could also delay prevent or make more difficult a merger tender offer or proxy contest involving us 

financial outlook 

from time to time in press releases and otherwise we may publish forecasts or other forwardlooking statements regarding our results including estimated revenues or net earnings any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties and as a matter of course any number of them may prove to be incorrect further the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors including those described in this discussion many of which are beyond our control as a result we cannot be certain that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse current and potential stockholders are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions but instead are encouraged to utilize our entire publicly available mix of historical and forwardlooking information as well as other available information regarding us our products and services and the software industry when evaluating our prospective results of operations

overview 

general 

we provide integrated information management solutions and services for the public sector with a focus on local governments we develop and market a broad line of software products and services to address the information technology “it” needs of cities counties schools and other local government entities in addition we provide professional it services to our customers including software and hardware installation data conversion training and for certain customers product modifications along with continuing maintenance and support for customers using our systems we also provide subscriptionbased services such as hosted solutions as well as property appraisal outsourcing services for taxing jurisdictions 

our products generally automate three major functional areas 

 

we monitor and analyze several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance these indicators include the following 

 

 

acquisitions 

on july 16 2009 we completed the acquisition of certain assets of kpl inc dba parkerlowe  associates “parkerlowe” for 700000 in cash parkerlowe provides scanning and retrieval software and related services for land record and social services offices in local governments primarily in the north carolina area this acquisition was accounted for as a purchase of a business 

on april 3 2009 we completed the acquisition of all of the capital stock of assessment evaluation services inc “aes” aes develops integrated property appraisal solutions and specializes in applications that deal with the unique provisions of the california revenue and taxation code the purchase price was approximately 11 million in cash 

in connection with these transactions we acquired total tangible assets of approximately 480000 and assumed total liabilities of approximately 835000 including 450000 for contingent consideration for which we have paid 38000 as of december 31 2009 we recorded goodwill of approximately 13 million all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes and other intangible assets of approximately 820000 the 820000 of intangible assets is attributable to acquired software and customer relationships that will be amortized over a weighted average period of approximately 9 years our balance sheet as of december 31 2009 reflects the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition 

the operating results of these acquisitions are included in our results of operations since the date of acquisition we believe these acquisitions will complement our business by expanding our presence in certain geographic areas and adding to our customer base 

in the twelve months ended december 31 2009 we also paid approximately 11 million for certain software assets to complement our tax and appraisal solutions and our student information management solutions 

outlook 

the financial market crisis has continued to disrupt credit and equity markets worldwide broad economic conditions remain uncertain and public sector entities continue to experience pressures that are reflected in longer than normal decision processes local and state governments may face financial pressures that could in turn affect our growth rate in the first quarter of 2010 and for the calendar year while market conditions are not robust we have great stability from the foundation of recurring revenues and high customer retention our base of recurring revenues from maintenance and support and subscriptionbased services is approximately 

49 of total revenues consistent with our historical trends we expect that first quarter 2010 earnings will not reach the level achieved in the fourth quarter of 2009 and will likely be below last years first quarter earnings we also expect that in excess of 60 of our annual earnings will occur in the second half of 2010

critical accounting policies and estimates

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements the reported amounts of revenues cost of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosure of contingencies the notes to the financial statements included as part of this annual report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the application of the percentageofcompletion and proportionate performance methods of revenue recognition the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of intangible assets determination of sharebased compensation expense and valuation allowance for receivables we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements

revenue recognition  we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards codification “ asc” 605 revenue recognition and asc 985605 software revenue recognition our revenues are derived from sales of software licenses subscriptionbased services appraisal services maintenance and support and services that typically range from installation training and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs for multiple element software arrangements which do not entail the performance of services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software we generally record revenue when the delivered products or performed services result in a legally enforceable and nonrefundable claim we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized because most of our customers are governmental entities we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments in a limited number of cases we encounter a customer who is dissatisfied with some aspect of the software product or our service and we may offer a “concession” to such customer in those limited situations where we grant a concession we rarely reduce the contract arrangement fee but alternatively may perform additional services such as additional training or programming a minor feature the customer had in their prior software solution these amounts have historically been nominal in connection with our customer contracts and the adequacy of related allowances and measures of progress towards contract completion our project managers are charged with the responsibility to continually review the status of each customer on a specific contract basis also we review on at least a quarterly basis significant past due accounts receivable and the adequacy of related reserves events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments may require revision include but are not limited to deterioration of a customer’s financial condition failure to manage our customer’s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products

we use contract accounting primarily the percentageofcompletion method as discussed in asc 60535 construction — type and certain production — type contracts for those software arrangements that involve significant production modification or customization of the software or where our software services are otherwise considered essential to the functionality of the software we measure progresstocompletion primarily using labor hours incurred or value added in addition we recognize revenue using the proportionate performance method of revenue recognition for our property appraisal projects some of which can range up to five years these methods rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue billings and collections and expected contract costs as well as measures of progress toward completion we believe reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs and progress applicable to various stages of a contract can be made at times we perform additional andor noncontractual services for little to no incremental fee to satisfy customer expectations if changes occur in delivery productivity or other factors used in developing our estimates of expected costs or revenues we revise our cost and revenue estimates and any revisions are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision first become known in connection with these and certain other contracts we may perform the work prior to when the services are billable andor payable pursuant to the contract the termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the fair value of products delivered and services performed in the event of an early termination

for subscriptionbased services such as application service provider arrangements and other hosting arrangements we evaluate whether each of the elements in these arrangements represents a separate unit of accounting as defined by asc 60525 multiple element arrangements using all applicable facts and circumstances including whether i we sell or could readily sell the element unaccompanied by the other elements ii the element has standalone value to the customer iii there is objective reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item and iv there is a general right of return we consider the applicability of asc 60555121 and 122 with respect to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity’s hardware on a contractbycontract basis in hosted termbased agreements where the customer does not have the contractual right to take possession of the software hosting fees are recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the contract commencing when the customer has access to the software for professional services associated with hosting arrangements that we determine do not have standalone value to the customer we recognize the services revenue ratably over the remaining contractual period once hosting has gone live and we may begin billing for the hosting services we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 

in connection with certain of our contracts we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet date many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period management reviews unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue in addition we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue which represents billings in excess of revenue earned the majority of this liability consists of maintenance billings for which payments are made in advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the maintenance period generally one year we also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit and the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product has not been met on a periodic basis we review by customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains appropriate 

intangible assets and goodwill  our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge the cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value with the excess allocated to goodwill accordingly we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets including software customer related intangibles trade name and goodwill in addition we capitalize software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility these intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives all intangible assets with definite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 

recoverability of goodwill is generally measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its fair value generally determined by estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of april or more frequently if impairment indicators arise an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair value the fair values calculated in our impairment tests are determined using discounted cash flow models involving several assumptions these assumptions include but are not limited to anticipated operating income growth rates our longterm anticipated operating income growth rate and the discount rate our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses the assumptions that are used are based upon what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value we have identified two reporting units for impairment testing our reporting units are the same as our reportable segments and consistent with the reporting units tested for impairment in prior years assets liabilities and goodwill have been assigned to reporting units based on assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition we evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by comparing the total of the fair value of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 

recoverability of other intangible assets is generally measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows the assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved such indicators may include among others a significant decline in expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition and reductions in growth rates in addition products capabilities or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or noncompetitive any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed during the second quarter of 2009 did not result in an impairment charge during 2009 we did not identify any triggering events which would require an update to our annual impairment a 

hypothetical 10 decrease in the fair value of either of our reporting units as of december 31 2009 would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill 

sharebased compensation we have a stock option plan that provides for the grant of stock options to key employees directors and nonemployee consultants we estimate the fair value of sharebased awards on the date of grant using the blackscholes option valuation model sharebased compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures which will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from such estimates changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data we estimate stock price volatility at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock estimated option life is determined using the “simplified method” in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 110 determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates 

analysis of results of operations and other 

the following discussion compares the historical results of operations on a basis consistent with gaap for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 

2009 compared to 2008 

  revenues 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our revenues for the following years ended december 31 

 

software licenses  software license revenues consist of the following components for the following years ended december 31 

 

in 2009 we signed 74 large new contracts with average software license fees of approximately 307000 compared to 72 large new contracts signed in 2008 with average software license fees of approximately 311000 we consider contracts with a license fee component of 100000 or more to be large although a contract is signed in a particular year the year in which the revenue is recognized may be different because we recognize revenue according to our revenue recognition policy as described in note 1 in the notes to financial statements 

changes in software license revenues consist of the following components 

 

 

subscriptions subscriptionbased services revenue primarily consists of revenues derived from application service provider “asp” arrangements and other hosted service offerings software subscriptions and disaster recovery services asp and other software subscription agreements are typically for periods of three to six years and automatically renew unless either party cancels the agreement disaster recovery and miscellaneous other hosted service agreements are typically renewable annually new customers for asp and other hosted service offerings as well as existing customers who converted to our asp model provided the majority of the subscription revenue increase with the remaining increase due to slightly higher rates for disaster recovery services in june 2008 as a result of changes in its technology organization one customer terminated its asp arrangement with us and elected as provided in the asp contract to purchase the software instead this contract contributed approximately 450000 of subscription revenue in each of the first two quarters of 2008 

software services  changes in software services revenues consist of the following components 

 

maintenance  we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and third party software maintenance revenues increased 16 in 2009 compared to 2008 maintenance and support services grew 14 in 2009 excluding the impact of acquisitions this increase was due to growth in our installed customer base and slightly higher maintenance rates on most of our product lines 

appraisal services  appraisal services revenue declined 2 in 2009 compared to 2008 the appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states we substantially completed several large appraisal projects mid2009 we began several new revaluation contracts late 2009 and as a result currently expect appraisal revenues to increase slightly in 2010 

  cost of revenues and gross margins 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues and those components stated as a percentage of related revenues for the following years ended december 31 

 

the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the periods presented for the following years ended december 31 

 

software license and acquired software  amortization expense for capitalized development costs on certain software products comprised approximately 15 of our cost of software license revenues in 2009 compared to approximately 50 of our cost of software license in 2008 the remaining balance is made up of third party software costs once a product is released we begin to amortize over the estimated useful life of the product any capitalized costs associated with its development amortization expense is determined on a productbyproduct basis at an annual rate not less than straightline basis over the product’s estimated life which is generally five years development costs consist mainly of personnel costs such as salary and benefits paid to our developers and rent for related office space 

cost of acquired software includes amortization expense for software acquired through acquisitions we completed several acquisitions in the period 2007 through 2009 and these costs are being amortized over a weighted average period of approximately 5 years in late 2008 software associated with one significant acquisition completed in december 2003 became fully amortized 

in 2009 our software license gross margin percentage rose significantly compared to the prior year periods because several products became fully amortized in late 2008 as did software acquired related to a significant acquisition in december 2003 we did not capitalize any internal software development costs in 2009 or 2008 

software services maintenance and subscriptionbased services  cost of software services maintenance and subscriptions primarily consists of personnel costs related to installation of our software conversion of customer data training customer personnel and support activities and various other services such as asp and disaster recovery in 2009 the software services maintenance and subscriptions gross margin increased compared to the prior year partly because maintenance and various other services such as asp and disaster recovery costs typically grow at a slower rate than related revenues due to leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale we have increased our implementation and support staff for both the financial management and education solutions and courts and justice solutions by 51 employees since 2008 in order to expand our capacity to implement our contract backlog this increase was offset somewhat by 24 fewer employees for appraisal and tax solutions the 

software services maintenance and subscriptionbased services gross margin also benefited from slightly higher rates for certain services 

appraisal services  our appraisal gross margin increased compared to 2008 as the result of cost savings and operational efficiencies experienced on an unusually complex project a high proportion of the costs of appraisal services revenue are variable as we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects whose term of employment generally ends with the projects’ completion 

our blended gross margin for 2009 was higher than 2008 due to lower amortization expense of software development costs described above the gross margin also benefited from leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale and slightly higher rates on certain services 

  selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses consist primarily of salaries employee benefits travel sharebased compensation expense commissions and related overhead costs for administrative and sales and marketing employees as well as professional fees trade show activities advertising costs and other marketing related costs the following table sets forth a comparison of our sga expenses for the following years ended december 31 

 

the increase in sga expenses included higher sharebased compensation expense commission costs and marketing expenses marketing expenses in 2009 include costs associated with the launch of a new corporate branding initiative our sga employee count increased 4 from 2008 

  research and development expense 

research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries employee benefits and related overhead costs associated with product development and enhancements and upgrades provided to existing customers under maintenance plans the following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the following years ended december 31 

 

research and development expense consist mainly of costs associated with the microsoft dynamics ax project in addition to costs associated with other new product development efforts we have increased our research and development staff by 72 employees since 2008 in january 2007 we entered into a software development and license agreement which provided for a strategic alliance with microsoft corporation “microsoft” to jointly develop core public sector functionality for microsoft dynamics ax to address the accounting needs of public sector organizations worldwide in september 2007 tyler and microsoft signed an amendment to the software development and license agreement which grants microsoft intellectual property rights in and to certain portions of the software code provided and developed by tyler into microsoft dynamics ax products to be marketed and sold outside of the public sector in exchange for reimbursement payments to partially offset the research and development costs 

in 2009 and 2008 we offset our research and development expense by 35 million and 18 million respectively which were the amounts earned under the terms of our agreement with microsoft in september 2008 tyler and microsoft signed a statement of work under the amended software development and license agreement for which we currently expect to recognize offsets to our research and development expense by approximately 850000 each quarter through the end of 2010 in addition in october 2009 the scope of the project was further expanded that will result in additional offsets to research and development expense varying in amount from quarter to quarter with the first payment to be invoiced on august 31 2010 and invoiced quarterly through march 31 2012 for a total of approximately 62 million the actual amount and timing of future research and development costs and related reimbursements and whether they are capitalized or expensed may vary 

  noncash legal settlement related to warrants 

on june 27 2008 we settled outstanding litigation related to the warrants owned by bank of america n a “ bana” as disclosed in prior sec filings the warrants entitled bana to acquire 16 million shares of tyler common stock at an exercise price of 250 per share following courtordered mediation in july 2008 bana paid us 20 million and we issued to bana 801883 restricted shares of tyler common stock accordingly we recorded a noncash legal settlement related to warrants charge of 90 million which was not tax deductible 

  amortization of customer and trade name intangibles 

acquisition intangibles are comprised of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that is allocated to acquired software and customer and trade name intangibles the remaining excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues while amortization expense of customer and trade name intangibles is recorded as other operating expense the estimated useful lives of both customer and trade name intangibles are 5 to 25 years the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the following years ended december 31 

 

in 2009 we completed several acquisitions and purchased certain software assets to complement our tax and appraisal solutions and our student information management solutions these transactions increased amortizable customer and trade name intangibles by approximately 625000 this amount will be amortized over approximately 10 years 

estimated annual amortization expense relating to customer and trade name acquisition intangibles excluding acquired software for which the amortization expense is recorded as cost of revenues for the next five years is as follows in thousands 

 

  other 

other expense income in 2009 and 2008 includes nonusage and other fees associated with a credit agreement entered into in october 2008 other income in 2008 also included 11 million of interest income which declined due to significantly lower invested cash balances in 2009 our invested cash balances declined due to purchases of treasury stock and investments in office facilities in late 2008 and 2009 

  income tax provision 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the following years ended december 31 

 

our effective income tax rate declined compared to 2008 mainly due to a noncash legal settlement related to warrants charge of 90 million in 2008 which was not deductible in addition to the impact of the nondeductible noncash legal settlement charge in 2008 

the effective income tax rate for both years were different from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of 35 due to state income taxes nondeductible sharebased compensation expense the qualified manufacturing activities deduction and nondeductible meals and entertainment costs 

approximately 40 of our stock option awards qualify as incentive stock options “isos” for income tax purposes as such a tax benefit is not recorded at the time the compensation cost related to the options is recorded for book purposes due to the fact that an iso does not ordinarily result in a tax benefit unless there is a disqualifying disposition nonqualified stock options result in the creation of a deferred tax asset which is a temporary difference until the time that the option is exercised due to the treatment of isos for tax purposes our effective tax rate from year to year is subject to variability 

2008 compared to 2007 

  revenues 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our revenues for the following years ended december 31 

 

software licenses  software license revenues consist of the following components for the following years ended december 31 

 

changes in software license revenues consist of the following components 

 

subscriptions new asp customers and existing customers converting to asp arrangements provided the majority of the subscription revenue increase with the remaining increase due to new disaster recovery customers and slightly higher rates for disaster recovery services 

software services  changes in software services revenues consist of the following components 

 

maintenance  maintenance revenues increased 26 in 2008 compared to 2007 excluding the impact of acquisitions maintenance and support services grew 16 in 2008 this increase was due to growth in our installed customer base and slightly higher maintenance rates on most of our product lines 

appraisal services  appraisal services revenue declined 10 in 2008 compared to 2007 in late 2007 we substantially completed several projects related to the ohio revaluation cycle which occurs every six years as well as a few other large contracts appraisal revenues for the first six months of 2008 were down 23 compared to the first six months of 2007 in mid2008 we began a complete reappraisal of real property in orleans parish louisiana as a result of this contract and an overall increase in contract volume appraisal revenues for the last six months of 2008 increased 4 over the last six months of 2007 

  cost of revenues and gross margins 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues and those components stated as a percentage of related revenues for the following years ended december 31 

 

the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the periods presented for the following years ended december 31 

 

software license  in 2008 our software license gross margin percentage rose compared to the prior year mainly due to strong license fee revenue increases because approximately onehalf of our cost of software license revenues in both periods is comprised of amortization of capitalized development costs increased license fee revenues inherently result in higher gross margins 

software services maintenance and subscriptionbased services  in 2008 the software services maintenance and subscriptions gross margin increased compared to the prior year partly because maintenance and various other services such as asp and disaster recovery costs typically grow at a slower rate than related revenues due to leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale we have increased our implementation and support staff by 215 employees during 2008 in order to expand our capacity to implement our contract backlog this increase includes 102 employees related to acquisitions completed in 2008 

appraisal services  our appraisal gross margin for 2008 is higher than the prior year due to cost savings associated with a significant complex reappraisal project 

our blended gross margin in 2008 was higher than the prior year in large part due to leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale with resulting increases in gross margin for each revenue category 

  selling general and administrative expenses 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our sga expenses for the following years ended december 31 

 

excluding the impact of acquisitions our sga employee count increased 9 during 2008

  amortization of customer and trade name intangibles 

the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the following years ended december 31 

 

in 2008 we completed three acquisitions which increased amortizable customer and trade name intangibles by 123 million 

  other 

interest income was the main component of other income in both 2008 and 2007 other income in 2008 also includes nonusage and other fees associated with a credit agreement entered into in october 2008 interest income in 2008 was 11 million compared to 18 million in 2007 interest income declined due to lower invested cash balances and slightly lower interest rates our invested cash balances declined due to purchases of treasury stock and investments in office facilities in 2008 

  income tax provision 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the following years ended december 31

 

our effective income tax rate increased approximately twelve points compared to the prior year due to a noncash legal settlement related to warrants charge of 90 million which was not deductible the effective income tax rates were different from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of 35 primarily due to noncash legal settlement related to warrants charge which was not deductible as well as state income taxes nondeductible sharebased compensation expense the qualified manufacturing activities deduction and nondeductible meals and entertainment costs

business segment discussion

  enterprise software solutions 

 

in 2009 software license revenues were flat compared to 2008 growth in recurring revenues from subscriptionbased services and maintenance experienced a 14 increase excluding the impact of acquisitions and was the primary factor for the increase in overall revenue and segment operating income for the enterprise software solutions segment this increase was due to growth in our installed customer base and slightly higher maintenance rates on most of our product lines new customers for asp and other hosted service offerings as well as existing customers converting to asp arrangements and slightly higher rates for disaster recovery services also contributed to this increase the gross margin and segment operating income rose in 2009 due to lower amortization expense of software development costs the gross margin and segment operating income also benefited from leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale and slightly higher rates on certain services 

in 2008 software license revenues were 18 higher than 2007 mainly due to higher courts and justice contract volume as a result of an expanded presence in indiana and new mexico 2008 software license revenue also benefitted from student information management solutions and transportation solutions acquired in early 2008 excluding the impact of acquisitions in 2008 revenues from subscriptionbased arrangements and maintenance grew by 19 compared to 2007 primarily due to growth in our customer base our gross margin and segment operating income in 2008 was higher than 2007 in large part due to leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale and higher software license revenues 

  appraisal and tax software solutions and services 

 

in 2009 overall revenues for the appraisal and tax software solutions and services segment increased compared to 2008 mainly due to a 16 increase in subscriptionbased arrangements and maintenance due to growth in our customer base and slightly higher rates excluding the results of acquisitions subscriptionbased arrangements and maintenance increased 15 compared to 2008 this 

increase was offset slightly by 2 lower appraisal services the appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by scheduled revaluation cycles in various states we substantially completed several large appraisal projects mid2009 our appraisal gross margin and segment operating income increased compared to 2008 as the result of cost savings and operational efficiencies experienced on an unusually complex appraisal project a high proportion of the costs of appraisal services revenue are variable as we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects whose term of employment generally ends with the projects’ completion

overall appraisal and tax revenues in 2008 were flat compared to 2007 although maintenance revenues increased 8 appraisal services revenues declined 10 in late 2007 we substantially completed several appraisal projects related to the ohio revaluation cycle which occurs every six years as well as a few other large contracts the gross margin for 2008 was flat compared to 2007 due to cost savings associated with a significant complex reappraisal project which offset declines from lower contract volume 

financial condition and liquidity 

as of december 31 2009 we had cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash equivalents of 157 million and current and noncurrent investments of 20 million compared to cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash equivalents of 68 million and current and noncurrent investments of 46 million at december 31 2008 as of december 31 2009 we had no outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit totaling 73 million to secure surety bonds required by some of our customer contracts these letters of credit expire through mid2010 

the following table sets forth a summary of cash flows for the years ended december 31 

 

net cash provided by operating activities continues to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures other capital resources include cash on hand public and private issuances of debt and equity securities and bank borrowings the capital and credit markets have become more volatile and tightened as a result of adverse conditions that have caused the failure and near failure of a number of large financial services companies it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited by these or other factors notwithstanding the foregoing we believe that cash provided by operating activities cash on hand and our revolving credit agreement are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures income tax obligations and share repurchases for the foreseeable future 

in 2009 operating activities provided net cash of 429 million primarily generated from net income of 270 million noncash depreciation and amortization charges of 95 million noncash sharebased compensation expense of 50 million and a decrease in working capital of 27 million offset slightly by a 17 million decrease related to deferred income taxes working capital declined due to higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities pertaining to timing of payments on vendor invoices and income tax liabilities and an accrued liability of 18 million for a retention payment related to construction of an office building other sources of working capital were deferred revenue related to december maintenance billings and a decrease in prepaid expenses these working capital declines were offset somewhat by an increase in annual software maintenance billings as a result of growth in our installed customer base the increase in accounts receivable was offset slightly by the collection of several large customer billings one of which had been outstanding for over twelve months 

cash flows provided by operating activities in 2008 included several advance payments from customers in general changes in the balance of deferred revenue are cyclical and primarily driven by the timing of our maintenance renewal billings our renewal dates occur throughout the year but our heaviest renewal cycles occur in the second and fourth quarters 

noncurrent investments availableforsale consist of two auction rate municipal securities “ars” which are collateralized debt obligations supported by municipal and state agencies and do not include mortgagebacked securities shortterm investments 

availableforsale consists of the portion of one of these ars which was partially redeemed at par during the period january 1 2010 through february 22 2010 these ars are debt instruments with stated maturities ranging from 22 to 33 years for which the interest rate is designed to be reset through dutch auctions approximately every 30 days however due to events in the credit markets auctions for these securities have not occurred since february 2008 both of our ars have had very small partial redemptions at par in the period from july 2009 through february 2010 as of december 31 2009 we have continued to earn and collect interest on both of our ars because quoted prices in active markets are no longer available we determined the estimated fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted trinomial model the model considers the probability of three potential occurrences for each auction event through the maturity date of each ars the three potential outcomes for each auction are i successful auctionearly redemption ii failed auction and iii issuer default inputs in determining the probabilities of the potential outcomes include but are not limited to the securities’ collateral credit rating insurance issuer’s financial standing contractual restrictions on disposition and the liquidity in the market the fair value of each ars is determined by summing the present value of the probabilityweighted future principal and interest payments determined by the model since there can be no assurances that auctions for these securities will be successful in the near future we have classified our ars as noncurrent investments 

in association with this estimate of fair value we have recorded an aftertax temporary unrealized loss on our noncurrent ars of 18000 net of related tax effects of 10000 in 2009 which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our balance sheet the unrealized loss includes the impact of adjusting previously recorded unrealized losses of approximately 120000 net of related tax effects of 65000 as of december 31 2008 for several ars which were subsequently redeemed for 25 million at par during 2009 

we consider the impairment in our ars as temporary because we do not have the intent to sell nor is it morelikelythannot that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their cost basis we believe that this temporary decline in fair value is due entirely to liquidity issues because the underlying assets of these securities are supported by municipal and state agencies and do not include mortgagebacked securities have redemption features which call for redemption at 100 of par value and have a current credit rating of a or aaa the ratings on the ars take into account credit support through insurance policies guaranteeing each of the bonds’ payment of principal and accrued interest if it becomes necessary in addition both ars have had very small partial redemptions at par in the period july 2009 through february 2010 based on our cash and cash equivalents balance of 157 million and expected operating cash flows we do not believe a lack of liquidity associated with our ars will adversely affect our ability to conduct business and believe we have the ability to hold the securities throughout the currently estimated recovery period we will continue to evaluate any changes in the market value of our ars and in the future depending upon existing market conditions we may be required to record an otherthantemporary decline in market value 

at december 31 2009 our days sales outstanding “dsos” were 98 days compared to dsos of 99 days at december 31 2008 dsos are calculated based on accounts receivable excluding longterm receivables but including unbilled receivables divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by 360 days 

investing activities used cash of 137 million in 2009 compared to 96 million in 2008 in connection with plans to consolidate our workforce and support planned longterm growth we paid 94 million for construction of an office building and expect to pay the final retainage of 18 million by mid2010 we also liquidated 25 million of investments in ars for cash at par in 2009 we completed the acquisition of all of the capital stock of assessment evaluation services inc for 11 million in cash paid 700000 in cash for certain assets of kpl inc dba parkerlowe  associates and acquired various software assets for 11 million in cash capital expenditures and acquisitions were funded from cash generated from operations 

in 2008 we liquidated 364 million of ars investments for cash at par and we completed the acquisitions of school information systems inc versatrans solutions inc and certain assets of olympia computing company inc dba schoolmaster to expand our presence in the education market the combined purchase price excluding cash acquired and including transaction costs was approximately 239 million in cash and approximately 196000 shares of tyler common stock valued at 29 million we paid 33 million which included 21 million for land for an office development we also paid 127 million for an office building land and a related tenant lease in yarmouth maine 

cash used in financing activities was primarily comprised of purchases of treasury shares net of proceeds from stock option exercises payments on our revolving credit line and contributions from our employee stock purchase plan during 2009 we purchased 12 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 170 million we also paid 13 million for common stock repurchases accrued as of december 31 2008 

the repurchase program which was approved by our board of directors was announced in october 2002 and was amended in april and july 2003 october 2004 october 2005 may 2007 may 2008 october 2008 and may 2009 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 20 million shares on may 14 2009 as of december 31 2009 we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to 23 million additional shares of our common stock our share repurchase program allows us to repurchase shares at our discretion and market conditions influence the timing of the buybacks and the number of shares repurchased these share repurchases are funded using our existing cash balances as well as borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and may occur through open market purchase and transactions structured through investment banking institutions privately negotiated transactions andor other mechanisms there is no expiration date specified for the authorization and we intend to repurchase stock under the plan from time to time our bank credit agreement contains restrictions on the amount of common stock we may purchase 

during 2008 we purchased 43 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 590 million 

in 2009 we issued 425000 shares of common stock and received 23 million in aggregate proceeds upon exercise of stock options in 2008 we received 18 million from the exercise of options to purchase approximately 379000 shares of our common stock under our employee stock option plan and during 2007 we received 36 million from the exercise of options to purchase approximately 878000 shares of our common stock under our employee stock option plan in 2009 we received 15 million from contributions to the tyler technologies inc employee stock purchase plan “espp” in both 2008 and 2007 we received 12 million from contributions to the espp 

subsequent to december 31 2009 and through february 22 2010 we purchased approximately 59000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate cash purchase price of 11 million 

in october 2008 we entered into a revolving bank credit agreement the “credit facility” and a related pledge and security agreement which originally matured october 19 2009 we amended and extended the related pledge and security agreement in october 2009 the credit facility matures october 18 2010 and provides for total borrowings of up to 250 million and a 100 million letter of credit facility which can either be cash collateralized or issued using availability under the credit facility the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our property the credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial conditions and prohibits us from making certain investments advances cash dividends or loans restricts the amount of our common stock we may purchase and limits incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens as of december 31 2009 we were in compliance with those covenants we expect borrowings to fund discretionary purchases of our common stock or fund acquisitions 

as of december 31 2009 we had no outstanding borrowings and unused available borrowing capacity of 237 million under the credit facility in addition as of december 31 2009 our bank had issued outstanding letters of credit totaling 73 million to secure surety bonds required by some of our customer contracts these letters of credit have been collateralized by restricted cash balances of 60 million and 13 million of our available borrowing capacity and expire through mid2010 

we paid income taxes net of refunds received of 181 million in 2009 157 million in 2008 and 87 million in 2007 

in the first quarter of 2010 we acquired all the assets of wiznet inc “wiznet” for a cash purchase price of 95 million wiznet provides electronic document filing solutions for courts and law offices throughout the united states and is currently integrated with our primary courts and justice solution we have not finalized the allocation of the purchase price 

excluding acquisitions and final retainage payment of 18 million for an office building we anticipate that 2010 capital spending will be between 37 million and 42 million we expect the majority of our capital spending in 2010 will consist of computer equipment and software for infrastructure expansion we currently do not expect to capitalize significant amounts related to software development in 2010 but the actual amount and timing of those costs and whether they are capitalized or expensed may result in additional capitalized software development capital spending in 2010 is expected to be funded from existing cash balances and cash flows from operations 

from time to time we engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates in order to pursue such opportunities which could require significant commitments of capital we may be required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive securities in the future no assurance can be given as to our future acquisition opportunities and how such opportunities will be financed 

we lease office facilities as well as transportation computer and other equipment used in our operations under noncancelable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through 2014 most leases contain renewal options and some contain purchase 

options following are the future obligations under noncancelable leases at december 31 2009 in thousands 

 

as of december 31 2009 we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements guarantees to third parties or material purchase commitments except for the operating lease commitments listed above 

capitalization 

at december 31 2009 our capitalization consisted of 1344 million of shareholders’ equity 

new accounting pronouncements 

in september 2009 the financial accounting standards board issued asu 200913 multiple element arrangements asu 200913 addresses the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting asu 200913 also modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across separately identified deliverables and establishes definitions for determining fair value of elements in an arrangement this new update is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june 15 2010 early adoption is allowed the new standard may impact our application service provider arrangements to recognize revenues such as installation and data conversion which are generally provided at the beginning of the arrangement as incurred instead of ratably over the life of the initial hosting term the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operation 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial market prices and interest rates our investments availableforsale consist of auction rate municipal securities “ars” which are collateralized debt obligations supported by municipal and state agencies and do not include mortgagebacked securities 

noncurrent investments availableforsale consist of two ars with stated maturities ranging from 22 to 33 years for which the interest rate is designed to be reset through dutch auctions approximately every 30 days which would have qualified as level 1 under asc 820 fair value measurements however due to events in the credit markets auctions for these securities have not occurred since february 2008 therefore quoted prices in active markets are no longer available and we determined the estimated fair values of these securities as of december 31 2009 utilizing a discounted trinomial model 

in association with this estimate of fair value we have recorded an aftertax temporary unrealized loss on our noncurrent ars of 18000 net of related tax effects of 10000 in 2009 which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our balance sheet the unrealized loss includes the impact of adjusting previously recorded unrealized losses of approximately 120000 net of related tax effects of 65000 as of december 31 2008 for several ars which were subsequently redeemed for 25 million at par during 2009 we consider the impairment in our ars as temporary because we do not have the intent to sell nor is it morelikelythannot that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their cost basis we believe that this temporary decline in fair value is due entirely to liquidity issues because the underlying assets of these securities are supported by municipal and state agencies and do not include mortgagebacked securities have redemption features which call for redemption at 100 of par value and have a current credit rating of a or aaa the ratings on the ars take into account credit support through insurance policies guaranteeing each of the bonds’ payment of principal and accrued interest if it becomes necessary in addition both ars have had very small partial redemptions at par in the period july 2009 through february 2010 based on our cash and cash equivalents balance of 157 million and expected operating cash flows we do not believe a lack of liquidity associated with our ars will adversely affect our ability to conduct business and believe we have the ability to hold the securities throughout the currently estimated recovery period we will continue to evaluate any changes in the market value of our ars and in the future depending upon existing market conditions we may be required to record an otherthantemporary decline in market value

tyler was founded in 1966 prior to 1998 we operated as a diversified industrial conglomerate with operations in various industrial retail and distribution businesses all of which have been divested in 1997 we embarked on a multiphase growth plan focused on serving the specialized information management needs of local governments nationwide in 1998 and 1999 we entered the local government it market through a series of strategic acquisitions of companies in the local government it market 

market overview 

the state and local government market is one of the largest and most decentralized it markets in the country consisting of all 50 states approximately 3000 counties 36000 cities and towns and 14200 school districts this market is also comprised of approximately 35000 special districts and other agencies each with specialized delegated responsibilities and unique information management requirements 

traditionally local government bodies and agencies performed statemandated duties including property assessment record keeping road maintenance law enforcement administration of election and judicial functions and the provision of welfare assistance today a host of emerging and urgent issues are confronting local governments each of which demands a service response these areas include criminal justice and corrections administration and finance public safety health and human services and public works transfers of responsibility from the federal and state governments to county and municipal governments and agencies in these and other areas also place additional service and financial requirements on these local government units in addition constituents of local governments are increasingly demanding improved service and better access to information from public entities as a result local governments recognize the increasing value of information management systems and services to among other things improve revenue collection provide increased access to information and streamline delivery of services to their constituents local government bodies are now recognizing that “egovernment” is an additional responsibility for community development from integrated tax systems to integrated civil and criminal justice information systems many counties and cities have benefited significantly from the implementation of jurisdictionwide systems that allow different agencies or government offices to share data and provide a more comprehensive approach to information management many city and county governmental agencies also have unique individual information management requirements which must be tailored to the specific functions of each particular office 

many local governments also have difficulties attracting and retaining the staff necessary to support their it functions as a result they seek to establish longterm relationships with reliable providers of high quality it products and services such as tyler 

although local governments generally face budgetary constraints in their operations their primary revenue sources are usually property taxes and to a lesser extent utility billings which tend to be relatively stable in addition the acquisition of new technology typically enables local governments to operate more efficiently and often provides a measurable return on investment that justifies the purchase of software and related services 

gartner estimates that state and local government it spending will grow from 512 billion in 2009 to 595 billion in 2012 with local government accounting for 261 billion of it spending in 2009 and 303 billion in 2012 the external services and software segments of the market where our business is primarily focused is expected to expand from 138 billion in 2009 to 169 billion in 2012 

products and services 

we provide a comprehensive and flexible suite of products and services that address the information technology needs of cities counties schools and other local government entities we derive our revenues from five primary sources

historically we have had a greater proportion of our annual revenues in the second half of our fiscal year due to governmental budget and spending cycles and the timing of system implementations for customers desiring to “go live” at the beginning of the calendar year

software services 

we provide a variety of professional it services to customers who utilize our software products virtually all of our customers contract with us for installation training and data conversion services in connection with their purchase of tyler’s software solutions the complete implementation process for a typical system includes planning design data conversion setup and testing at the culmination of the implementation process an installation team travels to the customer’s facility to ensure the smooth transfer of data to the new system installation fees are charged separately to customers on either a fixedfee or hourly charge basis depending on the contract with full passthrough to customers of travel and other outofpocket expenses

appraisal services 

we are the nation’s largest provider of property appraisal outsourcing services for local government taxing authorities these services include 

 

local government taxing authorities normally reappraise properties from time to time to update values for tax assessment purposes and to maintain equity in the taxing process in some jurisdictions reassessment cycles are mandated by law in others they are discretionary while some taxing jurisdictions perform reappraisals inhouse many local governments outsource this function because of its cyclical nature and because of the specialized knowledge and expertise requirements associated with it our appraisal services business unit has been in this business since 1938 

in some instances we also sell property tax andor appraisal software products in connection with appraisal outsourcing projects while other customers may only engage us to provide appraisal services appraisal outsourcing services are somewhat seasonal in nature to the extent that winter weather conditions reduce the productivity of data collection activities in connection with those projects 

strategy 

our objective is to grow our revenue and earnings internally supplemented by focused strategic acquisitions the key components of our business strategy are to 

 

 

 

 

sales marketing and customers 

we market our products and services through direct sales and marketing personnel located throughout the united states other inhouse sales staff focuses on addon sales professional services and support 

sales of new systems are typically generated from referrals from other government offices or departments within a county or municipality referrals from other local governments relationships established between sales representatives and county or local officials contacts at trade shows direct mailings and direct contact from prospects already familiar with us we are active in numerous national state county and local government associations and participate in annual meetings trade shows and educational events 

customers consist primarily of county and municipal agencies school districts and other local government offices in counties customers include the auditor treasurer tax assessorcollector county clerk district clerk county and district court judges probation officers sheriff and county appraiser at municipal government sites customers include directors from various departments including administration finance utilities public works code enforcement personnel purchasing taxation municipal court and police contracts for software products and services are generally implemented over periods of three months to one year with annually renewing maintenance and support update agreements thereafter although either the customer or we can terminate these agreements historically almost all support and maintenance agreements are automatically renewed annually contracts for appraisal outsourcing services are generally one to three years in duration during 2008 approximately 41 of our revenue was attributable to ongoing support and maintenance agreements 

competition 

we compete with numerous local regional and national firms that provide or offer some or many of the same solutions and services that we provide most of these competitors are smaller companies that may be able to offer less expensive solutions than ours many of these firms operate within a specific geographic area andor in a narrow product or service niche we also compete with national firms some of which have greater financial and technical resources than we do including oracle corporation lawson software inc sap ag affiliated computer services inc sungard data systems inc new world systems constellation software inc and manatron inc in addition we sometimes compete with consulting and systems integration firms such as bearingpoint inc which develop custom systems primarily for larger governments we also occasionally compete with central internal information service departments of local governments which require us to persuade the enduser department to discontinue service by its own personnel and outsource the service to us we compete on a variety of factors including price service name recognition reputation technological capabilities and the ability to modify existing products and services to accommodate the individual requirements of the customer our ability to offer an integrated system of applications for several offices or departments is often a competitive strength local governmental units often are required to seek competitive proposals through a request for proposal process 

suppliers 

substantially all of the computers peripherals printers scanners operating system software office automation software and other equipment necessary for the implementation and provision of our software systems and services are presently available from several thirdparty sources hardware is purchased on original equipment manufacturer or distributor terms at discounts from retail we have not experienced any significant supply problems 

backlog 

at december 31 2008 our estimated revenue backlog was approximately 2434 million compared to 2501 million at december 31 2007 the backlog represents signed contracts under which the products have not been delivered or the services have not been performed as of yearend approximately 1813 million of the backlog is expected to be recognized during 2009 

intellectual property proprietary rights and licenses 

we regard certain features of our internal operations software and documentation as confidential and proprietary and rely on a combination of contractual restrictions trade secret laws and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property we generally do not rely on patents we believe that due to the rapid rate of technological change in the computer software industry trade secrets and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as knowledge ability and experience of our employees frequent product enhancements and timeliness and quality of support services we typically license our software products under nonexclusive license agreements which are generally nontransferable and have a perpetual term 

employees 

at december 31 2008 we had 1940 employees appraisal outsourcing projects are cyclical in nature and can be widely dispersed geographically we often hire temporary employees to assist in these projects whose term of employment generally ends with the project’s completion none of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to collective bargaining agreements we consider our relations with our employees to be positive

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk investors evaluating our company should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this annual report any of the following factors could materially harm our business operating results and financial condition additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business operating results and financial condition this section should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report we may make forwardlooking statements from time to time both written and oral we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forwardlooking statements our actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forwardlooking statements due to a number of factors including those set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report 

declining general economic conditions and uncertainties in the global credit crisis and equity markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the financial market crisis has continued to disrupt credit and equity markets worldwide and has led to continued weakening in the global economic environment during the first quarter of 2009 local and state governments may face financial pressures that could in turn affect our growth rate in 2009 we cannot assure you local and state spending levels will be unaffected by the global credit crisis and if budget shortfalls occur they may negatively impact local and state information technology spending and could have a material adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition 

a decline in information technology spending may result in a decrease in our revenues or lower our growth rate 

a decline in the demand for information technology among our current and prospective customers may result in decreased revenues or a lower growth rate for us because our sales depend in part on our customers’ level of funding for new or additional information technology systems and services moreover demand for our solutions may be reduced by a decline in overall demand for computer software and services accordingly we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase or maintain our revenues 

our products are complex and we run the risk of errors or defects with new product introductions or enhancements 

software products as complex as those developed by us may contain errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released although we have not experienced material adverse effects resulting from any such defects or errors to date we cannot assure you that material defects and errors will not be found after commencement of product shipments any such defects could result in loss of revenues or delay market acceptance 

our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims it is possible however that we may not always be able to negotiate such provisions in our contracts with customers or that the limitation of liability provisions contained in our license agreements may not be effective as a result of existing or future federal state or local laws ordinances or judicial decisions although we maintain errors and omissions and general liability insurance and we try to structure our contracts to include limitations on liability we cannot assure you that a successful claim could not be made or would not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may experience fluctuations in quarterly revenue that could adversely impact our stock price and our operating results 

our actual revenues in a quarter could fall below expectations which could lead to a decline in our stock price our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter revenues from license fees in any quarter depend substantially upon our contracting activity and our ability to recognize revenues in that quarter in accordance with our revenue recognition policies our quarterly revenue may fluctuate and may be difficult to forecast for a variety of reasons including the following 

 

fluctuation in our quarterly revenues may adversely affect our operating results in each fiscal quarter our expense levels operating costs and hiring plans are based to some extent on projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed if our actual revenues fall below expectations we could experience a reduction in operating results 

as with other software vendors we may be required to delay revenue recognition into future periods which could adversely impact our operating results 

we have in the past had to and in the future may have to defer revenue recognition for license fees due to several factors including whether 

 

because of the factors listed above and other specific requirements under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states for software revenue recognition we must have very precise terms in our license agreements in order to recognize revenue when we initially deliver and install software or perform services negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions can extend the sales cycle and sometimes we do not obtain terms and conditions that permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery or even as work on the project is completed 

compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 new securities and exchange commission regulations and new york stock exchange rules are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours the costs required to comply with such evolving laws are difficult to predict to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards this investment may result in an unforeseen increase in general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities which may harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins and adversely affect our operating results 

we realize lower margins on software and appraisal service revenues than on license revenue the majority of our contracts include both software licenses and professional services therefore an increase in the percentage of software service and appraisal service revenue compared to license revenue could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and could adversely affect operating results 

selling products and services into the public sector poses unique challenges 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of software and services to state county and city governments other municipal agencies and other public entities we expect that sales to public sector customers will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues in the future we face many risks and challenges associated with contracting with governmental entities including 

 

each of these risks is outside our control if we fail to adequately adapt to these risks and uncertainties our financial performance could be adversely affected 

the open bidding process for governmental contracts creates uncertainty in predicting future contract awards 

many governmental agencies purchase products and services through an open bidding process generally a governmental entity will publish an established list of requirements requesting potential vendors to propose solutions for the established requirements to respond successfully to these requests for proposals we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract the time required to establish operations for the proposed client and the likely terms of any other third party proposals submitted we cannot guarantee that we will win any bids in the future through the request for proposal process or that any winning bids will ultimately result in contracts on favorable terms our failure to secure contracts through the open bidding process or to secure such contracts on favorable terms may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

fixed price contracts may affect our profits 

some of our present contracts are on a fixedpriced basis which can lead to various risks including 

 

if we do not adequately assess these and other risks we may be subject to cost overruns and penalties which may harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

we face significant competition from other vendors and potential new entrants into our markets 

we believe we are a leading provider of integrated solutions for the public sector however we face competition from a variety of software vendors that offer products and services similar to those offered by us as well as from companies offering to develop custom software we compete on the basis of a number of factors including 

 

we believe the market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors that vary in size primary computer platforms and overall product scope our competitors include consulting firms publicly held companies that focus on selected segments of the public sector market and a significant number of smaller privately held companies certain competitors have greater technical marketing and financial resources than we do we cannot assure you that such competitors will not develop products or offer services that are superior to our products or services or that achieve greater market acceptance 

we also compete with internal centralized information service departments of governmental entities which require us to persuade the enduser to stop the internal service and outsource to us in addition our customers may elect in the future to provide information management services internally through new or existing departments which could reduce the market for our services 

we could face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the public sector software application market and new products and technologies are introduced increased competition could result in pricing pressure fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share in addition current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with thirdparties thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share further competitive pressures could require us to reduce the price of our software licenses and related services we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the failure to do so would have material adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition 

we must respond to rapid technological changes to be competitive 

the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards in computer hardware and software technology changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result our future success will depend in part upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products and develop and introduce in a timely manner or acquire new products that keep pace with technological developments satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance we cannot assure you that we will successfully 

identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and costeffective manner further we cannot assure you that the products capabilities or technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive if we are unable to develop or acquire on a timely and costeffective basis new software products or enhancements to existing products or if such new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance our business operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

our failure to properly manage growth could adversely affect our business 

we have expanded our operations since february 1998 when we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector we intend to continue expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities this growth places a significant demand on management and operational resources in order to manage growth effectively we must implement and improve our operational systems procedures and controls on a timely basis we must also identify hire train and manage key managerial and technical personnel if we fail to implement these systems or employ and retain such qualified personnel our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to hire integrate and retain qualified personnel 

our continued success will depend upon the availability and performance of our key management sales marketing customer support and product development personnel the loss of key management or technical personnel could adversely affect us we believe that our continued success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract integrate and retain such personnel we have at times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel competition for qualified software development sales and other personnel is intense and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

we may experience difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy 

in addition a significant portion of our growth has resulted from strategic acquisitions in new product and geographic markets although our future focus will be on internal growth we will continue to identify and pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances with suitable candidates our future success will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate future acquisitions and other strategic alliances into our operations acquisitions may involve a number of special risks including diversion of management’s attention failure to retain key acquired personnel unanticipated events or circumstances legal liabilities and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we conduct due diligence reviews of potential acquisition candidates we may not identify all material liabilities or risks related to acquisition candidates there can be no assurance that any such strategic acquisitions or alliances will be accomplished on favorable terms or will result in profitable operations 

we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights 

many of our product and service offerings incorporate proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of contracts copyrights and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology we cannot be certain that we have taken all appropriate steps to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property in addition there has been significant litigation in the united states in recent years involving intellectual property rights we are not currently involved in any material intellectual property litigation we may however be a party to intellectual property litigation in the future to protect our proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights further we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us in the future with respect to current or future products any claims or litigation with or without merit could be timeconsuming and result in costly litigation and diversion of management’s attention further any claims and litigation could cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements such royalty or licensing arrangements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all thus litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations regardless of the final outcome of such litigation 

changes in the insurance markets may affect our ability to win some contract awards and may lead to increased expenses 

some of our customers primarily those for our property appraisal services require that we secure performance bonds before they will select us as their vendor the number of qualified highrated insurance companies that offer performance bonds has decreased in recent years while the costs associated with securing these bonds has increased dramatically in addition we are generally required to issue a letter of credit as security for the issuance of a performance bond we periodically enter into longterm borrowing agreements and each letter of credit we issue without corresponding cash collateral may reduce our borrowing capacity under the borrowing agreement we cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure such performance bonds in the future on terms that are favorable to us if at all our inability to obtain performance bonds on favorable terms or at all could impact our future ability to win some contract awards particularly large property appraisal services contracts which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

recent volatility in the stock markets increasing shareholder litigation the adoption of expansive legislation that redefines corporate controls in particular legislation adopted to prevent future corporate and accounting scandals as well as other factors have recently led to significant increases in premiums for directors’ and officers’ liability insurance the number of insurers offering directors and officers insurance at competitive rates has also decreased in recent years volatility of the insurance market may result in future increases in our general and administrative expenses which may adversely affect future operating results 

our stock price may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and may be significantly affected by many different factors some examples of factors that can have a significant impact on our stock price include 

 

in addition the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for the common stock of technology companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company we cannot assure you that similar litigation will not occur in the future with respect to us such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition 

historically we have not paid dividends on our common stock 

we have not declared or paid a cash dividend since we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector in february 1998 additionally our bank credit agreement contains restrictions on the payment of cash dividends we intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law could deter takeover attempts 

our board of directors may issue up to 1000000 shares of preferred stock and may determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting and conversion rights of these shares of preferred stock these determinations may be made without any further vote or action by our stockholders the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock in addition some provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and of the delaware general corporation law could also delay prevent or make more difficult a merger tender offer or proxy contest involving us 

financial outlook 

from time to time in press releases and otherwise we may publish forecasts or other forwardlooking statements regarding our results including estimated revenues or net earnings any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties and as a matter of course any number of them may prove to be incorrect further the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors including those described in this discussion many of which are beyond our control as a result we cannot be certain that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse current and potential stockholders are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions but instead are encouraged to utilize our entire publicly available mix of historical and forwardlooking information as well as other available information regarding us our products and services and the software industry when evaluating our prospective results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

on november 3 2008 a putative collective action complaint was filed against us in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas on behalf of current and former “customer support analysts” “client liaisons” “engineers” “trainers” and “education services specialists” the petition alleges that we misclassified these groups of employees as “exempt” rather than “nonexempt” under the fair labor standards act therefore the petition alleges that we failed to properly pay overtime wages the suit was initiated by six former employees working out of our longview texas office and seeks to recover damages in the form of lost overtime pay since october 31 2005 liquidated damages equal to the amount of lost overtime pay interest costs and attorneys’ fees we intend to vigorously defend the action given the preliminary nature of the alleged claims and the inherent unpredictability of litigation we cannot at this time estimate the possible outcome of any such action 

on june 27 2008 we settled outstanding litigation related to two stock purchase warrants the “warrants” owned by bank of america n a “bana” as disclosed in prior sec filings the warrants entitled bana to acquire 16 million shares of tyler common stock at an exercise price of 250 per share the warrants expired on september 10 2007 prior to their expiration bana attempted to exercise the warrants however the parties disputed whether or not bana’s exercise was effective we filed suit for declaratory judgment seeking a court’s determination on the matter and bana asserted numerous counterclaims against us including breach of contract and misrepresentation 

following courtordered mediation in july 2008 bana paid us 20 million and we issued to bana 801883 restricted shares of tyler common stock accordingly as a result of the settlement we recorded a noncash legal settlement related to warrants charge of 90 million which is not tax deductible in 2008

overview 

general 

we provide integrated information management solutions and services for local governments we develop and market a broad line of software products and services to address the information technology “it” needs of cities counties schools and other local government entities in addition we provide professional it services to our customers including software and hardware installation data conversion training and for certain customers product modifications along with continuing maintenance and support for customers using our systems we also provide subscriptionbased services such as application service provider arrangements and other hosting services as well as property appraisal outsourcing services for taxing jurisdictions 

our products are generally grouped into four major areas 

 

we monitor and analyze several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance these indicators include the following 

 

 

acquisitions 

we completed the acquisitions of school information systems inc versatrans solutions inc and certain assets of olympia computing company inc dba schoolmaster to expand our presence in the education market the combined purchase price excluding cash acquired and including transaction costs was approximately 239 million in cash and approximately 196000 shares of tyler common stock valued at 29 million in connection with these transactions we acquired total tangible assets of approximately 35 million and assumed total liabilities of approximately 82 million 

outlook 

the financial market crisis has continued to disrupt credit and equity markets worldwide and has led to continued weakening in the global economic environment during the first quarter of 2009 local and state governments may face financial pressures that could in turn affect our growth rate in the first quarter of 2009 and for the calendar year consistent with our historical trends we expect that first quarter 2009 earnings will not reach the level achieved in the fourth quarter of 2008 however we currently do not anticipate a material negative impact for the 2009 first quarter due to the current economic downturn 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements the reported amounts of revenues cost of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the notes to the financial statements included as part of this annual report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the application of the percentageofcompletion and proportionate performance methods of revenue recognition the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of intangible assets determination of sharebased compensation expense and valuation allowance for receivables we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of statement of position “sop” 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended by sop 984 and sop 989 as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants and in accordance with the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” we recognize revenue on our appraisal services contracts using the proportionate performance method of accounting with considerations for the provisions of emerging issue task force “eitf” no 0021 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” our revenues are derived from sales of software licenses subscription 

based services appraisal services maintenance and support and services that typically range from installation training and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs for multiple element software arrangements which do not entail the performance of services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software we generally record revenue when the delivered products or performed services result in a legally enforceable and nonrefundable claim we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized because most of our customers are governmental entities we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments in a limited number of cases we encounter a customer who is dissatisfied with some aspect of the software product or our service and we may offer a “concession” to such customer in those limited situations where we grant a concession we rarely reduce the contract arrangement fee but alternatively may perform additional services such as additional training or programming a minor feature the customer had in their prior software solution these amounts have historically been considered nominal in connection with our customer contracts and the adequacy of related allowances and measures of progress towards contract completion our project managers are charged with the responsibility to continually review the status of each customer on a specific contract basis also we review on at least a quarterly basis significant past due accounts receivable and the adequacy of related reserves events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments may require revision include but are not limited to deterioration of a customer’s financial condition failure to manage our customer’s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products 

for those software arrangements that involve significant production modification or customization of the software which is considered essential to its functionality and for substantially all property appraisal outsourcing projects we recognize revenue and profit as the work progresses using the percentageofcompletion method and the proportionate performance method of revenue recognition these methods rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue billings and collections and expected contract costs as well as measures of progress toward completion we believe reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs and progress applicable to various stages of a contract can be made at times we perform additional andor noncontractual services for little to no incremental fee to satisfy customer expectations if changes occur in delivery productivity or other factors used in developing our estimates of expected costs or revenues we revise our cost and revenue estimates and any revisions are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision first become known 

we use contract accounting primarily the percentageofcompletion method and apply the provisions of sop no 811 “accounting for performance of construction — type and certain production — type contracts” for those software arrangements that involve significant production modification or customization of the software or where our software services are otherwise considered essential to the functionality of the software in addition we recognize revenue using the proportionate performance method of revenue recognition for our property appraisal projects some of which can range up to three years in connection with these and certain other contracts we may perform the work prior to when the services are billable andor payable pursuant to the contract the termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the fair value of products delivered and services performed in the event of an early termination 

for subscriptionbased services such as application service provider arrangements and other hosting arrangements we evaluate whether each of the elements in these arrangements represents a separate unit of accounting as defined by eitf 0021 using all applicable facts and circumstances including whether i we sell or could readily sell the element unaccompanied by the other elements ii the element has standalone value to the customer iii there is objective reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item and iv there is a general right of return we consider the applicability of eitf no 0003 “application of sop 972 to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity’s hardware” on a contractbycontract basis in hosted termbased agreements where the customer does not have the contractual right to take possession of the software hosting fees are recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the contract commencing when the customer has access to the software for professional services associated with hosting arrangements that we determine do not have standalone value to the customer we recognize the services revenue ratably over the remaining contractual period once hosting has gone live and we may begin billing for the hosting services we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 

in connection with certain of our contracts we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet date many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period management reviews unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue in addition we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue which represents billings in excess of revenue earned the majority of this liability consists of maintenance billings for which payments are made in 

advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the maintenance period generally one year we also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit and the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product has not been met on a periodic basis we review by customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains appropriate 

intangible assets and goodwill  our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge the cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value with the excess allocated to goodwill accordingly we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets including software customer related intangibles trade name and goodwill in addition we capitalize software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility these intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives all intangible assets with definite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 

recoverability of goodwill is generally measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its fair value generally determined by estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of april or more frequently if impairment indicators arise an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair value the fair values calculated in our impairment tests are determined using discounted cash flow models involving several assumptions these assumptions include but are not limited to anticipated operating income growth rates our longterm anticipated operating income growth rate and the discount rate the assumptions that are used are based upon what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value we have identified two reporting units for impairment testing the appraisal services and appraisal software standalone business unit qualified as a reporting unit since it is one level below an operating segment discrete financial information exists for the business unit and the executive management group directly reviews this business unit the other software business units were aggregated into the other single reporting unit the appraisal services and appraisal software standalone business unit is organized in such a manner that both of its revenue sources are tightly integrated with each other and discrete financial information at the operating profit level does not exist for this business unit’s respective revenue sources recoverability of other intangible assets is generally measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows 

the assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include but are not limited to a significant decrease in the market value of the business or asset acquired a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the business or asset acquired is used or a significant adverse change in the business climate in addition products capabilities or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or noncompetitive 

sharebased compensation we have a stock option plan that provides for the grant of stock options to key employees directors and nonemployee consultants we estimate the fair value of sharebased awards on the date of grant using the blackscholes option valuation model sharebased compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures which will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from such estimates changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data we estimate stock price volatility at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock estimated option life is determined using the “simplified method” in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 110 determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates 

analysis of results of operations and other 

the following discussion compares the historical results of operations on a basis consistent with gaap for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

2008 compared to 2007 

  revenues 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our revenues for the following years ended december 31 

 

software licenses  software license revenues consist of the following components for the following years ended december 31 

 

in 2008 we signed 72 material new contracts with average software license fees of approximately 311000 compared to 86 material new contracts signed in 2007 with average software license fees of approximately 434000 we consider contracts with a license fee component of 100000 or more to be material average software license fees in 2007 included the impact of one courts and justice statewide contract that contained an unusually large amount of software license fees although a contract is signed in a particular year the year in which the revenue is recognized may be different because we recognize revenue according to our revenue recognition policy as described in note 1 in the notes to financial statements 

changes in software license revenues consist of the following components 

 

subscriptions subscriptionbased services revenue primarily consists of revenues derived from asp arrangements and other hosted service offerings software subscriptions and disaster recovery services asp and other software subscriptions agreements are typically for periods of three to six years and automatically renew unless either party cancels the agreement disaster recovery 

and miscellaneous other hosted service agreements are typically renewable annually new asp customers and existing customers converting to asp arrangements provided the majority of the subscription revenue increase with the remaining increase due to new disaster recovery customers and slightly higher rates for disaster recovery services 

software services  changes in software services revenues consist of the following components 

 

maintenance  we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and third party software maintenance revenues increased 26 in 2008 compared to 2007 maintenance and support services grew 16 in 2008 excluding the impact of acquisitions completed in the prior twelve months this increase was due to growth in our installed customer base and slightly higher maintenance rates on most of our product lines 

appraisal services  appraisal services revenue declined 10 in 2008 compared to 2007 the appraisal services business is driven in part by revaluation cycles in various states in late 2007 we substantially completed several projects related to the ohio revaluation cycle which occurs every six years as well as a few other large contracts appraisal revenues for the first six months of 2008 were down 23 compared to the first six months of 2007 in mid2008 we began a complete reappraisal of real property in orleans parish louisiana this contract is valued at approximately 120 million and consists of two separate phases expected to be complete by late 2010 as a result of this contract and an overall increase in contract volume appraisal revenues for the last six months of 2008 increased 4 over the last six months of 2007 in 2009 we expect appraisal revenue to increase over 2008 by a modest amount 

  cost of revenues and gross margins 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues and those components stated as a percentage of related revenues for the following years ended december 31 

 

the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the periods presented for the following years ended december 31 

 

software license  approximately onehalf of our cost of software license revenues is amortization expense for capitalized development costs on certain software products with third party software costs making up the balance once a product is released we begin to amortize over the estimated useful life of the product any capitalized costs associated with its development amortization expense is determined on a productbyproduct basis at an annual rate not less than straightline basis over the product’s estimated life which is generally five years development costs consist mainly of personnel costs such as salary and benefits paid to our developers and rent for related office space 

in 2008 our software license gross margin percentage rose compared to the prior year mainly due to strong license fee revenue increases because approximately onehalf of our cost of software license revenues is comprised of amortization of capitalized development costs increased license fee revenues inherently result in higher gross margins 

software services maintenance and subscriptionbased services  cost of software services maintenance and subscriptions primarily consists of personnel costs related to installation of our software conversion of customer data training customer personnel and support activities and various other services such as asp and disaster recovery in 2008 the software services maintenance and subscriptions gross margin increased compared to the prior year partly because maintenance and various other services such as asp and disaster recovery costs typically grow at a slower rate than related revenues due to leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale we have increased our implementation and support staff by 215 fulltime equivalent employees since 2007 in order to expand our capacity to implement our contract backlog this increase includes 102 fulltime equivalent employees related to acquisitions completed since 2007 

appraisal services  a high proportion of the costs of appraisal services revenue are variable as we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects whose term of employment generally ends with the projects’ completion our appraisal gross margin for 2008 is higher than the prior year due to cost savings associated with a significant complex reappraisal project 

our blended gross margin in 2008 was higher than the prior year in large part due to leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale with resulting increases in gross margin for each revenue category 

  selling general and administrative expenses 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our selling general and administrative “sga” expenses for the following years ended december 31 

 

excluding the impact of acquisitions our fulltime equivalent sga employee count increased 9 from 2007 

  research and development expense 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the following years ended december 31 

 

research and development expense mainly consist of costs associated with the microsoft dynamics ax project in addition to costs associated with other new product development efforts in january 2007 we entered into a strategic alliance with microsoft corporation to jointly develop core public sector functionality for microsoft dynamics ax to address the accounting needs of public sector organizations worldwide research and development costs increased over the prior year because the microsoft dynamics ax development effort was not fully staffed until mid2007 in 2008 and 2007 we offset our research and development expense by 18 million and 16 million respectively which were the amounts earned under the terms of our research and development agreement with microsoft we amended this agreement in september 2008 to define the scope of reimbursable development through the balance of the project and now expect to offset research and development expense by approximately 850000 each quarter through the end of 2010 the actual amount and timing of future research and development costs and related reimbursements and whether they are capitalized or expensed may vary 

  noncash legal settlement related to warrants 

on june 27 2008 we settled outstanding litigation related to the warrants owned by bana as disclosed in prior sec filings the warrants entitled bana to acquire 16 million shares of tyler common stock at an exercise price of 250 per share following courtordered mediation in july 2008 bana paid us 20 million and we issued to bana 801883 restricted shares of tyler common stock accordingly we recorded a noncash legal settlement related to warrants charge of 90 million which is not tax deductible 

  amortization of customer and trade name intangibles 

acquisition intangibles are comprised of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that is allocated to acquired software and customer and trade name intangibles the remaining excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues while amortization expense of customer and trade name intangibles is recorded as a nonoperating expense the estimated useful lives of both customer and trade name intangibles are 5 to 25 years the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the following years ended december 31 

 

in 2008 we completed three acquisitions which increased amortizable customer and trade name intangibles by 123 million this amount will be amortized over approximately 11 years 

estimated annual amortization expense relating to customer and trade name acquisition intangibles excluding acquired software for which the amortization expense is recorded as cost of revenues for the next five years is as follows in thousands 

 

  other 

interest income was the main component of other income in both 2008 and 2007 other income in 2008 also includes nonusage and other fees associated with a credit agreement entered into in october 2008 interest income in 2008 was 11 million compared to 18 million in 2007 interest income declined due to lower invested cash balances and slightly lower interest rates our invested cash balances declined due to increased purchases of treasury stock and investments in office buildings and land in 2008 

  income tax provision 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the following years ended december 31 

 

our effective income tax rate increased approximately twelve points compared to the prior year due to a noncash legal settlement related to warrants charge of 90 million which was not deductible the effective income tax rates were different from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of 35 primarily due to noncash legal settlement related to warrants charge which was not deductible as well as state income taxes nondeductible sharebased compensation expense the qualified manufacturing activities deduction and nondeductible meals and entertainment costs 

slightly less than half of our stock option awards qualify as an incentive stock option “iso” for income tax purposes as such a tax benefit is not recorded at the time the compensation cost related to the options is recorded for book purposes due to the fact that an iso does not ordinarily result in a tax benefit unless there is a disqualifying disposition nonqualified stock options result in the creation of a deferred tax asset which is a temporary difference until the time that the option is exercised due to the treatment of isos for tax purposes our effective tax rate from year to year is subject to variability 

2007 compared to 2006 

  revenues 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our revenues for the following years ended december 31 

 

software licenses  software license revenues consist of the following components for the following years ended december 31 

 

changes in software license revenues consist of the following components 

 

subscriptions in 2007 new asp customers provided approximately twothirds of the subscription revenue increase due to further expansion into existing markets and new markets such as pennsylvania and texas 

software services  changes in software services revenues consist of the following components 

 

maintenance  maintenance revenues increased over the prior year due to growth in our installed customer base and slightly higher maintenance rates on most of our solutions 

appraisal services  appraisal services revenue for 2007 was 8 higher than 2006 the increase was due to activity related to ohio’s revaluation cycle which occurs every six years and a 40 million contract with fulton county georgia which began late in 2006 the ohio revaluation projects began with smaller counties late in the first quarter of 2006 and expanded to larger counties by the third quarter of 2006 a substantial portion of the ohio revaluation projects was complete by december 31 2007 

  cost of revenues and gross margins 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues and those components stated as a percentage of related revenues for the following years ended december 31 

 

the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the periods presented for the following years ended december 31 

 

software license  in 2007 our software license gross margin percentage increased slightly compared to the prior year because our product mix in 2007 included less third party software which has higher associated costs than proprietary software the gross margin also benefited from lower amortization expense of software development costs because some products became fully amortized during the first quarter of 2006 

software services maintenance and subscriptionbased services  in 2007 the software services maintenance and subscription gross margin percentage increased 16 over the prior year because maintenance and various other services such as asp and disaster recovery costs typically grow at a slower rate than related revenues due to leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale we increased our implementation and support staff by 162 fulltime equivalent employees since december 31 2006 this increase includes 73 additional employees related to acquisitions completed in 2007 the remaining additions were to increase our capacity to train and deliver our contract backlog particularly for our courts and justice solutions 

appraisal services  in 2007 higher revenues associated with increased activity on the ohio revaluation projects contributed to the slight appraisal services gross margin percentage increase 

our blended gross margin for 2007 was flat compared to the prior year due to a revenue mix that included less software license and significant additions to our development and implementation staff to deliver our growing backlog software license revenue inherently has higher gross margins than other revenues such as professional services and hardware although the revenue mix for 2007 also included less software license than the prior year the negative impact on the gross margin was offset by lower third party software costs as well as lower amortization expense of software development costs described above 

  selling general and administrative expenses 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our selling general and administrative “sga” expenses for the following years ended december 31 

 

sga costs grew at a slower rate than revenues in 2007 due to leverage in the utilization of our administrative and sales staff 

  research and development expense 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the following years ended december 31 

 

for 2007 research and development expense included costs associated with the microsoft dynamics ax project in addition to costs associated with other new product development efforts in 2007 we reduced our research and development expense by 16 million which was the amount earned under the terms of our strategic alliance with microsoft 

  other 

in 2007 interest income was the main component of other income other income in 2006 also includes nonusage and other fees associated with a credit agreement we terminated in january 2007 and gains and losses on risk management liabilities and assets associated with a foreign exchange contract interest income in 2007 was 18 million compared to 14 million in 2006 the increase in interest income was due to higher invested cash balances as the result of positive cash flow in 2007 

  income tax provision 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the following years ended december 31 

 

the effective income tax rates were different from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of 35 primarily due to state income taxes nondeductible sharebased compensation expense the qualified manufacturing activities deduction and nondeductible meals and entertainment costs 

the effective rate for 2006 was lower than the 2007 effective tax rate mainly due to changes in the texas franchise tax law and rates enacted in the second quarter of 2006 and favorable state income tax audit results 

financial condition and liquidity 

as of december 31 2008 we had cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash equivalents of 68 million and current and noncurrent investments of 46 million compared to cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash equivalents of 141 million and shortterm investments of 416 million at december 31 2007 as of december 31 2008 we had outstanding borrowings of 80 million and outstanding letters of credit totaling 51 million to secure surety bonds required by some of our customer contracts 

the following table sets forth a summary of cash flows for the years ended december 31 

 

net cash provided by operating activities continues to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures other capital resources include cash on hand public and private issuances of debt and equity securities and bank borrowings the capital and credit markets have become more volatile and tight as a result of adverse conditions that have caused the failure and near failure of a number of large financial services companies it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited by these or other factors notwithstanding the foregoing at this time we believe that cash provided by operating activities cash on hand and our revolving credit agreement are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures income tax obligations and share repurchases for the foreseeable future 

in 2008 operating activities provided net cash of 478 million primarily generated from net income of 149 million noncash legal settlement related to warrants charge of 90 million noncash depreciation and amortization charges of 126 million noncash sharebased compensation expense of 38 million and a decrease in net operating assets of 85 million net operating assets declined mainly due to several advance payments from customers offset somewhat by an increase in annual maintenance billings processed in december 

our shortterm and noncurrent investments availableforsale consist of auction rate municipal securities “ars” which are collateralized debt obligations supported by municipal and state agencies and do not include mortgagebacked securities shortterm investments availableforsale consist of ars which were sold at par during the period january 1 2009 through february 20 2009 

all of our noncurrent ars are reflected at estimated fair value in the balance sheet at december 31 2008 in prior periods due to the auction process which took place every 28 to 35 days for most ars quoted market prices were readily available which would have qualified as level 1 under statement of financial accounting standards no 157 “fair value measurements” however due to recent events in credit markets beginning during the first quarter of 2008 the auction events for most of these securities failed therefore quoted prices in active markets are no longer available and we determined the estimated fair values of these securities as of december 31 2008 utilizing a discounted trinomial model 

in association with this estimate of fair value we have recorded an after tax temporary unrealized loss on our noncurrent ars of 387000 net of related tax effects of 209000 in 2008 which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our balance sheet as of december 31 2008 we have continued to earn and collect interest on all of our ars we believe that this temporary decline in fair value is due entirely to liquidity issues because the underlying assets of these securities are supported by municipal and state agencies and do not include mortgagebacked securities have redemption features which call for redemption at 100 of par value and have a current credit rating of a or aaa the ratings on the ars take into account credit support through insurance policies guaranteeing each of the bonds’ payment of principal and accrued interest if it becomes necessary in addition we do not plan to sell any of the ars prior to maturity at an amount below the original purchase value and at this time do not deem it probable that we will receive less than 100 of the principal and accrued interest based on our cash and cash equivalents balance of 68 million expected operating cash flows and the liquidation of 775000 of ars subsequent to the period ending december 31 2008 we do not believe a lack of liquidity associated with our ars will adversely affect our ability to conduct business and believe we have the ability to hold the securities throughout the currently estimated recovery period we have classified these securities as noncurrent because we believe the market for these securities may take in excess of twelve months to fully recover we will continue to evaluate any changes in the market value of our noncurrent ars and in the future depending upon existing market conditions we may be required to record an otherthantemporary decline in market value 

at december 31 2008 our days sales outstanding “dsos” were 99 days compared to dsos of 95 days at december 31 2007 dsos are calculated based on accounts receivable excluding longterm receivables divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by 360 days the increase in dsos is primarily due to an increase in maintenance billings processed in december 

investing activities used cash of 96 million in 2008 compared to 343 million in 2007 in 2008 we liquidated 364 million of ars investments for cash at par and we completed the acquisitions of school information systems inc versatrans solutions inc and certain assets of olympia computing company inc dba schoolmaster to expand our presence in the education market the combined purchase price excluding cash acquired and including transaction costs was approximately 239 million in cash and approximately 196000 shares of tyler common stock valued at 29 million in connection with plans to consolidate workforces and support planned longterm growth we paid 33 million which included 21 million for land for an office development in lubbock texas we also paid 127 million for an office building land and a related tenant lease in yarmouth maine capital expenditures and acquisitions were funded from cash generated from operations 

investing activities in 2007 included cash payments of 90 million for the acquisitions of edp enterprises inc advanced data systems inc and certain other software assets other investing activities during 2007 were 221 million net of sales to purchase ars investments and 37 million in property and equipment the property and equipment expenditures were related to computer hardware and software and other asset additions to support internal growth investing activities in 2006 include cash payments of 122 million and 325000 shares of tyler common stock for the acquisitions of mazikusa inc and tacs inc and certain maintenance and support agreements associated with one of our financial solutions other investing activities during 2006 were capital expenditures of 43 million including 41 million for computer hardware and purchased software for internal use including a new enterprisewide customer relationship management system and other asset additions to support internal growth

subsequent to december 31 2008 and through february 20 2009 we purchased approximately 419000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate cash purchase price of 51 million 

on october 20 2008 we entered into a revolving bank credit agreement the “credit facility” and a related pledge and security agreement the credit facility matures october 19 2009 and provides for total borrowings of up to 250 million and a 60 million letter of credit facility under which the bank will issue cash collateralized letters of credit borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a rate of either libor plus 1 or prime rate minus 15 as of december 31 2008 our effective interest rate was 147 under the credit facility the effective average interest rate for borrowings during the period october 20 through december 31 2008 was 21 the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our personal property the credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial conditions and prohibits us from making certain investments advances cash dividends or loans restricts the amount of our common stock we may purchase and the limits incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens we expect borrowings to fund discretionary purchases of our common stock or fund acquisitions and these covenants are not expected to impact our financial condition or operating performance as of december 31 2008 we were in compliance with those covenants 

as of december 31 2008 we had outstanding borrowings of 80 million and unused available borrowing capacity of 170 million under the credit facility in addition as of december 31 2008 our bank had issued outstanding letters of credit totaling 51 million 

to secure surety bonds required by some of our customer contracts these letters of credit have been collateralized by restricted cash balances invested in a certificate of deposit these letters of credit expire through mid2009 

excluding acquisitions we anticipate that 2009 capital spending will be between 140 million and 160 million approximately 110 million of these expenditures will be incurred to complete the construction of an office development in lubbock texas the remainder of our 2009 expenditures are primarily related to computer equipment and software for infrastructure expansions we currently do not expect to capitalize significant amounts related to software development in 2009 but the actual amount and timing of those costs and whether they are capitalized or expensed may result in additional capitalized software development capital spending in 2009 is expected to be funded from existing cash balances and cash flows from operations 

from time to time we engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates in order to pursue such opportunities which could require significant commitments of capital we may be required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive securities in the future no assurance can be given as to our future acquisition opportunities and how such opportunities will be financed 

we lease office facilities as well as transportation computer and other equipment used in our operations under noncancelable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through 2013 most leases contain renewal options and some contain purchase options following are the future obligations under noncancelable leases at december 31 2008 in thousands

description of business

tyler was founded in 1966 prior to 1998 we operated as a diversified industrial conglomerate with operations in various industrial retail and distribution businesses all of which have been divested in 1997 we embarked on a multiphase growth plan focused on serving the specialized information management needs of local governments nationwide in 1998 and 1999 we entered the local government it market through a series of strategic acquisitions of companies in the local government it market 

market overview 

the state and local government market is one of the largest and most decentralized it markets in the country consisting of all 50 states approximately 3100 counties 36000 cities and towns and 14200 school districts this market is also comprised of approximately 35000 special districts and other agencies each with specialized delegated responsibilities and unique information management requirements 

traditionally local government bodies and agencies performed statemandated duties including property assessment record keeping road maintenance law enforcement administration of election and judicial functions and the provision of welfare assistance today a host of emerging and urgent issues are confronting local governments each of which demands a service response these areas include criminal justice and corrections administration and finance public safety health and human services and public works transfers of responsibility from the federal and state governments to county and municipal governments and agencies in these and other areas also place additional service and financial requirements on these local government units in addition constituents of local governments are increasingly demanding improved service and better access to information from public entities as a result local governments recognize the increasing value of information management systems and services to among other things improve revenue collection provide increased access to information and streamline delivery of services to their constituents local government bodies are now recognizing that “egovernment” is an additional responsibility for community development from integrated tax systems to integrated civil and criminal justice information systems many counties and cities have benefited significantly from the implementation of jurisdictionwide systems that allow different agencies or government offices to share data and provide a more comprehensive approach to information management many city and county governmental agencies also have unique individual information management requirements which must be tailored to the specific functions of each particular office 

many local governments also have difficulties attracting and retaining the staff necessary to support their it functions as a result they seek to establish longterm relationships with reliable providers of high quality it products and services such as tyler 

although local governments generally face budgetary constraints in their operations their primary revenue sources are usually property taxes and to a lesser extent utility fees which tend to be relatively stable in addition the acquisition of new technology typically enables local governments to operate more efficiently and often provides a measurable return on investment that justifies the purchase of software and related services 

gartner estimates that state and local government it spending will grow from 501 billion in 2008 to 575 billion in 2011 with local government accounting for 256 billion of it spending in 2008 and 290 billion in 2011 the external services and software segments of the market where our business is primarily focused is expected to expand from 135 billion in 2008 to 159 billion in 2011

we also offer certain software solutions on an outsourced basis for customers who do not wish to maintain update and operate these systems or to make large upfront capital expenditures to implement these advanced technologies for these customers we host the applications and data at one of our data centers customers typically pay monthly fees under multiyear contracts for these subscriptionbased services 

historically we have had a greater proportion of our annual revenues in the second half of our fiscal year due to governmental budget and spending cycles and the timing of system implementations for customers desiring to “go live” at the beginning of the calendar year

subscriptionbased services 

subscriptionbased services revenue primarily consists of revenues derived from asp arrangements and other hosted service offerings software subscriptions and disaster recovery services our asp arrangements and other hosted service offerings provide certain software solutions on an outsourced basis for customers who do not wish to maintain update and operate these systems or to make large upfront capital expenditures to implement these advanced technologies 

asp arrangements and other hosting services are typically for a period of three to six years and automatically renew unless either party cancels the agreement other software subscriptions and disaster recovery service arrangements are typically under annual contracts the majority of the asp and other hosting services and software subscriptions also include professional services and maintenance and support services in certain asp arrangements the customer also acquires a license to the software 

software services 

we provide a variety of professional it services to customers who utilize our software products virtually all of our customers contract with us for installation training and data conversion services in connection with their purchase of tyler’s software products the complete implementation process for a typical system includes planning design data conversion setup and testing at the culmination of the implementation process an installation team travels to the customer’s facility to ensure the smooth transfer of data to the new system installation fees are charged separately to customers on either a fixedfee or hourly charge basis depending on the contract with full passthrough to customers of travel and other outofpocket expenses 

both in connection with the installation of new systems and on an ongoing basis we provide extensive training services and programs related to our products and services training can be provided in our training centers onsite at customers’ locations or at meetings and conferences and can be customized to meet customers’ requirements the vast majority of our customers contract with us for training services both to improve their employees’ proficiency and productivity and to fully utilize the functionality of our systems training services are generally billed on an hourly basis along with travel and other expenses 

maintenance and support 

following the implementation of our software systems we provide ongoing software support services to assist our customers in operating the systems and to periodically update the software support is provided over the phone to customers through help desks staffed by our customer support representatives for more complicated issues our staff with the customers’ permission can log on to customers’ systems remotely we maintain our customers’ software largely through releases that contain improvements and incremental additions along with updates necessary because of legislative or regulatory changes 

virtually all of our software customers contract with us for maintenance and support which provides us with a significant source of recurring revenue we generally provide maintenance and support under annual contracts with a typical fee based on a percentage of the software product’s license fee these fees can be increased annually and may also increase as new license fees increase maintenance and support fees are generally paid in advance for the entire maintenance contract period most maintenance contracts automatically renew unless the customer or tyler gives notice of termination prior to expiration similar support is provided to our asp customers and is included in their overall monthly fees which are classified as subscriptionbased revenues 

  

appraisal services 

we are the nation’s largest provider of property appraisal outsourcing services for local government taxing authorities these services include 

 

local government taxing authorities normally reappraise properties from time to time to update values for tax assessment purposes and to maintain equity in the taxing process in some jurisdictions reassessment cycles are mandated by law in others they are discretionary while some taxing jurisdictions perform reappraisals inhouse many local governments outsource this function because of its cyclical nature and because of the specialized knowledge and expertise requirements associated with it our appraisal services business unit has been in this business since 1938 

in some instances we also sell property tax andor appraisal software products in connection with appraisal outsourcing projects while other customers may only engage us to provide appraisal services appraisal outsourcing services are somewhat seasonal in nature to the extent that winter weather conditions reduce the productivity of data collection activities in connection with those projects 

strategy 

our objective is to grow our revenue and earnings internally supplemented by focused strategic acquisitions the key components of our business strategy are to 

 

  

our customer base to include more large governments while our traditional market focus has primarily been on small and midsized governments our increased size and market presence together with the technological advances and improved scalability of certain of our products are allowing us to achieve success in selling to larger customers 

 

 

 

sales marketing and customers 

we market our products and services through direct sales and marketing personnel located throughout the united states other inhouse sales staff focuses on addon sales professional services and support 

sales of new systems are typically generated from referrals from other government offices or departments within a county or municipality referrals from other local governments relationships established between sales representatives and county or local officials contacts at trade shows direct mailings and direct contact from prospects already familiar with us we are active in numerous national state county and local government associations and participate in annual meetings trade shows and educational events 

 

customers consist primarily of county and municipal agencies school districts and other local government offices in counties customers include the auditor treasurer tax assessorcollector county clerk district clerk county and district court judges probation officers sheriff and county appraiser at municipal government sites customers include directors from various departments including administration finance utilities public works code enforcement personnel purchasing taxation municipal court and police contracts for software products and services are generally implemented over periods of three months to one year with annually renewing maintenance and support update agreements thereafter although either the customer or we can terminate these agreements historically almost all support and maintenance agreements are automatically renewed annually contracts for appraisal outsourcing services are generally one to three years in duration during 2007 approximately 39 of our revenue was attributable to ongoing support and maintenance agreements 

competition 

we compete with numerous local regional and national firms that provide or offer some or many of the same products and services that we provide most of these competitors are smaller companies that may be able to offer less expensive solutions than ours many of these firms operate within a specific geographic area andor in a narrow product or service niche we also compete with national firms some of which have greater financial and technical resources than we do including oracle corporation lawson software inc sap ag maximus inc affiliated computer services inc sungard data systems inc new world systems and manatron inc in addition we sometimes compete with consulting and systems integration firms such as bearingpoint inc which develop custom systems primarily for larger governments we also occasionally compete with central internal information service departments of local governments which require us to persuade the enduser department to discontinue service by its own personnel and outsource the service to us we compete on a variety of factors including price service name recognition reputation technological capabilities and the ability to modify existing products and services to accommodate the individual requirements of the customer our ability to offer an integrated system of applications for several offices or departments is often a competitive strength local governmental units often are required to seek competitive proposals through a request for proposal process 

suppliers 

all computers peripherals printers scanners operating system software office automation software and other equipment necessary for the implementation and provision of our software systems and services are presently available from several thirdparty sources hardware is purchased on original equipment manufacturer or distributor terms at discounts from retail we have not experienced any significant supply problems 

backlog 

at december 31 2007 our estimated revenue backlog was approximately 2501 million compared to 2059 million at december 31 2006 the backlog represents signed contracts under which the products have not been delivered or the services have not been performed as of yearend approximately 1652 million of the backlog is expected to be recognized during 2008 

intellectual property proprietary rights and licenses 

we regard certain features of our internal operations software and documentation as confidential and proprietary and rely on a combination of contractual restrictions trade secret laws and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property we generally do not rely on patents we believe that due to the rapid rate of technological change in the computer software industry trade secrets and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as knowledge ability and experience of our employees frequent product enhancements and timeliness and quality of support services we typically license our software products under nonexclusive license agreements which are generally nontransferable and have a perpetual term 

employees 

at december 31 2007 we had 1627 employees appraisal outsourcing projects are cyclical in nature and can be widely dispersed geographically we often hire temporary employees to assist in these projects whose term of employment generally ends with the project’s completion none of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to collective bargaining agreements we consider our relations with our employees to be positive

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk investors evaluating our company should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this annual report any of the following factors could materially harm our business operating results and financial condition additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business operating results and financial condition this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report we may make forwardlooking statements from time to time both written and oral we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forwardlooking statements our actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forwardlooking statements due to a number of factors including those set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report 

a decline in information technology spending may result in a decrease in our revenues or lower our growth rate 

a decline in the demand for information technology among our current and prospective customers may result in decreased revenues or a lower growth rate for us because our sales depend in part on our customers’ level of funding for new or additional information technology systems and services moreover demand for our solutions may be reduced by a decline in overall demand for computer software and services accordingly we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase or maintain our revenues 

our products are complex and we run the risk of errors or defects with new product introductions or enhancements 

software products as complex as those developed by us may contain errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released although we have not experienced material adverse effects resulting from any such defects or errors to date we cannot assure you that material defects and errors will not be found after commencement of product shipments any such defects could result in loss of revenues or delay market acceptance 

our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims it is possible however that we may not always be able to negotiate such provisions in our contracts with customers or that the limitation of liability provisions contained in our license agreements may not be effective as a result of existing or future federal state or local laws ordinances or judicial decisions although we maintain errors and omissions and general liability insurance and we try to structure our contracts to include limitations on liability we cannot assure you that a successful claim could not be made or would not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may experience fluctuations in quarterly revenue that could adversely impact our stock price and our operating results 

our actual revenues in a quarter could fall below expectations which could lead to a decline in our stock price our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter revenues from license fees in any quarter depend substantially upon our contracting activity and our ability to recognize revenues in that quarter in accordance with our revenue recognition policies our quarterly revenue may fluctuate and may be difficult to forecast for a variety of reasons including the following 

 

fluctuation in our quarterly revenues may adversely affect our operating results in each fiscal quarter our expense levels operating costs and hiring plans are based on projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed if our actual revenues fall below expectations we could experience a reduction in operating results 

as with other software vendors we may be required to delay revenue recognition into future periods which could adversely impact our operating results 

we have in the past had to and in the future may have to defer revenue recognition for license fees due to several factors including whether 

 

because of the factors listed above and other specific requirements under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states for software revenue recognition we must have very precise terms in our license agreements in order to recognize revenue when we initially deliver and install software or perform services negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions can extend the sales cycle and sometimes we do not obtain terms and conditions that permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery or even as work on the project is completed 

compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 new securities and exchange commission regulations and new york stock exchange rules are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours the costs required to comply with such evolving laws are difficult to predict to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards this investment may result in an unforeseen increase in general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities which may harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins and adversely affect our operating results 

we realize lower margins on software and appraisal service revenues than on license revenue the majority of our contracts include both software licenses and professional services therefore an increase in the percentage of software service and appraisal service revenue compared to license revenue could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and could adversely affect operating results 

selling products and services into the public sector poses unique challenges 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of software and services to state county and city governments other municipal agencies and other public entities we expect that sales to public sector customers will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues in the future we face many risks and challenges associated with contracting with governmental entities including 

 

each of these risks is outside our control if we fail to adequately adapt to these risks and uncertainties our financial performance could be adversely affected 

the open bidding process for governmental contracts creates uncertainty in predicting future contract awards 

many governmental agencies purchase products and services through an open bidding process generally a governmental entity will publish an established list of requirements requesting potential vendors to propose solutions for the established requirements to respond successfully to these requests for proposals we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract the time required to establish operations for the proposed client and the likely terms of any other third party proposals submitted we cannot guarantee that we will win any bids in the future through the request for proposal process or that any winning bids will ultimately result in contracts on favorable terms our failure to secure contracts through the open bidding process or to secure such contracts on favorable terms may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

fixed price contracts may affect our profits 

some of our present contracts are on a fixedpriced basis which can lead to various risks including 

 

if we do not adequately assess these and other risks we may be subject to cost overruns and penalties which may harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

we face significant competition from other vendors and potential new entrants into our markets 

we believe we are a leading provider of integrated solutions for the public sector however we face competition from a variety of software vendors that offer products and services similar to those offered by us as well as from companies offering to develop custom software we compete on the basis of a number of factors including 

 

we believe the market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors that vary in size primary computer platforms and overall product scope our competitors include the consulting divisions of national and regional accounting firms publicly held companies that focus on selected segments of the public sector market and a significant number of smaller privately held companies certain competitors have greater technical marketing and financial resources than we do we cannot assure you that such competitors will not develop products or offer services that are superior to our products or services or that achieve greater market acceptance 

we also compete with internal centralized information service departments of governmental entities which require us to persuade the enduser to stop the internal service and outsource to us in addition our customers may elect in the future to provide information management services internally through new or existing departments which could reduce the market for our services 

we could face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the public sector software application market and new products and technologies are introduced increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share in addition current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with thirdparties thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share further competitive pressures could require us to reduce the price of our software licenses and related services we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the failure to do so would have material adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition 

we must respond to rapid technological changes to be competitive 

the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards in computer hardware and software technology changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result our future success will depend in part upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products and develop and introduce in a timely manner or acquire new products that keep pace with technological developments satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and costeffective manner further we cannot assure you that the products capabilities or technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive if we are unable to develop or acquire on a timely and costeffective basis new software products or enhancements to existing products or if such new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance our business operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

our failure to properly manage growth could adversely affect our business 

we have expanded our operations since february 1998 when we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector we intend to continue expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities this growth places a significant demand on management and operational resources in order to manage growth effectively we must implement and improve our operational systems procedures and controls on a timely basis we must also identify hire train and manage key managerial and technical personnel if we fail to implement these systems or employ and retain such qualified personnel our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to hire integrate and retain qualified personnel 

our continued success will depend upon the availability and performance of our key management sales marketing customer support and product development personnel the loss of key management or technical personnel could adversely affect us we believe that our continued success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract integrate and retain such personnel we have at times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel competition for qualified software development sales and other personnel is intense and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

we may experience difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy 

in addition a significant portion of our growth has resulted from strategic acquisitions in new product and geographic markets although our future focus will be on internal growth we will continue to identify and pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances with suitable candidates our future success will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate future acquisitions and other strategic alliances into our operations acquisitions may involve a number of special risks including diversion of management’s attention failure to retain key acquired personnel unanticipated events or circumstances legal liabilities and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we conduct due diligence reviews of potential acquisition candidates we may not identify all material liabilities or risks related to acquisition candidates there can be no assurance that any such strategic acquisitions or alliances will be accomplished on favorable terms or will result in profitable operations 

we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights 

many of our product and service offerings incorporate proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of contracts copyrights and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology we cannot be certain that we have taken all appropriate steps to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property in addition there has been significant litigation in the united states in recent years involving intellectual property rights we are not currently involved in any material intellectual property litigation we may however be a party to intellectual property litigation in the future to protect our proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights further we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us in the future with respect to current or future products any claims or litigation with or without merit could be timeconsuming and result in costly litigation and diversion of management’s attention further any claims and litigation could cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements such royalty or licensing arrangements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all thus litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations regardless of the final outcome of such litigation 

our application service provider strategy has yet to gain widespread acceptance 

some businesses choose to access enterprise software applications through application service providers or asps which are businesses that host applications and provide access to software on a subscription basis the public sector market for asp solutions is new and unproven acceptance of our asp model depends upon the ability and willingness of different governmental entities to accept and implement asp solutions some prospective clients have expressed security and privacy concerns with the asp model including a concern regarding the confidential nature of the information and transactions available from and conducted with governments and concerns regarding offsite storage of such information we have limited experience selling our solutions through asps and may not be successful in generating revenue from this distribution channel 

changes in the insurance markets may affect our ability to win some contract awards and may lead to increased expenses 

some of our customers primarily those for our property appraisal services require that we secure performance bonds before they will select us as their vendor the number of qualified highrated insurance companies that offer performance bonds has decreased in recent years while the costs associated with securing these bonds has increased dramatically in addition we are generally required to issue a letter of credit as security for the issuance of a performance bond we periodically enter into longterm borrowing agreements and each letter of credit we issue without corresponding cash collateral may reduce our borrowing capacity under the borrowing agreement we cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure such performance bonds in the future on terms that are favorable to us if at all our inability to obtain performance bonds on favorable terms or at all could impact our future ability to win some contract awards particularly large property appraisal services contracts which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

recent volatility in the stock markets increasing shareholder litigation the adoption of expansive legislation that redefines corporate controls in particular legislation adopted to prevent future corporate and accounting scandals as well as other factors have recently led to significant increases in premiums for directors’ and officers’ liability insurance the number of insurers offering directors and officers insurance at competitive rates has also decreased in recent years volatility of the insurance market may result in future increases in our general and administrative expenses which may adversely affect future operating results 

our stock price may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and may be significantly affected by many different factors some examples of factors that can have a significant impact on our stock price include 

 

in addition the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for the common stock of technology companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company we cannot assure you that similar litigation will not occur in the future with respect to us such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition 

historically we have not paid dividends on our common stock 

we have not declared or paid a cash dividend since we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector in february 1998 additionally we may enter into credit agreements that could restrict our ability to pay cash dividends we intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law could deter takeover attempts 

our board of directors may issue up to 1000000 shares of preferred stock and may determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting and conversion rights of these shares of preferred stock these determinations may be made without any further vote or action by our stockholders the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock in addition some provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and of the delaware general corporation law could also delay prevent or make more difficult a merger tender offer or proxy contest involving us 

financial outlook 

from time to time in press releases and otherwise we may publish forecasts or other forwardlooking statements regarding our results including estimated revenues or net earnings any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties and as a matter of course any number of them may prove to be incorrect further the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors including those described in this discussion many of which are beyond our control as a result we cannot be certain that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse current and potential stockholders are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions but instead are encouraged to utilize our entire publicly available mix of historical and forwardlooking information as well as other available information regarding us our products and services and the software industry when evaluating our prospective results of operations

we occupy a total of approximately 297000 square feet of office and warehouse space 42000 of which we own we lease our principal executive office located in dallas texas as well as other offices for our divisions in colorado iowa maine ohio texas and washington 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

prior to september 11 2007 we had warrants outstanding to purchase 16 million shares of common stock at 250 per share which were held by bank of america n a “boa” pursuant to the terms of two amended and restated stock purchase warrants collectively the “warrants” the exercise price could be paid either in cash or by a “cashless exercise” in which the holder was required to surrender the warrants in exchange for warrant shares based on the following formula market price – 250  market price x 1 6 million shares with the market price calculated as the immediately preceding 60day trading average of our common stock the warrants identified specific exercise procedures for each method of exercise and further provided that any exercise would not be effective until we received all applicable documents instruments and the purchase price the warrants were originally issued on september 10 1997 and were exercisable from that date until 5 pm central time september 10 2007 when they expired 

on september 10 2007 at 444 pm central time boa attempted to effectuate a “cashless exercise” of the warrants via email however we believe boa did not comply with all of the requirements set forth in the warrants for an effective exercise at 537 pm central time boa recalled this email exercise notice which we subsequently accepted at 610 pm central time boa attempted to effectuate a cash exercise of the warrants by emailing a different notice of exercise which we believe also failed to comply with all of the requirements set forth in the warrants for an effective exercise and in any event was after the expiration date of the warrants as a result we believe these warrants expired as of september 10 2007 and have excluded the effect of the warrants from potentially dilutive common shares as of such date in our earnings per share computation 

on october 12 2007 we filed a declaratory judgment action against boa in the district court of dallas county texas 101 st judicial district requesting the court to declare among other things that the warrants have expired pursuant to their terms on november 14 2007 boa filed an original answer and counterclaim asserting among other things that the parties modified the exercise requirements of the warrants that tyler breached the alleged modified contracts by refusing to deliver the warrant shares to boa and that boa is therefore entitled to specific performance of the warrants by us delivering the warrant shares or in the alternative to a recovery of damages including attorneys’ fees interest and costs while we believe the warrants expired as of september 10 2007 there can be no assurance as to the ultimate resolution of this matter 

other than ordinary course routine litigation incidental to our business and except as described in this annual report there are no material legal proceedings pending to which we are party or to which any of our properties are subject

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements the reported amounts of revenues cost of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the notes to the consolidated financial statements included as part of this annual report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the application of the percentageofcompletion and proportionate performance methods of revenue recognition the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of intangible assets determination of sharebased compensation expense and valuation allowance for receivables we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of statement of position “sop” 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended by sop 984 and sop 989 as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants and in accordance with the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” we recognize revenue on our appraisal services contracts using the proportionate performance method of accounting with considerations for the provisions of emerging issue task force “eitf” no 0021 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” our revenues are derived from sales of software licenses subscriptionbased services appraisal services maintenance and support and services that typically range from installation training and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs for multiple element software arrangements which do not entail the performance of services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software we generally record revenue when the delivered products or performed services result in a legally enforceable and nonrefundable claim we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized because most of our customers are governmental entities we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments in a limited number of cases we encounter a customer who is dissatisfied with some aspect of the software product or our service and we may offer a “concession” to such customer in those limited situations where we grant a concession we rarely reduce the contract arrangement fee but alternatively may perform additional services such as additional training or programming a minor feature the customer had in their prior software solution these amounts have historically been considered nominal in connection with our customer contracts and the adequacy of related allowances and measures of progress towards contract completion our project managers are charged with the responsibility to continually review the status of each customer on a specific contract basis also we review on at least a quarterly basis significant past due accounts receivable and the adequacy of related reserves events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments may require revision include but are not limited to deterioration of a customer’s financial condition failure to manage our customer’s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products 

for those software arrangements that involve significant production modification or customization of the software which is considered essential to its functionality and for substantially all property appraisal outsourcing projects we recognize revenue and profit as the work progresses using the percentageofcompletion method and the proportionate performance method of revenue recognition these methods rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue billings and collections and expected contract costs as well as measures of progress toward completion we believe reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs and progress applicable to various stages of a contract can be made at times we perform additional andor noncontractual services for little to no incremental fee to satisfy customer expectations if changes occur in delivery productivity or other factors used in developing our estimates of expected costs or revenues we revise our cost and revenue estimates and any revisions are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision first become known 

we use contract accounting primarily the percentageofcompletion method and apply the provisions of sop no 811 “accounting for performance of construction — type and certain production — type contracts” for those software arrangements that involve significant production modification or customization of the software or where our software services are otherwise considered essential to the functionality of the software in addition we recognize revenue using the proportionate performance method of revenue recognition for our property appraisal projects some of which can range up to three years in connection with these and certain other contracts we may perform the work prior to when the services are billable andor payable pursuant to the contract the termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the fair value of products delivered and services performed in the event of an early termination 

for subscriptionbased services such as application service provider arrangements and other hosting arrangements we evaluate whether each of the elements in these arrangements represents a separate unit of accounting as defined by eitf 0021 using all applicable facts and circumstances including whether i we sell or could readily sell the element unaccompanied by the other elements ii the element has standalone value to the customer iii there is objective reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item and iv there is a general right of return we consider the applicability of eitf no 0003 “application of sop 972 to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity’s hardware” on a contractbycontract basis in hosted termbased agreements where the customer does not have the contractual right to take possession of the software hosting fees are recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the contract commencing when the customer has access to the software for professional services associated with hosting arrangements that we determine do not have standalone value to the customer we recognize the services revenue ratably over the remaining contractual period once hosting has gone live and we may begin billing for the hosting services we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 

in connection with certain of our contracts we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet date many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period management reviews unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue in addition we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue which represents billings in excess of revenue earned the majority of this liability consists of maintenance billings for which payments are made in advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the maintenance period generally one year we also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit and the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product has not been met on a periodic basis we review by customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains appropriate 

intangible assets and goodwill  our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge the cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value with the excess allocated to goodwill accordingly we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets including software customer related intangibles trade name and goodwill in addition we capitalize software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility these intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives all intangible assets with definite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of goodwill is generally measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its fair value generally determined by estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset recoverability of other intangible assets is generally measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows the assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include but are not limited to a significant decrease in the market value of the business or asset acquired a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the 

business or asset acquired is used or a significant adverse change in the business climate in addition products capabilities or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or noncompetitive 

sharebased compensation we have a stock option plan that provides for the grant of stock options to key employees directors and nonemployee consultants prior to january 1 2006 we accounted for sharebased compensation utilizing the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion “apb” no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations accordingly no compensation expense was recorded because the exercise prices of the stock options equaled the market prices of the underlying stock on the dates of grants effective january 1 2006 we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards “ sfas” no 123r “sharebased payment” which establishes accounting for sharebased awards exchanged for employee services using the modified prospective application transition method subsequently we recorded compensation expense in our statement of operations over the service period that the awards are expected to vest 

we estimate the fair value of sharebased awards on the date of grant using the blackscholes option valuation model sharebased compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures which will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from such estimates changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data we estimate stock price volatility at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock estimated option life is determined using the “simplified method” in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 107 determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates 

analysis of results of operations and other 

the following discussion compares the historical results of operations on a basis consistent with gaap for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 

2007 compared to 2006 

revenues 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our revenues for the following years ended december 31 

 

software licenses  software license revenues consist of the following components for the following years ended december 31 

 

in 2007 we signed 86 material new contracts with average software license fees of approximately 434000 compared to 78 material new contracts signed in 2006 with average software license fees of approximately 326000 we consider contracts with a license fee component of 100000 or more to be material although a contract is signed in a particular year the year in which the revenue is recognized may be different because we recognize revenue according to our revenue recognition policy as described in note 1 in the consolidated financial statements 

changes in software license revenues consist of the following components 

 

subscriptions subscriptionbased services revenue primarily consists of revenues derived from application service provider “asp” arrangements and other hosted service offerings software subscriptions and disaster recovery services asp and other software subscriptions agreements are typically for periods of three to six years and automatically renew unless either party cancels the agreement disaster recovery and miscellaneous other hosted service agreements are typically renewable annually new asp customers provided approximately twothirds of the subscription revenue increase due to further expansion into existing markets and new markets such as pennsylvania and texas 

software services  changes in software services revenues consist of the following components 

 

maintenance  we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and third party software maintenance revenues increased over the prior year due to growth in our installed customer base and slightly higher maintenance rates on most of our solutions 

appraisal services  appraisal services are projectoriented and are driven in part by revaluation cycles in various states appraisal services revenue for 2007 was 8 higher than the prior year period the increase was due to activity related to ohio’s revaluation cycle which occurs every six years and a 40 million contract with fulton county georgia which began late in 2006 the ohio revaluation projects began with smaller counties late in the first quarter of 2006 and expanded to larger counties by the third quarter of 2006 a substantial portion of the ohio revaluation projects was complete by december 31 2007 we anticipate appraisal services revenues for 2008 will decline moderately compared to 2007 if we are unable to replace the appraisal services revenues associated with the ohio revaluation 

cost of revenues and gross margins 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues and those components stated as a percentage of related revenues for the following years ended december 31 

 

the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the periods presented for the following years ended december 31 

 

software license  the main component of our cost of software license revenues is amortization expense for capitalized development costs on certain software products with third party software costs making up the balance once a product is released we begin to amortize over the estimated useful life of the product any capitalized costs associated with its development amortization expense is determined on a productbyproduct basis at an annual rate not less than straightline basis over the product’s estimated life which is generally five years development costs consist mainly of personnel costs such as salary and benefits paid to our developers and rent for related office space 

for 2007 our software license gross margin percentage increased slightly compared to the prior year because our product mix in 2007 included less third party software which has higher associated costs than proprietary software the gross margin also benefited from lower amortization expense of software development costs because some products became fully amortized during the first quarter of 2006 

software services maintenance and subscriptionbased services  cost of software services maintenance and subscriptions primarily consists of personnel costs related to installation of our software conversion of customer data training customer personnel and support activities and various other services such as asp and disaster recovery for 2007 the software services maintenance and 

subscription gross margin percentage increased 16 over the prior year because maintenance and various other services such as asp and disaster recovery costs typically grow at a slower rate than related revenues due to leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale we have increased our implementation and support staff by 162 fulltime equivalent employees since december 31 2006 this increase includes 73 additional employees related to acquisitions completed in 2007 the remaining additions were to increase our capacity to train and deliver our contract backlog particularly for our courts and justice solutions 

appraisal services  higher revenues associated with increased activity on the ohio revaluation projects contributed to the slight appraisal services gross margin percentage increase 

our blended gross margin for 2007 was flat compared to the prior year due to a revenue mix that included less software license and significant additions to our development and implementation staff to deliver our growing backlog software license revenue inherently has higher gross margins than other revenues such as professional services and hardware although the revenue mix for 2007 also included less software license than the prior year the negative impact on the gross margin was offset by lower third party software costs as well as lower amortization expense of software development costs described above 

selling general and administrative expenses 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our selling general and administrative “sga” expenses for the following years ended december 31 

 

sga costs grew at a slower rate than revenues in 2007 due to leverage in the utilization of our administrative and sales staff 

research and development expense 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the following years ended december 31 

 

for 2007 research and development expense included costs associated with the microsoft dynamics ax project in addition to costs associated with other new product development efforts in 2007 we reduced our research and development expense by 16 million which was the amount earned under the terms of our strategic alliance with microsoft we anticipate these costs and associated reimbursements from microsoft will continue into 2008 however the actual amount and timing of those costs and related reimbursements and whether they are capitalized or expensed may vary 

amortization of customer and trade name intangibles 

acquisition intangibles are comprised of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that is allocated to acquired software and customer and trade name intangibles the remaining excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues while amortization expense of customer and trade name intangibles is recorded as a nonoperating expense the estimated useful lives of both customer and trade name intangibles are 5 to 25 years the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the following years ended december 31 

 

estimated annual amortization expense relating to customer and trade name acquisition intangibles excluding acquired software for which the amortization expense is recorded as cost of revenues for the next five years is as follows in thousands 

 

other 

in 2007 interest income is the main component of other income other income in 2006 also includes nonusage and other fees associated with a credit agreement we terminated in january 2007 and gains and losses on risk management liabilities and assets associated with a foreign exchange contract interest income in 2007 was 18 million compared to 14 million in 2006 the increase in interest income is due to higher invested cash balances as the result of positive cash flow in 2007 

income tax provision 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the following years ended december 31 

 

the effective income tax rates were different from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of 35 primarily due to state income taxes nondeductible sharebased compensation expense the qualified manufacturing activities deduction and nondeductible meals and entertainment costs 

the effective rate for 2006 was lower than the 2007 effective tax rate mainly due to changes in the texas franchise tax law and rates enacted in the second quarter of 2006 and favorable state income tax audit results 

slightly more than half of our stock option awards granted qualify as incentive stock options “iso” for income tax purposes as such a tax benefit is not recorded at the time the compensation cost related to the options is recorded for book purposes due to the fact that an iso does not ordinarily result in a tax benefit unless there is a disqualifying disposition stock option grants of nonqualified options result in the creation of a deferred tax asset which is a temporary difference until the time that the option is exercised due to the treatment of incentive stock options for tax purposes our effective tax rate from year to year is subject to variability 

2006 compared to 2005 

revenues 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our revenues for the following years ended december 31 

 

software licenses  changes in software license revenues consist of the following components 

 

subscriptions subscriptionbased services increased primarily due to new customers for asp and disaster recovery services as a result of geographic expansion primarily in the south in the aftermath of hurricane katrina 

software services  changes in software services revenues consist of the following components 

 

 

maintenance  we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and third party software maintenance revenues increased due to growth in our installed customer base as evidenced by our software license revenue and slightly higher maintenance rates on most of our product lines 

appraisal services the appraisal services business is driven in part by revaluation cycles in various states appraisal services revenue increased over the prior year mainly due to activity related to ohio’s revaluation cycle which occurs every six years as well as the addition of new customers the ohio revaluation projects began with smaller counties late in the first quarter of 2006 and expanded to larger counties by the third quarter of 2006 

cost of revenues and gross margins 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues and those components stated as a percentage of related revenues for the following years ended december 31 

 

the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the periods presented for the following years ended december 31 

 

software license our software license gross margin percentage in 2006 increased due to substantially higher software license revenues and slightly lower amortization expense of software development costs as some products became fully amortized during the first quarter of 2006 

software services maintenance and subscriptionbased services the software services maintenance and subscriptions gross margin percentage in 2006 was comparable to the 2005 the cost of software services maintenance and subscriptions increased because we added to our implementation and support staff to increase our capacity to support new sales growth and deliver sales backlog 

appraisal services the appraisal services gross margin percentage increased in 2006 compared to 2005 mainly due to significant organizational changes and headcount reductions we made in the second quarter of 2005 to our appraisal services business to bring costs in line with expected levels of revenue in addition margins in 2005 were negatively affected by cost inefficiencies associated with one large contract 

the overall gross margin percentage rose mainly due to a revenue mix that included more software license revenues as well as lower costs as a result of the restructuring of our appraisal services business in the second quarter of 2005 software license revenue inherently has higher gross margins than other revenues such as services and hardware 

  selling general and administrative expenses 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our sga expenses for the following years ended december 31 

 

in 2006 sga includes 20 million of noncash sharebased compensation expense as a result of implementing sfas no 123r in january 2006 partially offsetting these charges were lower sga expenses relating to our appraisal services and appraisal and tax software businesses due to the restructuring of those businesses in the second quarter of 2005 

  research and development expense 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the following years ended december 31 

 

  restructuring charge 

because of unsatisfactory financial performance early in 2005 we made significant organizational changes in the second quarter of 2005 to those areas of our business that were not performing to our expectations our goal was to bring costs in line with expected levels of revenue while improving the efficiency of our organizational structure to ensure that clients continue to receive superior service 

we reorganized the appraisal services business to eliminate levels of management and reduce overhead expense we also took actions to reduce headcount and costs in our appraisal and tax software division and we consolidated certain senior management positions at the corporate office these cost reductions were made in the second quarter of 2005 as a result we eliminated approximately 120 positions including management staff and projectrelated personnel 

in connection with the reorganization we incurred certain charges which were primarily comprised of employee severance costs and related fringe benefits and totaled approximately 13 million before income taxes the related payments were paid in 2005 

  other 

interest income is the main component of other income which also includes nonusage and other fees associated with a credit agreement we terminated in january 2007 gain on sale of certain assets gains and losses on risk management liabilities and assets associated with a foreign exchange contract and miscellaneous other items interest income in 2006 was 14 million compared to 900000 in 2005 

  income tax provision 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the following years ended december 31 

 

the effective rate for 2006 was lower than the prior year mainly due to changes in the texas franchise tax law and rates enacted in the second quarter of 2006 favorable state income tax audit results and lower state income taxes as a result of a change in our corporate structure implemented in early 2005 the decline in the effective tax rate for 2006 was offset somewhat by nondeductible sharebased compensation expense included in 2006 operating results 

financial condition and liquidity 

the following table sets forth a summary of cash flows for the years ended december 31 

 

historically we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily with cash generated from operating activities as of december 31 2007 our combined cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash equivalents and shortterm investments balance was 557 million compared to 417 million at december 31 2006 cash and shortterm investments increased primarily due to continued strong operating performance and higher deferred revenue due to additional maintenance customers and new contract signings 

our shortterm investments are comprised of auction rate municipal securities “ars” ars are longterm variable rate bonds tied to shortterm interest rates that are reset through a “dutch auction” process that occurs every 28 to 35 days we have the option to participate in the auction and sell ars to prospective buyers through a brokerdealer we do not have the right to put the security back to the issuer our investments in ars all had aaa credit ratings at the time of purchase and represent interests in collateralized debt obligations supported by municipal and state agencies ars are considered highly liquid because of the auction process which have historically provided a liquid market for these securities however because the ars have longterm maturity dates there is no guarantee that the holder will be able to liquidate its holdings in the short term as of february 22 2008 our investment in ars was 186 million compared to 416 million at december 31 2007 in 2008 the majority of the auctions we participated in were successful and we expect that we will collect the principal associated with these ars based on the nature of the debt obligations and our ability to liquidate our ars in 2008 we do not believe that any change in the liquidity of the ars market will have a material impact on our liquidity cash flow or ability to fund operations 

at december 31 2007 our days sales outstanding “dsos” were 95 days compared to dsos of 102 days at december 31 2006 dsos are calculated based on accounts receivable excluding longterm receivables divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by 360 days the decline in dsos is primarily due to timing of billings 

investing activities in 2007 include cash payments of 90 million for the acquisitions of edp enterprises inc advanced data systems inc and certain other software assets other investing activities during 2007 were 221 million net of sales to purchase shortterm investments and 37 million in property and equipment the property and equipment expenditures were related to computer hardware and software and other asset additions to support internal growth investing activities in 2006 include total cash payments of 122 million and 325000 shares of tyler common stock for the acquisitions of mazikusa inc and tacs inc and certain maintenance and support agreements associated with one of our financial solutions other investing activities during 2006 

were capital expenditures of 43 million including 41 million for computer hardware and purchased software for internal use including a new enterprisewide customer relationship management system and other asset additions to support internal growth in 2005 investing activities primarily consisted of investments in software development and property and equipment 

cash used in financing activities was primarily comprised of purchases of treasury shares net of proceeds from stock option exercises and contributions from our employee stock purchase plan 

during 2007 we purchased approximately 13 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 162 million 141 million in cash and 21 million in accrued liabilities at december 31 2007 in 2006 we purchased approximately 10 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cash purchase price of 105 million and during 2005 we purchased approximately 25 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cash purchase price of 177 million 

in 2007 we received 36 million from the exercise of options to purchase approximately 878000 shares of our common stock under our employee stock option plan during 2006 we issued 623000 shares of common stock and received 29 million in aggregate proceeds upon exercise of stock options and during 2005 we issued 436000 shares of common stock and received 18 million in aggregate proceeds upon exercise of stock options in 2007 we received 12 million from contributions to the tyler technologies inc employee stock purchase plan “espp” in both 2006 and 2005 we received 10 million from contributions to the espp 

subsequent to december 31 2007 and through february 22 2008 we purchased approximately 814000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate cash purchase price of 105 million 

we maintain a 50 million letter of credit facility under which the bank issues cash collateralized letters of credit as of december 31 2007 we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 45 million to secure surety bonds required by some of our customer contracts 

in the first quarter of 2008 we acquired two companies for a combined cash purchase price net of cash acquired of approximately 138 million and 126000 shares of tyler common stock we have not finalized the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired companies but expect this allocation will result in noncash charges that may have a slightly dilutive effect on earnings per share in 2008 

excluding acquisitions we anticipate that 2008 capital spending will be between 45 million and 55 million the majority of which will be related to computer equipment and software for infrastructure expansions we currently do not expect to capitalize significant amounts related to software development in 2008 but the actual amount and timing of those costs and whether they are capitalized or expensed may result in additional capitalized software development capital spending in 2008 is expected to be funded from existing cash balances and cash flows from operations 

from time to time we engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates in order to pursue such opportunities which could require significant commitments of capital we may be required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive securities in the future no assurance can be given as to our future acquisition opportunities and how such opportunities will be financed in the absence of future acquisitions of other businesses we believe our current cash balances and expected future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital capital expenditures and other activities through the next twelve months if operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our needs we believe that credit would be available to us 

we lease office facilities as well as transportation computer and other equipment used in our operations under noncancelable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through 2013 most leases contain renewal options and some contain purchase options following are the future obligations under noncancelable leases at december 31 2007 in thousands 

 

it is not our usual business practice to enter into offbalance sheet arrangements or to issue guarantees to third parties as of december 31 2007 we have no material purchase commitments except for the operating lease commitments listed above 

capitalization 

at december 31 2007 our capitalization consisted of 1372 million of shareholders’ equity with no debt 

new accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and expands disclosures about fair value measurements we are subject to the provisions of sfas no 157 beginning january 1 2008 the adoption of sfas no 157 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial market prices and interest rates as of december 31 2007 we had funds invested in auction rate municipal securities which we accounted for in accordance with sfas no 115 “accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities” these investments were treated as availableforsale under sfas no 115 the carrying value of these investments approximates fair market value due to the nature of these investments we are not subject to significant market rate risk 

we have no outstanding debt at december 31 2007 and we therefore are not subject to any interest rate risk 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures — our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in securities exchange act rules 13a15e as of december 31 2007 based on such evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that as of december 31 2007 such disclosure controls and procedures were effective and designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the securities exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

internal control over financial reporting — during the quarter ended december 31 2007 there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as defined in securities exchange act rule 13a15f that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting — tyler’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in securities exchange act rule 13a15f tyler’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to tyler’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

management assessed the effectiveness of tyler’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control – integrated framework  based on our assessment we believe that as of december 31 2007 tyler’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria 

management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 has been audited by ernst  young llp the independent registered public accounting firm who also audited tyler’s consolidated financial statements ernst  young’s attestation report on management’s assessment of tyler’s internal control over financial reporting appears on page f2 hereof

tyler was founded in 1966 prior to 1998 we operated as a diversified industrial conglomerate with operations in various industrial retail and distribution businesses all of which have been sold or otherwise disposed in 1997 we embarked on a multiphase growth plan focused on serving the specialized information management needs of local governments nationwide in 1998 and 1999 we made a series of strategic acquisitions of companies in the local government it market 

market overview 

the state and local government market is one of the largest and most decentralized it markets in the country consisting of all 50 states approximately 3100 counties 36000 cities and towns and 14400 school districts this market is also comprised of approximately 35000 special districts and other agencies each with specialized delegated responsibilities and unique information management requirements 

traditionally local government bodies and agencies performed statemandated duties including property assessment record keeping road maintenance law enforcement administration of election and judicial functions and the provision of welfare assistance today a host of emerging and urgent issues are confronting local governments each of which demands a service response these areas include criminal justice and corrections administration and finance public safety health and human services and public works transfers of responsibility from the federal and state governments to county and municipal governments and agencies in these and other areas also place additional service and financial requirements on these local government units in addition constituents of local governments are increasingly demanding improved service and better access to information from public entities as a result local governments recognize the increasing value of information management systems and services to among other things improve revenue collection provide increased access to information and streamline delivery of services to their constituents local government bodies are now recognizing that “egovernment” is an additional responsibility for community development from integrated tax systems to integrated civil and criminal justice information systems many counties and cities have benefited significantly from the implementation of jurisdictionwide systems that allow different agencies or government offices to share data and provide a more comprehensive approach to information management many city and county governmental agencies also have unique individual information management requirements which must be tailored to the specific functions of each particular office 

many local governments also have difficulties attracting and retaining the staff necessary to support their it functions as a result they seek to establish longterm relationships with reliable providers of high quality it products and services such as tyler 

although local governments generally face budgetary constraints in their operations their primary revenue sources are usually property taxes and to a lesser extent utility fees which tend to be relatively stable in addition the acquisition of new technology typically enables local governments to operate more efficiently and often provides a measurable return on investment that justifies the purchase of software and related services 

gartner estimates that state and local government it spending will grow from 484 billion in 2007 to 556 billion in 2010 with local government accounting for 251 billion of it spending in 2007 and 289 billion in 2010 the external services and software 

segments of the market where our business is primarily focused are expected to be the most rapidly growing areas of the local government it market expanding from 131 billion in 2007 to 161 billion in 2010 

products and services 

we provide a comprehensive and flexible suite of products and services that address the information technology needs of cities counties schools and other local government entities we derive our revenues from four primary sources 

 

we design develop and market a broad range of software products to serve missioncritical “backoffice” functions of local governments many of our software applications include internetaccessible solutions that allow for realtime public access to a variety of information or that allow the public to transact business with local governments via the internet our software products and services are generally grouped in four major product areas 

 

each of our core software systems consists of several fully integrated application modules for customers who acquire the software for use inhouse we generally license our systems under standard license agreements that provide the customer with a fully paid nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software in some of the product areas such as financials and property appraisal we offer multiple solutions designed to meet the needs of different sized governments 

we also offer certain software products on an outsourced basis for customers who do not wish to maintain update and operate these systems or to make large upfront capital expenditures to implement these advanced technologies for these customers we host the applications and data at one of our data centers customers typically pay monthly fees under multiyear contracts for these services 

historically we have had a greater proportion of our annual revenues in the second half of our fiscal year due to governmental budget and spending cycles and the timing of system implementations for customers desiring to “go live” at the beginning of the calendar year

both in connection with the installation of new systems and on an ongoing basis we provide extensive training services and programs related to our products and services training can be provided in our training centers onsite at customers’ locations or at meetings and conferences and can be customized to meet customers’ requirements the vast majority of our customers contract with us for training services both to improve their employees’ proficiency and productivity and to fully utilize the functionality of our systems training services are generally billed on an hourly basis along with travel and other expenses

following the implementation of our software systems we provide ongoing software support services to assist our customers in operating the systems and to periodically update the software support is provided over the phone to customers through help desks staffed by our customer support representatives for more complicated issues our staff with the customers’ permission can log on to customers’ systems remotely we maintain our customers’ software largely through releases that contain improvements and incremental additions along with updates necessary because of legislative or regulatory changes 

virtually all of our software customers contract with us for maintenance and support which provides us with a significant source of recurring revenue we generally provide maintenance and support under annual contracts with a typical fee based on a percentage of the software product’s license fee these fees can be increased annually and may also increase as new license fees increase maintenance and support fees are generally paid in advance for the entire maintenance contract period most maintenance contracts automatically renew unless the customer or tyler gives notice of termination prior to expiration similar support is provided to our asp customers and is included in their overall monthly fees 

appraisal services 

we are the nation’s largest provider of property appraisal outsourcing services for local government taxing authorities these services include 

 

local government taxing entities normally reappraise properties from time to time to update values for tax assessment purposes and to maintain equity in the taxing process in some jurisdictions reassessment cycles are mandated by law in others they are discretionary while some taxing jurisdictions perform reappraisals inhouse many local governments outsource this function because of its cyclical nature and because of the specialized knowledge and expertise requirements associated with it our business unit that provides appraisal outsourcing services to local governments has been in this business since 1938 

in some instances we also sell property tax andor appraisal software products in connection with appraisal outsourcing projects while other customers may only engage us to provide appraisal services appraisal outsourcing services are somewhat seasonal in nature to the extent that winter weather conditions reduce the productivity of data collection activities in connection with those projects 

strategy 

our objective is to grow our revenue and earnings internally supplemented by focused strategic acquisitions the key components of our business strategy are to 

 

 

 

 

sales marketing and customers 

we market our products and services through direct sales and marketing personnel located throughout the united states other inhouse marketing staff focuses on addon sales professional services and support 

sales of new systems are typically generated from referrals from other government offices or departments within a county or municipality referrals from other local governments relationships established between sales representatives and county or local officials contacts at trade shows direct mailings and direct contact from prospects already familiar with us we are active in numerous national state county and local government associations and participate in annual meetings trade shows and educational events 

customers consist primarily of county and municipal agencies school districts and other local government offices in counties customers include the auditor treasurer tax assessorcollector county clerk district clerk county and district court judges probation officers sheriff and county appraiser at municipal government sites customers include directors from various departments including administration finance utilities public works code enforcement personnel purchasing taxation municipal court and police contracts for software products and services are generally implemented over periods of three months to one year with annually renewing maintenance and support update agreements thereafter although either the customer or we can terminate these agreements historically almost all support and maintenance agreements are automatically renewed annually contracts for appraisal outsourcing services are generally one to three years in duration during 2006 approximately 38 of our revenue was attributable to ongoing support and maintenance agreements 

competition 

we compete with numerous local regional and national firms that provide or offer some or many of the same products and services that we provide most of these competitors are smaller companies that may be able to offer less expensive solutions than ours many of these firms operate within a specific geographic area andor in a narrow product or service niche we also compete with national firms some of which have greater financial and technical resources than we do including oracle corporation lawson software inc sap ag maximus inc affiliated computer services inc sungard data systems inc new world systems and manatron inc in addition we sometimes compete with consulting and systems integration firms such as bearingpoint inc which develop custom systems primarily for larger governments we also occasionally compete with central internal information service departments of local governments which require us to persuade the enduser department to discontinue service by its own personnel and outsource the service to us we compete on a variety of factors including price service name recognition reputation technological capabilities and the ability to modify existing products and services to accommodate the individual requirements of the customer our ability to offer an integrated system of applications for several offices or departments is often a competitive strength local governmental units often are required to seek competitive proposals through a request for proposal process 

suppliers 

all computers peripherals printers scanners operating system software office automation software and other equipment necessary for the implementation and provision of our software systems and services are presently available from several thirdparty sources hardware is purchased on original equipment manufacturer or distributor terms at discounts from retail we have not experienced any significant supply problems 

backlog 

at december 31 2006 our estimated revenue backlog was approximately 2059 million compared to 1654 million at december 31 2005 the backlog represents signed contracts under which the products have not been delivered or the services have not been performed as of yearend approximately 1503 million of the backlog is expected to be recognized during 2007 

intellectual property proprietary rights and licenses 

we regard certain features of our internal operations software and documentation as confidential and proprietary and rely on a combination of contractual restrictions trade secret laws and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property we generally do not rely on patents we believe that due to the rapid rate of technological change in the computer software industry trade secrets and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as knowledge ability and experience of our employees frequent product enhancements and timeliness and quality of support services we typically license our software products under nonexclusive license agreements which are generally nontransferable and have a perpetual term 

employees 

at december 31 2006 we had approximately 1530 employees appraisal outsourcing projects are cyclical in nature and can be widely dispersed geographically we often hire temporary employees to assist in these projects whose term of employment generally ends with the project’s completion none of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to collective bargaining agreements we consider our relations with our employees to be positive 

internet website and availability of public filings 

we file annual quarterly current and other reports proxy statements and other information with the securities and exchange commission or sec pursuant to the securities exchange act you may read and copy any materials we file with the sec at the sec’s public reference room by calling the sec at 1800sec0330 the sec maintains an internet site that contains reports proxy and other information statements and other information regarding issuers including us that file electronically with the sec the address of this site is httpwwwsecgov

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk investors evaluating our company should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this annual report any of the following factors could materially harm our business operating results and financial condition additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business operating results and financial condition this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report we may make forwardlooking statements from time to time both written and oral we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forwardlooking statements our actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forwardlooking statements due to a number of factors including those set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report 

a decline in information technology spending may result in a decrease in our revenues or lower our growth rate 

a decline in the demand for information technology among our current and prospective customers may result in decreased revenues or a lower growth rate for us because our sales depend in part on our customers’ level of funding for new or additional information technology systems and services moreover demand for our solutions may be reduced by a decline in overall demand for computer software and services accordingly we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase or maintain our revenues 

our products are complex and we run the risk of errors or defects with new product introductions or enhancements 

software products as complex as those developed by us may contain errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released although we have not experienced material adverse effects resulting from any such defects or errors to date we cannot assure you that material defects and errors will not be found after commencement of product shipments any such defects could result in loss of revenues or delay market acceptance 

our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims it is possible however that we may not always be able to negotiate such provisions in our contracts with customers or that the limitation of liability provisions contained in our license agreements may not be effective as a result of existing or future federal state or local laws ordinances or judicial decisions although we maintain errors and omissions and general liability insurance and we try to structure our contracts to include limitations on liability we cannot assure you that a successful claim could not be made or would not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may experience fluctuations in quarterly revenue that could adversely impact our stock price and our operating results 

our actual revenues in a quarter could fall below expectations which could lead to a decline in our stock price our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter revenues from license fees in any quarter depend substantially upon our contracting activity and our ability to recognize revenues in that quarter in accordance with our revenue recognition policies our quarterly revenue may fluctuate and may be difficult to forecast for a variety of reasons including the following 

 

fluctuation in our quarterly revenues may adversely affect our operating results in each fiscal quarter our expense levels operating costs and hiring plans are based on projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed if our actual revenues fall below expectations we could experience a reduction in operating results 

as with other software vendors we may be required to delay revenue recognition into future periods which could adversely impact our operating results 

we have in the past had to and in the future may have to defer revenue recognition for license fees due to several factors including whether 

 

because of the factors listed above and other specific requirements under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states for software revenue recognition we must have very precise terms in our license agreements in order to recognize revenue when we initially deliver and install software or perform services negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions can extend the sales cycle and sometimes we do not obtain terms and conditions that permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery or even as work on the project is completed 

compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 new securities and exchange commission regulations and new york stock exchange rules are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours the costs required to comply with such evolving laws are difficult to predict to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards this investment may result in an unforeseen increase in general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities which may harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins and adversely affect our operating results 

we realize lower margins on software and appraisal service revenues than on license revenue the majority of our contracts include both software licenses and professional services therefore an increase in the percentage of software service and appraisal service revenue compared to license revenue could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and could adversely affect operating results 

selling products and services into the public sector poses unique challenges 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of software and services to state county and city governments other municipal agencies and other public entities we expect that sales to public sector customers will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues in the future we face many risks and challenges associated with contracting with governmental entities including 

 

each of these risks is outside our control if we fail to adequately adapt to these risks and uncertainties our financial performance could be adversely affected 

the open bidding process for governmental contracts creates uncertainty in predicting future contract awards 

many governmental agencies purchase products and services through an open bidding process generally a governmental entity will publish an established list of requirements requesting potential vendors to propose solutions for the established requirements to respond successfully to these requests for proposals we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract the time required to establish operations for the proposed client and the likely terms of any other third party proposals submitted we cannot guarantee that we will win any bids in the future through the request for proposal process or that any winning bids will ultimately result in contracts on favorable terms our failure to secure contracts through the open bidding process or to secure such contracts on favorable terms may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

fixed price contracts may affect our profits 

some of our present contracts are on a fixedpriced basis which can lead to various risks including 

 

if we do not adequately assess these and other risks we may be subject to cost overruns and penalties which may harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

we face significant competition from other vendors and potential new entrants into our markets 

we believe we are a leading provider of integrated solutions for the public sector however we face competition from a variety of software vendors that offer products and services similar to those offered by us as well as from companies offering to develop custom software we compete on the basis of a number of factors including 

 

we believe the market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors that vary in size primary computer platforms and overall product scope our competitors include the consulting divisions of national and regional accounting firms publicly held companies that focus on selected segments of the public sector market and a significant number of smaller privately held companies certain competitors have greater technical marketing and financial resources than we do we cannot assure you that such competitors will not develop products or offer services that are superior to our products or services or that achieve greater market acceptance 

we also compete with internal centralized information service departments of governmental entities which require us to persuade the enduser to stop the internal service and outsource to us in addition our customers may elect in the future to provide information management services internally through new or existing departments which could reduce the market for our services 

we could face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the public sector software application market and new products and technologies are introduced increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share in addition current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with thirdparties thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share further competitive pressures could require us to reduce the price of our software licenses and related services we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the failure to do so would have material adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition 

we must respond to rapid technological changes to be competitive 

the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards in computer hardware and software technology changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result our future success will depend in part upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products and develop and introduce in a timely manner or acquire new products that keep pace with technological developments satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and costeffective manner further we cannot assure you that the products capabilities or technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive if we are unable to develop or acquire on a timely and costeffective basis new software products or enhancements to existing products or if such new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance our business operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

our failure to properly manage growth could adversely affect our business 

we have expanded our operations since february 1998 when we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector we intend to continue expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities this growth places a significant demand on management and operational resources in order to manage growth effectively we must implement and improve our operational systems procedures and controls on a timely basis we must also identify hire train and manage key managerial and technical personnel if we fail to implement these systems or employ and retain such qualified personnel our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to hire integrate and retain qualified personnel 

our continued success will depend upon the availability and performance of our key management sales marketing customer support and product development personnel the loss of key management or technical personnel could adversely affect us we believe that our continued success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract integrate and retain such personnel we have at times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel competition for qualified software development sales and other personnel is intense and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

we may experience difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy 

in addition a significant portion of our growth has resulted from strategic acquisitions in new product and geographic markets although our future focus will be on internal growth we will continue to identify and pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances with suitable candidates our future success will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate future acquisitions and other strategic alliances into our operations acquisitions may involve a number of special risks including diversion of management’s attention failure to retain key acquired personnel unanticipated events or circumstances legal liabilities and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we conduct due diligence reviews of potential acquisition candidates we may not identify all material liabilities or risks related to acquisition candidates there can be no assurance that any such strategic acquisitions or alliances will be accomplished on favorable terms or will result in profitable operations 

we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights 

many of our product and service offerings incorporate proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of contracts copyrights and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology we cannot be certain that we have taken all appropriate steps to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property in addition there has been significant litigation in the united states in recent years involving intellectual property rights we are not currently involved in any material intellectual property litigation we may however be a party to intellectual property litigation in the future to protect our proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights further we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us in the future with respect to current or future products any claims or litigation with or without merit could be timeconsuming and result in costly litigation and diversion of management’s attention further any claims and litigation could cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements such royalty or licensing arrangements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all thus litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations regardless of the final outcome of such litigation 

our application service provider strategy has yet to gain widespread acceptance 

some businesses choose to access enterprise software applications through application service providers or asps which are businesses that host applications and provide access to software on a subscription basis the public sector market for asp solutions is new and unproven acceptance of our asp model depends upon the ability and willingness of different governmental entities to accept and implement asp solutions some prospective clients have expressed security and privacy concerns with the asp model including a concern regarding the confidential nature of the information and transactions available from and conducted with governments and concerns regarding offsite storage of such information we have limited experience selling our solutions through asps and may not be successful in generating revenue from this distribution channel 

changes in the insurance markets may affect our ability to win some contract awards and may lead to increased expenses 

some of our customers primarily those for our property appraisal services require that we secure performance bonds before they will select us as their vendor the number of qualified highrated insurance companies that offer performance bonds has decreased in recent years while the costs associated with securing these bonds has increased dramatically in addition we are generally required to issue a letter of credit as security for the issuance of a performance bond we periodically enter into longterm borrowing agreements and each letter of credit we issue without corresponding cash collateral may reduce our borrowing capacity under the borrowing agreement we cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure such performance bonds in the future on terms that are favorable to us if at all our inability to obtain performance bonds on favorable terms or at all could impact our future ability to win some contract awards particularly large property appraisal services contracts which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

recent volatility in the stock markets increasing shareholder litigation the adoption of expansive legislation that redefines corporate controls in particular legislation adopted to prevent future corporate and accounting scandals as well as other factors have recently led to significant increases in premiums for directors’ and officers’ liability insurance the number of insurers offering directors and officers insurance at competitive rates has also decreased in recent years volatility of the insurance market may result in future increases in our general and administrative expenses which may adversely affect future operating results 

our stock price may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and may be significantly affected by many different factors some examples of factors that can have a significant impact on our stock price include 

 

in addition the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for the common stock of technology companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company we cannot assure you that similar litigation will not occur in the future with respect to us such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition 

historically we have not paid dividends on our common stock 

we have not declared or paid a cash dividend since we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector in february 1998 additionally we may enter into credit agreements that could restrict our ability to pay cash dividends we intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law could deter takeover attempts 

our board of directors may issue up to 1000000 shares of preferred stock and may determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting and conversion rights of these shares of preferred stock these determinations may be made without any further vote or action by our stockholders the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock in addition some provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and of the delaware general corporation law could also delay prevent or make more difficult a merger tender offer or proxy contest involving us 

financial outlook 

from time to time in press releases and otherwise we may publish forecasts or other forwardlooking statements regarding our results including estimated revenues or net earnings any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties and as a matter of course any number of them may prove to be incorrect further the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors including those described in this discussion many of which are beyond our control as a result we cannot be certain that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse current and potential stockholders are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions but instead are encouraged to utilize our entire publicly available mix of historical and forwardlooking information as well as other available information regarding us our products and services and the software industry when evaluating our prospective results of operations

we monitor and analyze several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance these indicators include the following 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements the reported amounts of revenues cost of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the notes to the consolidated financial statements included as part of this annual report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including but not limited to those related to intangible assets bad debts and our service contracts we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of statement of position “sop” 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended by sop 984 and sop 989 as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants and in accordance with the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” we recognize revenue on our appraisal services contracts using the proportionate performance method of accounting with considerations for the provisions of emerging issue task force no 0021 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” our revenues are derived from sale of software licenses appraisal services maintenance and support and services that typically range from installation training and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs for multiple element software arrangements which do not entail the performance of services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software we generally record revenue when the delivered products or performed services result in a legally enforceable and nonrefundable claim we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized because most of our customers are governmental entities we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments in a limited number of cases we encounter a customer who is dissatisfied with some aspect of the software product or our service and we may offer a “concession” to such customer in those limited situations where we grant a concession we rarely reduce the contract arrangement fee but alternatively may perform additional services such as additional training or programming a minor feature the customer had in their prior software solution these amounts have historically been considered nominal in connection with our customer contracts and the adequacy of related allowances and measures of progress towards contract completion our project managers are charged with the responsibility to continually review the status of each customer on a specific contract basis also we review on at least a quarterly basis significant past due accounts receivable and the adequacy of related reserves events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments may require revision include but are not limited to deterioration of a customer’s financial condition failure to manage our customer’s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products 

for those software arrangements that involve significant production modification or customization of the software which is considered essential to its functionality and for substantially all real estate appraisal outsourcing projects we recognize revenue and profit as the work progresses using the percentageofcompletion method and the proportionate performance method of revenue recognition these methods rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue billings and collections and expected contract costs as well as measures of progress toward completion we believe reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs and progress applicable to various stages of a contract can be made at times we perform additional andor noncontractual services for little to no incremental fee to satisfy customer expectations if changes occur in delivery productivity or other factors used in developing our 

estimates of expected costs or revenues we revise our cost and revenue estimates and any revisions are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision first become known 

we use contract accounting primarily the percentageofcompletion method and apply the provisions of sop no 811 “accounting for performance of construction — type and certain production — type contracts” for those software arrangements that involve significant production modification or customization of the software or where our software services are otherwise considered essential to the functionality of the software in addition we recognize revenue using the proportionate performance method of revenue recognition for our property appraisal projects some of which can range up to three years in connection with these and certain other contracts we may perform the work prior to when the services are billable andor payable pursuant to the contract the termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the fair value of products delivered and services performed in the event of an early termination 

in connection with certain of our contracts we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet date many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period management reviews unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue in addition we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue which represents billings in excess of revenue earned the majority of this liability consists of maintenance billings in which payments are made in advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the maintenance period generally one year we also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit and the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product has not been met on a periodic basis we review by customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains appropriate 

intangible assets and goodwill  our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge the cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value with the excess allocated to goodwill accordingly we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets including software customer related intangibles trade name and goodwill in addition we capitalize software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility these intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives all intangible assets with definite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of goodwill is generally measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its fair value generally determined by estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset recoverability of other intangible assets is generally measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows the assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include but are not limited to a significant decrease in the market value of the business or asset acquired a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the business or asset acquired is used or a significant adverse change in the business climate in addition products capabilities or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or noncompetitive 

sharebased compensation we have a stock option plan that provides for the grant of stock options to key employees directors and nonemployee consultants prior to january 1 2006 we accounted for sharebased compensation utilizing the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion “apb” no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations accordingly no compensation expense was recorded because the exercise prices of the stock options equaled the market prices of the underlying stock on the dates of grants however prior to adoption of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r sharebased compensation had been included in pro forma disclosures in the financial statement footnotes for periods prior to 2006 

effective january 1 2006 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” which establishes accounting for sharebased awards exchanged for employee services using the modified prospective application transition method subsequently we recorded compensation expense in our statement of operations over the service period that the awards are expected to vest compensation cost recognized in 2006 includes the applicable amounts of a compensation cost of all sharebased payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of january 1 2006 based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” and previously presented in the pro forma footnote disclosures and b compensation cost for all sharebased payments granted subsequent to january 1 2006 based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the new provisions of sfas no 123r 

we estimate the fair value of sharebased awards on the date of grant using the blackscholes option valuation model sharebased compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures which will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from such estimates changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data we estimate stock price volatility at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock estimated option life is determined using the “simplified method” in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 107 determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates 

analysis of results of operations and other 

the following discussion compares the historical results of operations on a basis consistent with gaap for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 

2006 compared to 2005 

revenues 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our revenues for the following years ended december 31 

 

software licenses  changes in software license revenues consist of the following components 

 

software services  changes in software services revenues consist of the following components 

 

 

maintenance  we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and third party software maintenance revenues increased due to growth in our installed customer base as evidenced by our software license revenue and slightly higher maintenance rates on most of our product lines 

appraisal services the appraisal services business is driven in part by revaluation cycles in various states appraisal services revenue increased over the prior year mainly due to activity related to ohio’s revaluation cycle which occurs every six years as well as the addition of new customers the ohio revaluation cycle was nearly complete by the end of 2006 the level of appraisal services revenues in 2007 will depend on our ability to replace appraisal services revenues associated with the ohio revaluation 

cost of revenues and gross margins 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues and those components stated as a percentage of related revenues for the following years ended december 31 

 

the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the periods presented for the following years ended december 31 

 

cost of software license revenues our software license gross margin percentage in 2006 increased due to substantially higher software license revenues and slightly lower amortization expense of software development costs as some products became fully amortized during the first quarter of 2006 approximately half of our cost of software license revenues is amortization expense for capitalized development costs on certain software products with the remainder consisting of costs related to thirdparty software 

amortization costs are fixed in nature and do not change with revenue changes once a product is released we begin to amortize over the estimated useful life of the product the costs associated with its development amortization expense is determined on a productbyproduct basis at an annual rate not less than straightline basis over the product’s estimated life which is generally five years development costs consist mainly of personnel costs such as salary and benefits paid to our developers and rent for related office space 

cost of software services and maintenance revenues the software services and maintenance gross margin percentage in 2006 was comparable to the 2005 the cost of software services and maintenance increased because we added to our implementation and support staff to increase our capacity to support new sales growth and deliver sales backlog cost of software services and maintenance primarily consists of expenses such as personnel costs related to installation of our software licenses conversion of customer data training customer personnel and support activities and various other services such as asp and disaster recovery 

cost of appraisal services revenues the appraisal services gross margin percentage increased in 2006 compared to 2005 mainly due to significant organizational changes and headcount reductions we made in the second quarter of 2005 to our appraisal services business to bring costs in line with expected levels of revenue in addition margins in 2005 were negatively affected by cost inefficiencies associated with one large contract 

the overall gross margin percentage rose mainly due to a revenue mix that included more software license revenues as well as lower costs as a result of the restructuring of our appraisal services business in the second quarter of 2005 software license revenue inherently has higher gross margins than other revenues such as software services and hardware 

selling general and administrative expenses 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our selling general and administrative “sga” expenses for the following years ended december 31 

 

in 2006 sga includes a noncash purchased inprocess research and development charge of 140000 relating to one of our acquisitions in january 2006 and 20 million of noncash sharebased compensation expense as a result of implementing sfas no 123r in january 2006 partially offsetting these charges were lower sga expenses relating to our appraisal services and appraisal and tax software businesses due to the restructuring of those businesses in the second quarter of 2005 

restructuring charge 

because of unsatisfactory financial performance early in 2005 we made significant organizational changes in the second quarter of 2005 to those areas of our business that were not performing to our expectations our goal was to bring costs in line with expected levels of revenue while improving the efficiency of our organizational structure to ensure that clients continue to receive superior service 

we reorganized the appraisal services business to eliminate levels of management and reduce overhead expense we also took actions to reduce headcount and costs in our appraisal and tax software division and we consolidated certain senior management positions at the corporate office these cost reductions were made in the second quarter of 2005 as a result we eliminated approximately 120 positions including management staff and projectrelated personnel 

in connection with the reorganization we incurred certain charges which were primarily comprised of employee severance costs and related fringe benefits and totaled approximately 13 million before income taxes the related payments were paid in 2005 

amortization of customer and trade name intangibles 

acquisition intangibles are composed of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that is allocated to acquired and amortizable software customer and trade name intangibles with the remainder allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization however amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues while amortization expense of customer and trade name intangibles is recorded as other expense the estimated useful lives of both customer and trade name intangibles are 5 to 25 years the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the following years ended december 31 

 

estimated annual amortization expense relating to customer and trade name acquisition intangibles excluding acquired software for which the amortization expense is recorded as cost of revenues for the next five years is as follows in thousands 

 

other 

interest income is the main component of other income which also includes nonusage and other fees associated with a credit agreement we terminated in january 2007 gain on sale of certain assets gains and losses on risk management liabilities and assets associated with a foreign exchange contract and miscellaneous other items interest income in 2006 was 14 million compared to 900000 in 2005 

income tax provision 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the following years ended december 31 

 

the effective income tax rates were different from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of 35 primarily due to state income taxes the qualified manufacturing activities deduction and nondeductible meals and entertainment costs in 2006 the rate is also impacted by nondeductible sharebased compensation expense 

 

slightly more than half of our stock option awards granted qualify as incentive stock options “iso” for income tax purposes as such a tax benefit is not recorded at the time the compensation cost related to the options is recorded for book purposes due to the fact that an iso does not ordinarily result in a tax benefit unless there is a disqualifying disposition stock option grants of nonqualified options result in the creation of a deferred tax asset which is a temporary difference until the time that the option is exercised due to the treatment of incentive stock options for tax purposes our effective tax rate from year to year is subject to variability 

2005 compared to 2004 

revenues 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our revenues for the following years ended december 31 

 

software licenses  changes in software license revenues consist of the following components 

 

software services  changes in software services revenues consist of the following components 

 

maintenance  we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and third party software maintenance revenues increased due to growth in our installed customer base as evidenced by our software license revenue and slightly higher maintenance rates on most of our product lines 

appraisal services the decrease in appraisal services revenues is due to the completion in 2004 of certain significant appraisal contracts these larger projects are often relatively discretionary in nature compared to smaller projects which tend to occur on a more consistent basis and the larger projects we recently completed have not been replaced by similar projects the appraisal services business is driven in part by revaluation cycles in various states 

cost of revenues and gross margins 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues and those components stated as a percentage of related revenues for the following years ended december 31 

 

 

 

cost of software license revenues amortization expense for capitalized software products declined from 61 million in 2004 to 59 million in 2005 because certain software products became fully amortized during 2005 which offset new amortization expense from software products released in 2004 

cost of acquired software in 2005 cost of acquired software declined compared to the prior year because certain acquired software assets recorded for previous acquisitions became fully amortized 

cost of software services and maintenance revenues in 2005 cost of software services and maintenance grew 11 while the related software services and maintenance revenues increased 8 compared to the prior year period during 2005 costs increased at a faster rate than related software services and maintenance revenues which reflects lower utilization of personnel in our appraisal and tax software division costs to support our recently released orion products a shift in the roles of certain of our development personnel whose costs were capitalized in 2004 to projects that were expensed in 2005 and higher health care costs 

cost of appraisal services revenues the decline in the cost of appraisal services revenues is the result of lower appraisal services revenues we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects whose term of employment generally ends with the projects’ completion in addition in the second quarter of 2005 we made significant organizational changes to our appraisal services division because of the declining gross margins 

gross margin percentage the overall gross margin percentage decline was due to cost inefficiencies associated with lower appraisal services revenues and efforts and costs to support our recently released orion products as well as a shift in the roles of certain of our development personnel whose costs were capitalized in 2004 to projects that are being expensed in 2005 and higher health care costs 

selling general and administrative expenses 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our selling general and administrative “sga” expenses for the following years ended december 31 

 

sga increased mainly due to higher health care costs and an increase in the number of marketing personnel these increases were offset somewhat by lower consulting fees associated with documenting our internal control processes 

other 

interest income is the main component of other income which also includes nonusage and other fees associated with a credit agreement we terminated in january 2007 gain on sale of certain assets gain on risk management assets associated with a foreign exchange contract and miscellaneous other items other income increased compared to 2004 mainly due to higher interest rates and a small gain on sale of certain assets 

income tax provision 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the following years ended december 31 

 

the effective income tax rate declined 2 from 2004 due to the qualified manufacturing activities deduction enacted in 2005 and a corporate reorganization in 2005 which favorably impacted our state income tax provision 

financial condition and liquidity 

historically we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily with cash generated from operating activities as of december 31 2006 our combined cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments including restricted cash equivalents and a restricted certificate of deposit balance was 417 million compared to 375 million at december 31 2005 cash provided by operating activities was 268 million in 2006 compared to 212 million in 2005 and 222 million in 2004 cash and shortterm investments increased primarily due to continued strong operating performance and higher deferred revenue due to additional maintenance customers and new contract signings 

at december 31 2006 our days sales outstanding “dsos” were 102 days compared to dsos of 101 days at december 31 2005 dsos are calculated based on accounts receivable excluding longterm receivables divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by 360 days 

investing activities used cash of 243 million in 2006 while investing activities provided cash of 18 million in 2005 and used cash of 99 million in 2004 in january 2006 we acquired two companies mazikusa inc and tacs inc the combined purchase price including transaction costs for the two companies was approximately 146 million comprised of approximately 117 million in cash and 325000 shares of tyler common stock in september 2006 we also purchased certain maintenance and support agreements associated with one of our financial products for approximately 580000 other investing activities during 2006 were capital expenditures of 43 million including 41 million for computer hardware and purchased software for internal use including a new enterprisewide customer relationship management system and other asset additions to support internal growth in 2005 and 2004 investing activities primarily consisted of investments in software development and property and equipment investing activities in 2004 also included adjustments to the acquisition of eden systems inc “eden” pursuant to our purchase 

agreement two of the shareholders of eden were granted the right to “put” their remaining shares to tyler and we were also granted the right to “call” the remaining shares in 2004 we purchased the remaining 2500 shares for 725000 in cash 

we purchased 268 million of shortterm investments during 2006 proceeds from sales of shortterm investments were 190 million during 2006 during 2006 the shortterm investments earned interest income of 438000 which was reinvested we also earned interest income of 962000 from money market investments and a restricted certificate of deposit 

financing activities used cash of 60 million in 2006 compared to 148 million in 2005 and 99 million in 2004 cash used in financing activities was primarily comprised of purchases of treasury shares net of proceeds from stock option exercises and contributions from our employee stock purchase plan 

during 2006 we purchased approximately 10 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cash purchase price of 105 million 

in 2006 we received 29 million from the exercise of options to purchase approximately 623000 shares of our common stock under our employee stock option plan during 2005 we issued 436000 shares of common stock and received 18 million in aggregate proceeds upon exercise of stock options and during 2004 we issued 680000 shares of common stock and received 19 million in aggregate proceeds upon exercise of stock options 

in both 2006 and 2005 we received 10 million for contributions to the tyler technologies inc employee stock purchase plan “espp” the espp was adopted by our shareholders in may 2004 

subsequent to december 31 2006 and through february 23 2007 we purchased approximately 188000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate cash purchase price of 26 million 

we maintain a 100 million letter of credit facility under which the bank will issue cash collateralized letters of credit as of december 31 2006 we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 50 million to secure surety bonds required by some of our customer contracts 

in the first quarter of 2007 we acquired two small companies and a building for a combined cash purchase price of 50 million we have not finalized the allocation of the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired companies but expect this allocation will result in noncash charges that may have a small dilutive effect on earnings per share in 2007 

excluding acquisitions we anticipate that 2007 capital spending will be between 35 million and 40 million the majority of which will be related to computer equipment and software for infrastructure expansions we currently do not expect to capitalize significant amounts related to software development in 2007 but the actual amount and timing of those costs and whether they are capitalized or expensed may result in additional capitalized software development capital spending in 2007 is expected to be funded from existing cash balances and cash flows from operations 

from time to time we engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates in order to pursue such opportunities which could require significant commitments of capital we may be required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive securities in the future no assurance can be given as to our future acquisition opportunities and how such opportunities will be financed in the absence of future acquisitions of other businesses we believe our current cash balances and expected future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital capital expenditures and other activities through the next twelve months if operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our needs we believe that credit would be available to us 

we lease office facilities as well as transportation computer and other equipment used in our operations under noncancelable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through 2013 most leases contain renewal options and some contain purchase options following are the future obligations under noncancelable leases at december 31 2006 in thousands 

 

it is not our usual business practice to enter into offbalance sheet arrangements or to issue guarantees to third parties as of december 31 2006 we have no material purchase commitments except for the operating lease commitments listed above 

capitalization 

at december 31 2006 our capitalization consisted of 1259 million of shareholders’ equity 

new accounting pronouncements 

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions as defined fin 48 seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 we do not expect the interpretation will have a material impact on our results from operations or financial position 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 with earlier application encouraged any amounts recognized upon adoption as a cumulative effect adjustment will be recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption we have not yet determined the impact of sfas no 157 on our financial condition and results of operations 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial market prices and interest rates as of december 31 2006 we had funds invested in auction rate municipal securities and state and municipal bonds which we accounted for in accordance with sfas no 115 “accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities” these investments were treated as availableforsale under sfas no 115 the carrying value of these investments approximates fair market value due to the nature of this investment we are not subject to significant market rate risk 

we have no outstanding debt at december 31 2006 and we therefore are not subject to any interest rate risk 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures — our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in securities exchange act rules 13a15e as of december 31 2006 based on such evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that as of december 31 2006 such disclosure controls and procedures were effective and designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the securities exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure

description of business 

tyler technologies inc “tyler” is a major provider of integrated information management solutions and services for local governments we partner with clients to make local government more accessible to the public more responsive to the needs of citizens and more efficient in its operations we have a broad line of software products and services to address the information technology “it” needs of virtually every major area of operation for cities counties schools and other local government entities most of our customers have our software installed inhouse for customers who prefer not to physically acquire the software and hardware we provide outsourced hosting for some of our applications at one of our data centers through an applications service provider “asp” arrangement we provide professional it services to our customers including software and hardware installation data conversion training and at times product modifications in addition we are the nation’s largest provider of outsourced property appraisal services for taxing jurisdictions we also provide continuing customer support services to ensure proper product performance and reliability which provides us with longterm customer relationships and a significant base of recurring maintenance revenue 

tyler was founded in 1966 prior to 1998 we operated as a diversified industrial conglomerate with operations in various industrial retail and distribution businesses all of which have been sold or otherwise disposed in 1997 we embarked on a multiphase growth plan focused on serving the specialized information management needs of local governments nationwide in 1998 and 1999 we made a series of strategic acquisitions of companies in the local government it market 

in addition to our continuing operations in the software and services business described above we also operated from 1998 through 2000 a business segment focused on providing outsourced property records management for local governments and reselling related data in late 2000 we decided to dispose of the information and property records services segment in order to strengthen our balance sheet and allow us to focus our resources on the segment of business that we believe offers the greatest growth and profit opportunities we expect to continue to capitalize on these opportunities by leveraging our large national client base our longterm relationships with local government customers and our deep domain expertise in local government operations through the development of stateoftheart technologies and new nationally branded applications solutions we have developed new generation software products some of which are based on ntier architecture sqlcompliant databases browser compatibility and componentbased technology 

market overview 

the state and local government market is one of the largest and most decentralized it markets in the country consisting of all 50 states approximately 3100 counties 36000 cities and towns and 14500 school districts this market is also comprised of approximately 35000 special districts and other agencies each with specialized delegated responsibilities and unique information management requirements 

traditionally local government bodies and agencies performed statemandated duties including property assessment record keeping road maintenance law enforcement administration of election and judicial functions and the provision of welfare assistance today a host of emerging and urgent issues are confronting local governments each of which demands a service response these areas include criminal justice and corrections administration and finance public safety health and human services and public works transfers of responsibility from the federal and state governments to county and municipal governments and agencies in these and other areas also place additional service and financial requirements on these local government units in addition constituents of local governments are increasingly demanding improved service and better access to information from public entities as a result local governments recognize the increasing value of information management systems and services to among other things improve revenue collection provide increased access to information and streamline delivery of services to their constituents local government bodies are now recognizing that “egovernment” is an additional responsibility for community development from integrated tax systems to integrated civil and criminal justice information systems many counties and cities have benefited significantly from the implementation of jurisdictionwide systems that allow different agencies or government offices to share data and provide a more comprehensive approach to information management many city and county governmental agencies also have unique individual information management requirements which must be tailored to the specific functions of each particular office 

many local governments also have difficulties attracting and retaining the staff necessary to support their it functions as a result they seek to establish longterm relationships with reliable providers of high quality it products and services such as tyler 

although local governments generally face budgetary constraints in their operations their primary revenue sources are usually property taxes and to a lesser extent utility fees which tend to be relatively stable in addition the acquisition of new technology typically enables local governments to operate more efficiently and often provides a measurable return on investment that justifies the purchase of software and related services 

gartner estimates that state and local government spending for software and it services will grow from 442 billion in 2005 to 550 billion in 2008 with local government accounting for 217 billion of it spending in 2005 and 269 billion in 2008 the external services and software segments of the market where our business is primarily focused are expected to be the most rapidly growing areas of the local government it market expanding from 109 billion in 2005 to 135 billion in 2008 

products and services 

we provide a comprehensive and flexible suite of products and services that address the information technology needs of cities counties schools and other local government entities we derive our revenues from four primary sources 

 

we design develop and market a broad range of software products to serve missioncritical “backoffice” functions of local governments our software applications are designed primarily for use on hardware supporting unixnt operating systems many of our software applications include internetaccessible solutions that allow for realtime public access to a variety of information or that allow the public to transact business with local governments via the internet our software products and services are generally grouped in four major product areas 

 

each of our core software systems consists of several fully integrated application modules for customers who acquire the software for use inhouse we generally license our systems under standard license agreements that provide the customer with a fully paid nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software in some of the product areas such as financials and property appraisal we offer multiple solutions designed to meet the needs of different sized governments 

we also offer certain software products on an outsourced basis for customers who do not wish to maintain update and operate these systems or to make large upfront capital expenditures to implement these advanced technologies for these customers we either host the applications and data at one of our data centers or maintain the hardware and software at the client’s site customers typically pay monthly fees under multiyear contracts for these services 

historically we have had a greater proportion of our annual revenues in the second half of our fiscal year due to governmental budget and spending cycles and the timing of system implementations for customers desiring to “go live” at the beginning of the calendar year 

a description of our suite of products and services follows

property appraisal and tax 

we provide systems and software that automate the appraisal and assessment of real and personal property including record keeping mass appraisal inquiry and protest tracking appraisal and tax roll generation tax statement processing and electronic statelevel reporting these systems are image and videoenabled to facilitate the storage of and access to the many propertyrelated documents and for the online storage of digital photographs of properties for use in defending values in protest situations other related tax applications are available for agencies that bill and collect taxes including cities counties school tax offices and special taxing and collection agencies these systems support billing collections lock box operations mortgage company electronic payments and various reporting requirements

document management 

we offer a number of specialized applications designed to help county governments enhance and automate courthouse operations these systems record and index information for the many documents maintained at the courthouse such as deeds mortgages liens ucc financing statements and vital records birth death and marriage certificates 

software services 

we provide a variety of professional it services to customers who utilize our software products virtually all of our customers contract with us for installation training and data conversion services in connection with their purchase of tyler’s software products the complete implementation process for a typical system includes planning design data conversion setup and testing at the culmination of the implementation process an installation team travels to the customer’s facility to ensure the smooth transfer of data to the new system installation fees are charged separately to customers on either a fixedfee or hourly charge basis depending on the contract with full passthrough to customers of travel and other outofpocket expenses 

both in connection with the installation of new systems and on an ongoing basis we provide extensive training services and programs related to our products and services training can be provided in our training centers onsite at customers’ locations or at meetings and conferences and can be customized to meet customers’ requirements the vast majority of our customers contract with us for training services both to improve their employees’ proficiency and productivity and to fully utilize the functionality of our systems training services are generally billed on an hourly basis along with travel and other expenses 

maintenance and support 

following the implementation of our software systems we provide ongoing software support services to assist our customers in operating the systems and to periodically update the software support is provided over the phone to customers through help desks staffed by our customer support representatives for more complicated issues our staff with the customers’ permission can log on to customers’ systems remotely we maintain our customers’ software largely through releases that contain improvements and incremental additions along with updates necessary because of legislative or regulatory changes 

virtually all of our software customers contract with us for maintenance and support which provides us with a significant source of recurring revenue we generally provide maintenance and support under annual contracts with a typical fee based on a percentage of the software product’s license fee these fees can be increased annually and may also increase as new license fees increase maintenance and support fees are generally paid in advance for the entire maintenance contract period most maintenance contracts automatically renew unless the customer or tyler gives notice of termination prior to expiration similar support is provided to our asp customers and is included in their overall monthly fees 

appraisal services 

we are the nation’s largest provider of property appraisal outsourcing services for local government taxing authorities these services include 

 

local government taxing entities normally reappraise properties from time to time to update values for tax assessment purposes and to maintain equity in the taxing process in some jurisdictions reassessment cycles are mandated by law in others they are discretionary while some taxing jurisdictions perform reappraisals inhouse many local governments outsource this function because of its cyclical nature and because of the specialized knowledge and expertise requirements associated with it our business unit that provides appraisal outsourcing services to local governments has been in this business since 1938 

in some instances we also sell property tax andor appraisal software products in connection with appraisal outsourcing projects while other customers may only engage us to provide appraisal services appraisal outsourcing services are somewhat seasonal in nature to the extent that winter weather conditions reduce the productivity of data collection activities in connection with those projects 

in the second quarter of 2005 we reorganized our appraisal services business to better align the organization and cost structure with the expected revenue levels as part of the reorganization we eliminated approximately 120 positions and recorded a pretax charge of 13 million for related employee severance costs 

strategy 

our objective is to grow our revenue and earnings internally supplemented by focused strategic acquisitions the key components of our business strategy are to 

 

 

 

when considering acquisition opportunities we generally focus on companies with strong management teams and employee bases and excellent customer relationships in january 2006 we acquired two companies whose products will be included within our financials division mazikusa inc offers a student information system for k12 schools which manages such applications as scheduling grades and attendance tacs inc offers software products to manage public sector pension funds these acquisitions added products that were not previously a part of tyler’s portfolio in december 2003 we acquired eden systems inc “eden” a provider of financial personnel and citizen services systems for local governments in december 2003 we also acquired certain assets of a business that provides forms software to users of some of our software products prior to these acquisitions our most recent acquisition included in our continuing operations was completed in november 1999 

sales marketing and customers 

we market our products and services through direct sales and marketing personnel located throughout the united states other inhouse marketing staff focuses on addon sales professional services and support 

sales of new systems are typically generated from referrals from other government offices or departments within a county or municipality referrals from other local governments relationships established between sales representatives and county or local officials contacts at trade shows direct mailings and direct contact from prospects already familiar with us we are active in numerous national state county and local government associations and participate in annual meetings trade shows and educational events 

customers consist primarily of county and municipal agencies school districts and other local government offices in counties customers include the auditor treasurer tax assessorcollector county clerk district clerk county and district court judges probation officers sheriff and county appraiser at municipal government sites customers include directors from various departments including administration finance utilities public works code enforcement personnel purchasing taxation municipal court and police contracts for software products and services are generally implemented over periods of three months to one year with annually renewing maintenance and support update agreements thereafter although either the customer or we can terminate these agreements historically almost all support and maintenance agreements are automatically renewed annually contracts for appraisal outsourcing services are generally one to three years in duration during 2005 approximately 38 of our revenue was attributable to ongoing support and maintenance agreements 

competition 

we compete with numerous local regional and national firms that provide or offer some or many of the same products and services that we provide most of these competitors are smaller companies that may be able to offer less expensive solutions than ours many of these firms operate within a specific geographic area andor in a narrow product or service niche we also compete with national firms some of which have greater financial and technical resources than we do including oracle corporation lawson software inc sap ag maximus inc affiliated computer services inc sungard data systems inc new world systems and manatron inc in addition we sometimes compete with consulting and systems integration firms such as bearingpoint inc and accenture ltd which develop custom systems primarily for larger governments we also occasionally compete with central internal information service departments of local governments which require us to persuade the enduser department to discontinue service by its own personnel and outsource the service to us we compete on a variety of factors including price service name recognition reputation technological capabilities and the ability to modify existing products and services to accommodate the individual requirements of the customer our ability to offer an integrated system of applications for several offices or departments is often a competitive strength local governmental units often are required to seek competitive proposals through a request for proposal process 

suppliers 

all computers peripherals printers scanners operating system software office automation software and other equipment necessary for the implementation and provision of our software systems and services are presently available from several thirdparty sources hardware is purchased on original equipment manufacturer or distributor terms at discounts from retail we have not experienced any significant supply problems 

backlog 

at december 31 2005 our estimated sales backlog was approximately 1654 million compared to 1422 million at december 31 2004 the backlog represents signed contracts under which the products have not been delivered or the services have not been performed as of yearend approximately 1305 million of the backlog is expected to be installed or services are expected to be performed during 2006 

intellectual property proprietary rights and licenses 

we regard certain features of our internal operations software and documentation as confidential and proprietary and rely on a combination of contractual restrictions trade secret laws and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property we generally do not rely on patents we believe that due to the rapid rate of technological change in the computer software industry trade secrets and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as knowledge ability and experience of our employees frequent product enhancements and timeliness and quality of support services we typically license our software products under nonexclusive license agreements which are generally nontransferable and have a perpetual term 

employees 

at december 31 2005 we had approximately 1360 employees appraisal outsourcing projects are cyclical in nature and can be widely dispersed geographically we often hire temporary employees to assist in these projects whose term of employment generally ends with the project’s completion none of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to collective bargaining agreements we consider our relations with our employees to be positive 

internet website and availability of public filings 

we file annual quarterly current and other reports proxy statements and other information with the securities and exchange commission or sec pursuant to the securities exchange act you may read and copy any materials we file with the sec at the sec’s public reference room by calling the sec at 1800sec0330 the sec maintains an internet site that contains reports proxy and other information statements and other information regarding issuers including us that file electronically with the sec the address of site is httpwwwsecgov

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk investors evaluating our company should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this annual report any of the following factors could materially harm our business operating results and financial condition additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business operating results and financial condition this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report we may make forwardlooking statements from time to time both written and oral we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forwardlooking statements our actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forwardlooking statements due to a number of factors including those set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report 

a decline in information technology spending may result in a decrease in our revenues or lower our growth rate 

a decline in the demand for information technology among our current and prospective customers may result in decreased revenues or a lower growth rate for us because our sales depend in part on our customers’ level of funding for new or additional information technology systems and services moreover demand for our solutions may be reduced by a decline in overall demand for computer software and services accordingly we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase or maintain our revenues 

we may experience fluctuations in quarterly revenue that could adversely impact our stock price and our operating results 

our actual revenues in a quarter could fall below expectations which could lead to a decline in our stock price our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter revenues from license fees in any quarter depend substantially upon our contracting activity and our ability to recognize revenues in that quarter in accordance with our revenue recognition policies our quarterly revenue may fluctuate and may be difficult to forecast for a variety of reasons including the following 

 

 

fluctuation in our quarterly revenues may adversely affect our operating results in each fiscal quarter our expense levels operating costs and hiring plans are based on projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed if our actual revenues fall below expectations we could experience a reduction in operating results 

as with other software vendors we may be required to delay revenue recognition into future periods which could adversely impact our operating results 

we have in the past had to and in the future may have to defer revenue recognition for license fees due to several factors including whether 

 

because of the factors listed above and other specific requirements under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states for software revenue recognition we must have very precise terms in our license agreements in order to recognize revenue when we initially deliver and install software or perform services negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions can extend the sales cycle and sometimes we do not obtain terms and conditions that permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery or even as work on the project is completed 

compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 new securities and exchange commission regulations and new york stock exchange rules are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours the costs required to comply with such evolving laws are difficult to predict to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards this investment may result in an unforeseen increase in general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities which may harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins and adversely affect our operating results 

we realize lower margins on software and appraisal service revenues than on license revenue the majority of our contracts include both software licenses and professional services therefore an increase in the percentage of software service and appraisal service revenue compared to license revenue could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and could adversely affect operating results 

selling products and services into the public sector poses unique challenges 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of software and services to state county and city governments other municipal agencies and other public entities we expect that sales to public sector customers will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues in the future we face many risks and challenges associated with contracting with governmental entities including 

 

each of these risks is outside our control if we fail to adequately adapt to these risks and uncertainties our financial performance could be adversely affected 

the open bidding process for governmental contracts creates uncertainty in predicting future contract awards 

many governmental agencies purchase products and services through an open bidding process generally a governmental entity will publish an established list of requirements requesting potential vendors to propose solutions for the established requirements to respond successfully to these requests for proposals we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract the time required to establish operations for the proposed client and the likely terms of any other third party proposals submitted we cannot guarantee that we will win any bids in the future through the request for proposal process or that any winning bids will ultimately result in contracts on favorable terms our failure to secure contracts through the open bidding process or to secure such contracts on favorable terms may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

fixedprice contracts may affect our profits 

some of our present contracts are on a fixedpriced basis which can lead to various risks including 

 

if we do not adequately assess these and other risks we may be subject to cost overruns and penalties which may harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

we face significant competition from other vendors and potential new entrants into our markets 

we believe we are a leading provider of integrated solutions for the public sector however we face competition from a variety of software vendors that offer products and services similar to those offered by us as well as from companies offering to develop custom software we compete on the basis of a number of factors including 

 

 

we believe the market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors that vary in size primary computer platforms and overall product scope our competitors include the consulting divisions of national and regional accounting firms publicly held companies that focus on selected segments of the public sector market and a significant number of smaller privately held companies certain competitors have greater technical marketing and financial resources than we do we cannot assure you that such competitors will not develop products or offer services that are superior to our products or services or that achieve greater market acceptance 

we also compete with internal centralized information service departments of governmental entities which requires us to persuade the enduser to stop the internal service and outsource to us in addition our customers may elect in the future to provide information management services internally through new or existing departments which could reduce the market for our services 

we could face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the public sector software application market and new products and technologies are introduced increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share in addition current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with thirdparties thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share further competitive pressures could require us to reduce the price of our software licenses and related services we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the failure to do so would have material adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition 

we must respond to rapid technological changes to be competitive 

the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards in computer hardware and software technology changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result our future success will depend in part upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products and develop and introduce in a timely manner or acquire new products that keep pace with technological developments satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and costeffective manner further we cannot assure you that the products capabilities or technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive if we are unable to develop or acquire on a timely and costeffective basis new software products or enhancements to existing products or if such new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance our business operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

our failure to properly manage growth could adversely affect our business 

we have expanded our operations since february 1998 when we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector we intend to continue expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities this growth places a significant demand on management and operational resources in order to manage growth effectively we must implement and improve our operational systems procedures and controls on a timely basis we must also identify hire train and manage key managerial and technical personnel if we fail to implement these systems or employ and retain such qualified personnel our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to hire integrate and retain qualified personnel 

our continued success will depend upon the availability and performance of our key management sales marketing customer support and product development personnel the loss of key management or technical personnel could adversely affect us we believe that our continued success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract integrate and retain such personnel we have at times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel competition for qualified software development sales and other personnel is intense and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

we may experience difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy 

in addition a significant portion of our growth has resulted from strategic acquisitions in new product and geographic markets although our future focus will be on internal growth we will continue to identify and pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances with suitable candidates our future success will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate future acquisitions and other strategic alliances into our operations acquisitions may involve a number of special risks including diversion of management’s attention failure to retain key acquired personnel unanticipated events or circumstances legal liabilities and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we conduct due diligence reviews of potential acquisition candidates we may not identify all material liabilities or risks related to acquisition candidates there can be no assurance that any such strategic acquisitions or alliances will be accomplished on favorable terms or will result in profitable operations 

we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights 

many of our product and service offerings incorporate proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of contracts copyrights and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology we cannot be certain that we have taken all appropriate steps to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property in addition there has been significant litigation in the united states in recent years involving intellectual property rights we are not currently involved in any material intellectual property litigation we may however be a party to intellectual property litigation in the future to protect our proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights further we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us in the future with respect to current or future products any claims or litigation with or without merit could be timeconsuming and result in costly litigation and diversion of management’s attention further any claims and litigation could cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements such royalty or licensing arrangements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all thus litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations regardless of the final outcome of such litigation 

our products are complex and we run the risk of errors or defects with new product introductions or enhancements 

software products as complex as those developed by us may contain errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released although we have not experienced material adverse effects resulting from any such defects or errors to date we cannot assure you that material defects and errors will not be found after commencement of product shipments any such defects could result in loss of revenues or delay market acceptance 

our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims it is possible however that we may not always be able to negotiate such provisions in our contracts with customers or that the limitation of liability provisions contained in our license agreements may not be effective as a result of existing or future federal state or local laws ordinances or judicial decisions although we maintain errors and omissions and general liability insurance and we try to structure our contracts to include limitations on liability we cannot assure you that a successful claim could not be made or would not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our application service provider strategy has yet to gain widespread acceptance 

some businesses choose to access enterprise software applications through application service providers or asps which are businesses that host applications and provide access to software on a subscription basis the public sector market for asp solutions is new and unproven acceptance of our asp model depends upon the ability and willingness of different governmental entities to accept and implement asp solutions some prospective clients have expressed security and privacy concerns with the asp model including a concern regarding the confidential nature of the information and transactions available from and conducted with governments and concerns regarding offsite storage of such information we have limited experience selling our solutions through asps and may not be successful in generating revenue from this distribution channel 

changes in the insurance markets may affect our ability to win some contract awards and may lead to increased expenses 

some of our customers primarily those for our property appraisal services require that we secure performance bonds before they will select us as their vendor the number of qualified highrated insurance companies that offer performance bonds has decreased in recent years while the costs associated with securing these bonds has increased dramatically in addition we are generally required to issue a letter of credit as security for the issuance of a performance bond each letter of credit we issue without corresponding cash collateral reduces our borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit agreement we cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure such performance bonds in the future on terms that are favorable to us if at all our inability to obtain performance bonds on favorable terms or at all could impact our future ability to win some contract awards particularly large property appraisal services contracts which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

recent volatility in the stock markets increasing shareholder litigation the adoption of expansive legislation that redefines corporate controls in particular legislation adopted to prevent future corporate and accounting scandals as well as other factors have recently led to significant increases in premiums for directors’ and officers’ liability insurance the number of insurers offering directors and officers insurance at competitive rates has also decreased in recent years we cannot predict when the insurance market for such coverage will stabilize if at all the continued volatility of the insurance market may result in future increases in our general and administrative expenses which may adversely affect future operating results 

our stock price may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and may be significantly affected by many different factors some examples of factors that can have a significant impact on our stock price include 

 

in addition the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for the common stock of technology companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company we cannot assure you that similar litigation will not occur in the future with respect to us such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition 

historically we have not paid dividends on our common stock 

we have not declared or paid a cash dividend since we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector in february 1998 our credit agreement restricts our ability to pay cash dividends we intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law could deter takeover attempts

 item 3 legal proceedings 

on september 9 2005 affiliated computer services inc “acs” filed litigation in dallas county texas against thirtythree defendants including tyler and john m yeaman our chairman of the board “yeaman” the other named defendants include entities affiliated with william d oates “oates” a former director of ours and certain individuals employed by such entities the lawsuit alleges among other things that we breached the noncompetition and nonsolicitation covenants set forth in the stock purchase agreement dated december 29 2000 the “spa” between acs and us pursuant to which we sold to acs for cash all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of business resources corporation “brc” which comprised a significant portion of our then existing property records business in the spa we agreed to certain fiveyear noncompetition and nonsolicitation covenants which expired on december 29 2005 in addition the spa contained a closing condition pursuant to which oates agreed to amend his then existing threeyear noncompetition and nonsolicitation covenants so that the restricted activities would conform to the language of our restricted activities which covenants expired on december 29 2003 the lawsuit alleges that oates or entities owned by oates solicited acs employees and reentered the land records business after the expiration of his threeyear covenants but prior to the expiration of our fiveyear covenants and further alleges that we through our noncompete are legally responsible for oates’ actions the lawsuit further alleges that oates “controlled tyler” “manipulated tyler” and was a “legal representative” of ours for a significant but unspecified period of time following the sale of brc even though oates has not been a member of our board since 2001 has not been employed by us since the sale of brc has had limited contact with our management since the sale of brc and to our knowledge has not owned any stock in us since may 2003 the lawsuit further alleges that we fraudulently induced acs to enter into the spa because we allegedly knew that oates or entities owned by oates would reenter the land records business after three years even though the spa specifically contained different covenants with respect to oates and us acs entered into a settlement agreement with all of the defendants other than yeaman and us the terms of which are currently confidential however management believes that the settlement agreement extends the noncompete for oates and his related entities for some period of time 

we vehemently deny all allegations contained in the lawsuit management believes that we have not breached any noncompetition covenants have not solicited acs employees and have not misappropriated acs confidential information management further believes that the “factual” allegations made against us are false and inaccurate and that the legal theories asserted by acs are without merit management further believes based on discovery that has taken place to date that even if the allegations as currently set forth in the petition were true that acs has suffered no or nominal damage particularly in light of the settlement agreement with oates and his related entities 

we have filed counterclaims against acs including claims for business disparagement and defamation alleging that acs has published factually inaccurate and defamatory statements about us to third parties including our customers and prospective customers with malice andor negligence regarding the truth of those statements we intend to defend the lawsuit and pursue our counterclaims vigorously the future costs associated with such defense and in pursuit of the counterclaims are uncertain and difficult to predict and may be material 

other than ordinary course routine litigation incidental to our business and except as described in this annual report there are no material legal proceedings pending to which we are party or to which any of our properties are subject

our products are generally grouped into four major areas 

 

we monitor and analyze several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance these indicators include the following 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements the reported amounts of revenues cost of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the notes to the consolidated financial statements included as part of this annual report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including but not limited to those related to intangible assets bad debts and our service contracts we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of statement of position “sop” 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended by sop 984 and sop 989 as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants and in accordance with the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” we recognize revenue on our appraisal services contracts using the proportionate performance method of accounting with considerations for the provisions of emerging issue task force no 0021 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” our revenues are derived from sale of software licenses appraisal services maintenance and support and services that typically range from installation training and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs for multiple element software arrangements which do not entail the performance of services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software we generally record revenue when the delivered products or performed services result in a legally enforceable and nonrefundable claim we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized because most of our customers are governmental entities we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments in a limited number of cases we encounter a customer who is dissatisfied with some aspect of the software product or our service and we may offer a “concession” to such customer in those limited situations where we grant a concession we rarely reduce the contract arrangement fee but alternatively may perform additional services such as additional training or programming a minor feature the customer had in their prior software solution these amounts have historically been considered nominal in connection with our customer contracts and the adequacy of related allowances and measures of progress towards contract completion our project managers are charged with the responsibility to continually review the status of each customer on a specific contract basis also management at our corporate offices as well as at our operating companies review on at least a quarterly basis significant past due accounts receivable and the adequacy of related reserves events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments may require revision include but are not limited to deterioration of a customer’s financial condition failure to manage our customer’s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products 

for those software arrangements that include customization of the software which is considered essential to its functionality and for substantially all real estate appraisal outsourcing projects we recognize revenue and profit as the work progresses using the percentageofcompletion method and the proportionate performance method of revenue recognition these methods rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue billings and collections and expected contract costs as well as measures of progress toward completion we believe reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs and progress applicable to various stages of a contract can be made at times we perform additional andor noncontractual services for little to no incremental fee to satisfy 

customer expectations if changes occur in delivery productivity or other factors used in developing our estimates of expected costs or revenues we revise our cost and revenue estimates and any revisions are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision first become known 

we use contract accounting primarily the percentageofcompletion method for those software arrangements that include customization or modification of the software or where our software services are otherwise considered essential to the functionality of the software in addition we recognize revenue using the proportionate performance method of revenue recognition for our property appraisal projects some of which can range up to three years in connection with these and certain other contracts we may perform the work prior to when the services are billable andor payable pursuant to the contract the termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the fair value of products delivered and services performed in the event of an early termination in connection with certain of our contracts we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet date many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period management reviews unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue in addition we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue which represents billings in excess of revenue earned this liability primarily consists of maintenance billings in which payments are made in advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the maintenance period generally one year we also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit and the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product has not been met on a periodic basis we review by customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains appropriate 

intangible assets and goodwill  our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge the cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value with the excess allocated to goodwill accordingly we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets including software customer related intangibles trade name and goodwill in addition we capitalize software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility certain of these intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives all intangible assets with definite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of goodwill is generally measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its fair value generally determined by estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset recoverability of other intangible assets is generally measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows the assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include but are not limited to a significant decrease in the market value of the business or asset acquired a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the business or asset acquired is used or a significant adverse change in the business climate in addition products capabilities or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or noncompetitive 

analysis of results of operations and other 

the following discussion compares the historical results of operations on a basis consistent with gaap for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 these results include the results of the operations of eden from the date of its acquisition on december 2 2003 see note 2 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

2005 compared to 2004 

  revenues 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our revenues for the following years ended december 31 

 

software licenses  changes in software license revenues consist of the following components 

 

software services  changes in software services revenues consist of the following components 

 

 

maintenance  we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and third party software maintenance revenues increased due to growth in our installed customer base as evidenced by our software license revenue and slightly higher maintenance rates on certain product lines 

appraisal services the decrease in appraisal services revenues is due to the completion in 2004 of certain significant appraisal contracts these larger projects are often relatively discretionary in nature compared to smaller projects which tend to occur on a more consistent basis and the larger projects we recently completed have not been replaced by similar projects the appraisal services business is driven in part by revaluation cycles in various states and based on our new business pipeline we expect that appraisal services revenues in the foreseeable future will remain at historically low levels consistent with 2005 

  cost of revenues and gross margins 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues and associated gross margins and those components stated as a percentage of related revenues for the following years ended december 31 

 

cost of software license revenues the main component of our cost of software license revenues is amortization expense for capitalized development costs on certain software products with third party software costs making up the balance once a new product is released we begin to amortize the costs associated with its development amortization expense is determined on a productbyproduct basis at an annual rate not less than straightline basis over the product’s estimated life but not to exceed five years development costs consist mainly of personnel costs such as salary and benefits paid to our developers amortization expense for capitalized software products declined from 61 million in 2004 to 59 million in 2005 because certain software products became fully amortized during 2005 which offset new amortization expense from software products released in 2004 

cost of acquired software when we complete an acquisition we allocate the excess purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired to amortizable software customer and trade name intangibles with the remainder allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization amortization expense of acquired software is recorded as cost of revenues while amortization expense of other acquisition intangibles is recorded as amortization of customer and trademark intangibles in 2005 cost of acquired software declined compared to the prior year because certain acquired software assets recorded for previous acquisitions became fully amortized the estimated useful life of acquired software ranges from 3 to 5 years estimated annual amortization expense relating to acquired software excluding acquisitions completed in 2006 for the next five years is as follows in thousands 

 

 

cost of software services and maintenance revenues cost of software services and maintenance revenues primarily consists of expenses such as personnel costs related to installation of our software products conversion of customer data training customer personnel support activities and various other services such as application service provider “asp” and disaster recovery in 2005 

cost of software services and maintenance grew 11 while the related software services and maintenance revenues increased 8 compared to the prior year period during 2005 costs increased at a faster rate than related software services and maintenance revenues which reflects lower utilization of personnel in our appraisal and tax software division costs to support our recently released orion products a shift in the roles of certain of our development personnel whose costs were capitalized in 2004 to projects that were expensed in 2005 and higher health care costs 

cost of appraisal services revenues the decline in the cost of appraisal services revenues is the result of lower appraisal services revenues we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects whose term of employment generally ends with the projects’ completion in addition in the second quarter of 2005 we made significant organizational changes to our appraisal services division because of the declining gross margins see “restructuring charge” 

gross margin the overall gross margin for 2005 was 36 compared to 37 in 2004 the margin decline was due to cost inefficiencies associated with lower appraisal services revenues and efforts and costs to support our recently released orion products as well as a shift in the roles of certain of our development personnel whose costs were capitalized in 2004 to projects that are being expensed in 2005 and higher health care costs 

  selling general and administrative expenses 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our selling general and administrative “sga” expenses for the following years ended december 31 

 

selling general and administrative expenses increased mainly due to higher health care costs and an increase in the number of marketing personnel these increases were offset somewhat by lower consulting fees associated with documenting our internal control processes 

  restructuring charge 

because of unsatisfactory financial performance early in 2005 we made significant organizational changes to those areas of our business that were not performing to our expectations our goal was to bring costs in line with expected levels of revenue while improving the efficiency of our organizational structure to ensure that clients continue to receive superior service 

we currently anticipate that revenues in our appraisal services business are likely to remain at historically low levels in the foreseeable future consistent with 2005 and have reorganized that division to eliminate levels of management and reduce overhead expense we have also taken action to reduce headcount and costs in our appraisal and tax software division these cost reductions were made in the second quarter of 2005 as a result we reduced headcount in the appraisal services and appraisal and tax software businesses as well as in the corporate office by eliminating approximately 120 positions including management staff and projectrelated personnel additionally we have made changes in both management personnel and organizational structures at those business units and have reorganized our corporate structure to consolidate certain senior management positions 

in connection with the reorganization we incurred certain charges in the second quarter of 2005 those charges which were primarily comprised of employee severance costs and related fringe benefits totaled approximately 13 million before income taxes the related payments were made during the second and third quarter in 2005 

  amortization of customer and trade name intangibles 

acquisition intangibles are composed of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that is allocated to acquired and amortizable software customer and trade name intangibles with the remainder allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization however amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues while amortization expense of customer and trade name intangibles is recorded as a nonoperating expense the estimated useful lives of customer and trade name intangibles are 20 to 25 years and 5 to 25 years respectively the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the following years ended december 31 

 

estimated annual amortization expense relating to customer and trade name acquisition intangibles excluding acquired software for which the amortization expense is recorded as cost of revenues and excluding acquisitions completed in 2006 for the next five years is as follows in thousands 

 

  other 

interest income is the main component of other income which also includes nonusage and other fees associated with our credit agreement gain on sale of certain assets gain on risk management assets associated with a foreign exchange contract and miscellaneous other items other income increased compared to 2004 mainly due to higher interest rates and a small gain on sale of certain assets 

  income tax provision 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the following years ended december 31 

 

the effective income tax rate declined 2 from 2004 due to the qualified manufacturing activities deduction enacted in 2005 and a corporate reorganization in 2005 which favorably impacted our state income tax provision 

  2004 compared to 2003 

  revenues 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our revenues for the following years ended december 31 

 

software licenses  for the year ended december 31 2004 software license revenues included 35 million related to eden systems compared to 100000 for the same prior year period excluding the software license revenue related to eden the increase in software license revenues from 2003 to 2004 was approximately 900000 or 3 the change was the result of the following factors 

 

software services  software services revenues increased 49 million or 13 compared to the prior year period after excluding the increase in software services revenues generated by eden of 77 million higher software services revenues were attributable to the following factors 

 

maintenance  maintenance revenues for the year ended december 31 2004 included 41 million from eden compared to 300000 for the same prior year period excluding the impact of eden maintenance revenues during the year ended december 31 2004 

increased approximately 15 compared to 2003 due to growth in our installed customer base and slightly higher maintenance rates on certain product lines

appraisal services  the decrease in appraisal services revenues is due to the completion of certain significant appraisal contracts particularly the completion of our contract with lake county indiana in the fourth quarter of 2003 

  cost of revenues and gross margins 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues and associated gross margins and those components stated as a percentage of related revenues for the following years ended december 31 

 

cost of software license revenues  the increase is related to the general release of several software development products and the commencement of the related amortization expense product releases in 2004 include orion appraisal and tax products and an enhancement to one of our financial products amortization expense for 2004 also includes a full year of expense related to the odyssey courts and justice product versus only four months in 2003 

cost of acquired software in 2004 cost of acquired software declined compared to 2003 because certain acquired software assets recorded for previous acquisitions became fully amortized beginning mid 2003 and throughout 2004 this decline was offset somewhat by the amortization expense for acquisition software recorded for the acquisition of eden in december 2003 

cost of software services and maintenance revenues  during the year ended december 31 2004 eden contributed cost of software services and maintenance revenues of 79 million compared to 500000 in the prior year excluding eden cost of software services and maintenance revenues increased 83 million or 15 during 2004 in 2004 we added additional staff to provide faster implementation of our backlog excluding eden software services and maintenance revenues increased 14 for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to 2003 cost of software services and maintenance revenues increased more than the associated revenues due to the time required to train and orient additional personnel hired during 2004 before they can effectively perform revenuegenerating tasks such as training and implementations in addition expenses increased as the costs related to certain employees who previously worked on new software development products ceased to be capitalized as those projects were completed and these employees moved into implementation and support functions 

cost of appraisal services revenues  the decline in the cost of appraisal services revenues is consistent with lower appraisal services revenues in 2004 appraisal revenues declined at a faster rate than cost of appraisal revenues due to the use of subcontractors to supplement our appraisal staff on some of our larger contracts during 2004 resulting in lower margins the nature and timing of these contracts required us to retain staff on either short notice or with specific qualifications thus increasing the associated costs as a percentage of appraisal revenues 

gross margin excluding the results of eden our gross margin for 2004 was 37 compared to 38 in the prior year the decline in gross margin from the prior year period was due to the following factors 

 

 

  selling general and administrative expenses 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our selling general and administrative “sga” expenses for the following years ended december 31 

 

sga associated with eden amounted to 44 million in 2004 compared to 350000 in 2003 excluding eden sga increased 8 yearoveryear the increase in sga is a result of the following factors 

 

  amortization of customer and trade name intangibles 

amortization of customer and trade name intangibles increased in 2004 because it included a full year of amortization expense related to the december 2003 acquisition of eden 

  realized gain on sale of investment in hte inc  

on march 25 2003 we received cash proceeds of 393 million in connection with a transaction to sell all of our 56 million shares of hte inc “hte” common stock to sungard data systems inc for 700 cash per share our original cost basis in the hte shares was 158 million after transaction and other costs we recorded a gross realized gain of 232 million 162 million or 036 per diluted share after income taxes of 70 million for the year ended december 31 2003 

  income tax provision 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the following years ended december 31 

 

the effective income tax rates for the periods presented were different from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of 35 primarily due to the utilization of the capital loss carryforward in 2003 increased state income taxes and nondeductible meals and entertainment costs 

the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2003 includes income tax expense of 70 million relating to the realized gain from the sale of our investment in hte after reduction in valuation allowance related to the utilization of a capital loss carryforward amounting to 11 million on a taxeffected basis for 2003 we had an effective income tax rate of 38 excluding the effect of the hte gain compared to 42 in 2004 the majority of the increase was due to higher state income taxes because in 2004 we had more sales and profitability in highly taxed states than in the prior year 

  discontinued operations 

one of our nonoperating subsidiaries swan transportation company “swan” had been involved in various claims raised by former employees of a foundry that was owned by an affiliate of swan and tyler prior to december 1995 these claims were for alleged workrelated injuries and physical conditions resulting from alleged exposure to silica asbestos andor related industrial dusts after a series of bankruptcy court filings involving swan on december 23 2003 tyler in accordance with the terms of the plan of reorganization transferred the stock of swan to the swan asbestos and silica trust the “trust” an unaffiliated entity that will oversee the processing and payment of all present and future claims related to the foundry on december 23 2003 we paid 148 million to the trust in full and final release from all liability for claims associated with the onceowned foundry the “swan matter” as a result of the release any claimant is barred from asserting any such claim either now or in the future against tyler or its affected affiliates during the year ended december 31 2003 the gain on disposal of discontinued operations of 424000 primarily resulted because we fully settled the swan matter at an amount less than initially recorded and certain aspects of the settlement were structured in a beneficial tax manner accordingly we recognized for the first time certain tax benefits associated with payments on behalf of the swan matter 

  net income 

the following table sets forth a comparison of our net income earnings per diluted share income from continuing operations per diluted share and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the following years ended december 31 

 

net income for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 included a 162 million realized gain after income taxes relating to the sale of our investment in hte which had a diluted earnings per share effect of 036 per diluted share 

financial condition and liquidity 

historically we have funded our operations and cash expenditures primarily with cash generated from operating activities as of december 31 2005 our balance in cash and cash equivalents was 207 million and we had shortterm investments of 117 million compared to cash and cash equivalents of 126 million and shortterm investments of 138 million at december 31 2004 cash provided by operating activities was 212 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of 222 million in 2004 and 225 million in 2003 cash and shortterm investments increased primarily due to continued strong operating performance and higher deferred revenue due to additional maintenance customers and new contract signings 

at december 31 2005 our days sales outstanding “dsos” were 101 days compared to dsos of 89 days at december 31 2004 the increase in dsos is due primarily to timing of billings dsos are calculated based on accounts receivable excluding longterm receivables divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by 360 days 

investing activities provided cash of 18 million in 2005 compared to a use of cash of 99 million in 2004 and 590000 in 2003 in 2005 we significantly reduced our capitalized investments in software development and property and equipment and liquidated some short term investments and reinvested the proceeds in cash equivalents the cash used in investing activities in 2004 was comprised of investments in software development costs and property and equipment shortterm bond funds and additional purchase price payments related to the eden acquisition investing activities in 2003 included 393 million of gross proceeds on the sale of our investment in hte inc which was offset by the investment of such proceeds in shortterm bond funds software development costs property and equipment and the acquisition of eden 

during 2005 we made capital expenditures of 27 million including 17 million for computer equipment furniture and fixtures and 

expansions related to internal growth the other expenditures related to software development costs capital expenditures were funded from cash generated from operations

on february 11 2005 we entered into a revolving bank credit agreement the “credit facility” the credit facility matures february 11 2008 and provides for total borrowings of up to 300 million and a 100 million letter of credit facility under which the banks will issue cash collateralized letters of credit as of december 31 2005 our effective interest rate was 59 under the credit facility as of december 31 2005 we had no debt and outstanding letters of credit totaling 41 million to secure surety bonds required by some of our customer contracts as of february 27 2006 we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 

in january 2006 we acquired two companies mazikusa inc and tacs inc the combined purchase price for the two companies was approximately 142 million comprised of approximately 113 million cash and 325000 shares of tyler common stock we have not finalized the allocation of the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired companies but expect this allocation will result in noncash charges that will have a small dilutive effect on earnings per share in 2006 

excluding acquisitions we anticipate that 2006 capital spending will be between 35 million and 40 million the majority of which will be related to computer equipment and software for infrastructure expansions capital spending in 2006 is expected to be funded from existing cash balances and cash flows from operations 

from time to time we will engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates in order to pursue such opportunities which could require significant commitments of capital we may be required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive securities in the future no assurance can be given as to our future acquisition opportunities and how such opportunities will be financed in the absence of future acquisitions of other businesses we believe our current cash balances and expected future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital capital expenditures and other activities through the next twelve months if operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our needs we may borrow under our credit agreement 

we lease office facilities as well as transportation computer and other equipment used in our operations under noncancelable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through 2013 most leases contain renewal options and some contain purchase options following are the future obligations under noncancelable leases at december 31 2005 in thousands 

 

it is not our usual business practice to enter into offbalance sheet arrangements moreover it is not our normal policy to issue guarantees to third parties as of december 31 2005 we have no material purchase commitments except for the operating lease commitments listed above 

capitalization 

at december 31 2005 our capitalization consisted of 1122 million of shareholders’ equity 

new accounting pronouncements 

effective january 1 2006 we will be required to adopt statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r “sharebased payment” which among other things will require the recording in the financial statements of noncash compensation expense related to stock options and employee stock purchase plan transactions prior to 2006 we have only disclosed as permitted by sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” pro forma financial results including the effects of sharebased compensation expense in the footnotes to the financial statements we have chosen the “modified prospective” method of implementing sfas no 123r under the “modified prospective” method new awards will be valued and accounted for prospectively upon adoption outstanding prior awards that are unvested as of december 31 2005 will be recognized as compensation cost over the remaining requisite service period prior periods will not be restated based on stock options granted to employees through december 31 2005 we expect the adoption of sfas no 123r on january 1 2006 will reduce first quarter net earnings by approximately 320000 001 per share diluted and reduce full year 2006 net earnings by approximately 13 million 003 per share diluted 

sfas no 123r also requires employee stock purchase plans espp with purchase price discounts greater than 5 to be compensatory our espp has a 15 purchase price discount but the plan can be modified at any time we expect the related compensatory charge would reduce first quarter 2006 net earnings by approximately 50000 000 per share diluted and reduce full year 2006 net earnings by approximately 200000 001 per share diluted 

sfas no 123r includes several modifications to the way that income taxes are recorded in the financial statements the expense for certain types of option grants is only deductible for tax purposes at the time that the taxable event takes place which could cause variability in our effective tax rates recorded throughout the year sfas no 123r does not allow companies to “predict” when these taxable events will take place furthermore it requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date these future amounts cannot be estimated because they depend on among other things when employees exercise stock options however the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions as shown in our consolidated statement of cash flows were 313000 582000 and 292000 respectively for 2005 2004 and 2003 see notes 1 and 12 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our stockbased compensation plans 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial market prices and interest rates as of december 31 2005 we had funds invested in auction rate municipal bonds which we accounted for in accordance with sfas no 115 “accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities” these investments were treated as availableforsale under sfas no 115 the carrying value of these investments approximates fair market value due to the nature of this investment we are not subject to significant market rate risk 

we have no outstanding debt at december 31 2005 and we therefore are not subject to any interest rate risk 

in order to enhance our ability to manage foreign currency risk associated with one contract in december 2005 we contracted with a commercial bank to enter into a series of forward contracts at no material cost to us to acquire canadian dollars through 2009 at fixed prices these forward contracts have been entered into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposure in this contract and do not constitute positions independent of this exposure we had approximately 100000 of current risk management assets associated with these foreign exchange contracts at december 31 2005 if the applicable exchange rate was to increase or decrease 

10 from the rate at december 31 2005 our current risk management assets would increase or decrease approximately 300000 we do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument at december 31 2004 we did not have any forward contracts in place

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures — our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in securities exchange act rules 13a15e as of december 31 2005 based on such evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that as of december 31 2005 such disclosure controls and procedures were effective and designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the securities exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

internal control over financial reporting — during the quarter ended december 31 2005 there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as defined in securities exchange act rule 13a15f and 15d15f that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting — tyler’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in securities exchange act rule 13a15f tyler’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to tyler’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

management assessed the effectiveness of tyler’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control — integrated framework  based on our assessment we believe that as of december 31 2005 tyler’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria 

management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 has been audited by ernst  young llp the independent registered public accounting firm who also audited tyler’s consolidated financial statements ernst  young’s attestation report on management’s assessment of tyler’s internal control over financial reporting appears on page f2 hereof

industrial conglomerate with operations in various industrial retail and distribution businesses all of which have been sold or otherwise disposed in 1997 we embarked on a multiphase growth plan focused on serving the specialized information management needs of local governments nationwide in 1998 and 1999 we made a series of strategic acquisitions of companies in the local government it market in addition to our continuing operations in the software and services business described above we also operated from 1998 through 2000 a business segment focused on providing outsourced property records management for local governments and reselling related data in late 2000 we decided to dispose of the information and property records services segment in order to strengthen our balance sheet and allow us to focus our resources on the segment of business that we believe offers the greatest growth and profit opportunities we expect to continue to capitalize on these opportunities by leveraging our large national client base our longterm relationships with local government customers and our deep domain expertise in local government operations through the development of stateoftheart technologies and new nationally branded applications solutions we have and are continuing to develop a new generation of software products some of which are based on ntier architecture sqlcompliant databases browser compatibility and componentbased technology market overview the state and local government market is one of the largest and most decentralized it markets in the country consisting of all 50 states approximately 3100 counties 36000 cities and towns and 14500 school districts this market is also comprised of approximately 35000 special districts and other agencies each with specialized delegated responsibilities and unique information management requirements traditionally local government bodies and agencies performed statemandated duties including property assessment record keeping road maintenance law enforcement administration of election and judicial functions and the provision of welfare assistance today a host of emerging and urgent issues are confronting local governments each of which demands a service response these areas include criminal justice and corrections administration and finance public safety health and human services and public works transfers of responsibility from the federal and state governments to county and municipal governments and agencies in these and other areas also place additional service and financial requirements on these local government units in addition constituents of local governments are increasingly demanding improved service and better access to information from public entities as a result local governments recognize the increasing value of information management systems and services to among other things improve revenue collection provide increased access to information and streamline delivery of services to their constituents local government bodies are now recognizing that “egovernment” is an additional responsibility for community development from integrated tax systems to integrated civil and criminal justice information systems many counties and cities have benefited significantly from the implementation of jurisdictionwide systems that allow different agencies or government offices to share data and provide a more comprehensive approach to information management many city and county governmental agencies also have unique individual information management requirements which must be tailored to the specific functions of each particular office 3 

many local governments also have difficulties attracting and retaining the staff necessary to support their it functions as a result they seek to establish longterm relationships with reliable providers of high quality it products and services such as tyler although local governments generally face budgetary constraints in their operations their primary revenue sources are usually property taxes and to a lesser extent utility fees which tend to be relatively stable in addition the acquisition of new technology typically enables local governments to operate more efficiently and often provides a measurable return on investment that justifies the purchase of software and related services gartner dataquest estimates that state and local government spending for it products and services will grow from 423 billion in 2004 to 508 billion in 2007 with local government accounting for 211 billion of it spending in 2004 and 249 billion in 2007 the external services and software segments of the market where our business is primarily focused are expected to be the most rapidly growing areas of the local government it market expanding from 94 billion in 2004 to 125 billion in 2007 products and services we provide a comprehensive and flexible suite of products and services that address the information technology needs of cities counties schools and other local government entities we derive our revenues from four primary sources  we design develop and market a broad range of software products to serve missioncritical “backoffice” functions of local governments our software applications are designed primarily for use on hardware supporting unixnt operating systems many of our software applications include internetaccessible solutions that allow for realtime public access to a variety of information or that allow the public to transact business with local governments via the internet our software products and services are generally grouped in four major product areas  each of our core software systems consists of several fully integrated application modules for customers who acquire the software for use inhouse we generally license our systems under standard license agreements that provide the customer with a fully paid nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software in some of the product areas such as financials and property appraisal we offer multiple solutions designed to meet the needs of different sized governments we also offer certain software products on an outsourced basis for customers who do not wish to maintain update and operate these systems or to make large upfront capital expenditures to implement these advanced technologies for these customers we either host the applications and data at one of our data centers or maintain the hardware and software at the client’s site customers typically pay monthly fees under multiyear contracts for these services historically we have had a higher concentration of revenues in the second half of our fiscal year due to governmental budget and spending cycles a description of our suite of products and services follows software licensing financial and city solutions our financial and city solutions products are erp enterprise resource planning systems for local governments which integrate information across all facets of a client organization our financial products include modular fund accounting systems that can be 4

 when considering acquisition opportunities we generally focus on companies with strong management teams and employee groups and excellent customer relationships in december 2003 we acquired eden systems inc “eden” a provider of financial personnel and citizen services systems for local governments in december 2003 we also acquired certain assets of a business that provides forms software to users of some of our software products prior to these acquisitions our most recent acquisition was completed in november 1999 critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the notes to the consolidated financial statements included as part of this annual report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including but not limited to those related to intangible assets bad debts and our service contracts we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position “sop” 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended by sop 984 and sop 989 as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants and in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” our revenues are derived from sale of software licenses appraisal services maintenance and support and services that typically range from installation training and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs for multiple element software arrangements which do not entail the performance of services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software we generally record revenue when the delivered products or performed services result in a legally enforceable and nonrefundable claim we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts sales adjustments and estimated cost of product warranties which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized because most of our customers are governmental entities we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments occasionally customers may become dissatisfied with the functionality of the software products andor the quality of the services and request a reduction of the total contract price or similar concession while we engage in extensive product and service quality assurance programs and processes our allowances for these contract price reductions may need to be revised in the future in connection with our customer contracts and the adequacy of related allowances and measures of progress towards contract completion our project managers are charged with the responsibility to continually review the status of each customer on a specific contract basis also management at our corporate offices as well as at our operating companies review on at least a quarterly basis significant past due accounts receivable and the adequacy of related reserves events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts sales adjustments and estimated cost of product warranties may require revision include but are not limited to deterioration of a customer’s financial condition failure to manage our customer’s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products for those software arrangements that include customization of the software which is considered essential to its functionality and for substantially all of our real estate appraisal outsourcing projects we recognize revenue and profit as the work progresses using the 16 

percentageofcompletion method and the proportionate performance method of revenue recognition these methods rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue billings and collections and expected contract costs as well as measures of progress toward completion we believe reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs and progress applicable to various stages of a contract can be made at times we perform additional andor noncontractual services for little to no incremental fee to satisfy customer expectations if changes occur in delivery productivity or other factors used in developing our estimates of expected costs or revenues we revise our cost and revenue estimates and any revisions are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision first become known we use contract accounting primarily the percentageofcompletion method for those software arrangements that include customization or modification of the software or where our software services are otherwise considered essential to the functionality of the software in addition we recognize revenue using the proportionate performance method of revenue recognition for our real estate appraisal projects some of which can range up to three years in connection with these and certain other contracts we may perform the work prior to when the services are billable andor payable pursuant to the contract the termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the fair value of products delivered and services performed in the event of an early termination in connection with certain of our contracts we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet date many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period management reviews unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue in addition we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue which represents billings in excess of revenue earned this liability primarily consists of maintenance billings in which payments are made in advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the maintenance period generally one year we also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit and the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product has not been met on a periodic basis we review by customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains appropriate intangible assets and goodwill  our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge the cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value with the excess allocated to goodwill accordingly we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets including software customer related intangibles trade name and goodwill in addition we capitalize software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility certain of these intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives all intangible assets with definite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of goodwill is generally measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its fair value generally determined by estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset recoverability of other intangible assets is generally measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows the assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include but are not limited to a significant decrease in the market value of the business or asset acquired a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the business or asset acquired is used or a significant adverse change in the business climate in addition products capabilities or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or noncompetitive 17 

analysis of results of operations and other the following discussion compares the historical results of operations on a basis consistent with gaap for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 these results include the results of operations of eden from the date of its acquisition on december 2 2003 see note 2 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 2004 compared to 2003   revenues the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our revenues for the following years ended december 31  

software licenses  for the year ended december 31 2004 software license revenues included 35 million related to eden systems compared to 100000 for the same prior year period excluding the software license revenue related to eden the increase in software license revenues from 2003 to 2004 was approximately 900000 or 3 the change was the result of the following factors  we have recently introduced a variety of new software products which have replaced certain legacy products the acceptance of these new products in the marketplace is ongoing the following software products have been released in the last two years  

software services  software services revenues increased 49 million or 13 compared to the prior year period after excluding the increase in software services revenues generated by eden of 77 million higher software services revenues were attributable to the following factors  maintenance  we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and third party software maintenance revenues for the year ended december 31 2004 included 41 million from eden compared to 300000 for the same prior year period excluding the impact of eden maintenance revenues during the year ended december 31 2004 increased approximately 15 compared to 2003 due to growth in our installed customer base and slightly higher maintenance rates on certain product lines appraisal services  the decrease in appraisal services revenues is due to the completion of certain significant appraisal contracts particularly the completion of our contract with lake county indiana in the fourth quarter of 2003 these larger projects are often relatively discretionary in nature and the projects we recently completed have not been replaced by similar projects   cost of revenues and gross margins the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues and associated gross margins and those components stated as a percentage of related revenues for the following years ended december 31  

cost of software license revenues  the increase is related to the general release of several software development products and the commencement of the related amortization expense once a product is released we begin to amortize the costs associated with its development over the estimated useful life of the product amortization expense is determined on a productbyproduct basis at an annual rate not less than straightline basis over the product’s estimated life generally 35 years development costs consist mainly of personnel costs such as salary and benefits paid to our developers and rent for related office space current year product releases include the orion appraisal and tax products and an enhancement to one of our financial and city solutions products amortization expense for 2004 also includes a full year of expense related to odyssey courts versus only four months in 2003 19 

cost of software services and maintenance revenues  cost of software services and maintenance revenues primarily consists of expenses such as personnel costs related to installation of our software licenses conversion of customer data training customer personnel support activities and various other services such as asp and disaster recovery during the year ended december 31 2004 eden contributed cost of software services and maintenance revenues of 79 million compared to 500000 in the prior year excluding eden cost of software services and maintenance revenues increased 83 million or 15 during 2004 additional staff has been added to provide faster implementation of our existing backlog excluding eden software services and maintenance revenues increased 14 for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to 2003 cost of software services and maintenance revenues increased more than the associated revenues due to the time required to train and orient additional personnel hired during 2004 before they can effectively perform revenuegenerating tasks such as training and implementations in addition expenses increased as the costs related to certain employees who previously worked on new software development products ceased to be capitalized as those projects were completed and these employees moved into implementation and support functions cost of appraisal services revenues  the decline in the cost of appraisal services revenues is consistent with lower appraisal services revenues in 2004 appraisal revenues declined at a faster rate than cost of appraisal revenues due to the use of subcontractors to supplement our appraisal staff on some of our larger contracts during 2004 resulting in lower margins the nature and timing of these contracts required us to retain staff on either short notice or with specific qualifications thus increasing the associated costs as a percentage of appraisal revenues gross margin excluding the results of eden our gross margin for 2004 was 37 compared to 39 in the prior year the decline in gross margin from the prior year period was due to the following factors    selling general and administrative expenses the following table sets forth a comparison of our selling general and administrative expenses sga for the following years ended december 31  

sga associated with eden amounted to 44 million in 2004 compared to 350000 in 2003 excluding eden sga increased 8 yearoveryear the increase in sga is a result of the following factors  20 

  amortization of acquisition intangibles the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of acquisition intangibles for the following years ended december 31  

amortization expense has declined compared to the prior year due to certain intangible assets recorded for previous acquisitions that became fully amortized beginning mid 2003 and throughout 2004 this decline was offset somewhat by the amortization expense for acquisition intangibles recorded for the acquisition of eden in december 2003 acquisition intangibles are composed of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that is allocated to acquired and amortizable software customer related intangibles and trade name with the remainder allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization the estimated useful lives of acquired software customer related intangibles and trade name are 3 to 5 years 20 to 25 years and 5 to 25 years respectively estimated annual amortization expense relating to acquisition intangibles for the next five years is as follows in thousands  

  realized gain on sale of investment in hte inc  on march 25 2003 we received cash proceeds of 393 million in connection with a transaction to sell all of our 56 million shares of hte inc “hte” common stock to sungard data systems inc for 700 cash per share our original cost basis in the hte shares was 158 million after transaction and other costs we recorded a gross realized gain of 232 million 162 million or 036 per diluted share after income taxes of 70 million for the year ended december 31 2003   income tax provision the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the following years ended december 31  

the effective income tax rates for the periods presented were different from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of 35 primarily due to the utilization of the capital loss carryforward in 2003 increased state income taxes and nondeductible meals and entertainment costs the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2003 includes income tax expense of 70 million relating to the realized gain from the sale of our investment in hte after reduction in valuation allowance related to the utilization of a capital loss carryforward amounting to 11 million on a taxeffected basis for 2003 we had an effective income tax rate of 38 excluding the effect of the hte gain compared to 42 in 2004 the majority of the increase was due to higher state income taxes because in 2004 we had more sales and profitability in highly taxed states than in the prior year   discontinued operations one of our nonoperating subsidiaries swan transportation company “swan” had been involved in various claims raised by former employees of a foundry that was owned by an affiliate of swan and tyler prior to december 1995 these claims were for alleged workrelated injuries and physical conditions resulting from alleged exposure to silica asbestos andor related industrial dusts after a series of bankruptcy court filings involving swan on december 23 2003 tyler in accordance with the terms of the plan of reorganization transferred the stock of swan to the swan asbestos and silica trust “trust” an unaffiliated entity that will oversee 21 

the processing and payment of all present and future claims related to the foundry on december 23 2003 we paid 148 million to the trust in full and final release from all liability for claims associated with the onceowned foundry the “swan matter” as a result of the release any claimant is barred from asserting any such claim either now or in the future against tyler or its affected affiliates during the year ended december 31 2003 the gain on disposal of discontinued operations of 424000 primarily resulted because we fully settled the swan matter at an amount less than initially recorded and certain aspects of the settlement were conducted in a beneficial tax manner accordingly we recognized for the first time certain tax benefits associated with payments on behalf of the swan matter   net income the following table sets forth a comparison of our net income earnings per diluted share income from continuing operations per diluted share and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the following years ended december 31  

net income for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 included a 162 million realized gain after income taxes relating to the sale of our investment in hte which had a diluted earnings per share effect of 036 per diluted share 2003 compared to 2002   revenues the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our revenues for the following years ended december 31  

software licenses  software license revenues for 2003 benefited from the successful first phase installation of odyssey courts in the state of minnesota and lee county florida software license revenues from these two contracts totaled 34 million for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to none in the prior year in addition we increased revenues from our financial and city solutions software products by approximately 200000 primarily by increasing sales and implementation staff and releasing a new version of one of our county tax products for our customers in the midwest however sales of thirdparty software licenses relating to our financial and city solutions products declined by approximately 700000 due to the sales of a onetime upgrade of the graphical user interface on some of our proprietary products in 2002 and decreased emphasis on sales of thirdparty licenses in 2003 in late 2003 we opened a new financial and city solutions sales office in california in an effort to further penetrate the west coast market we also experienced a decline in our property appraisal and tax software license revenues of approximately 750000 most of this decline related to one large property appraisal and tax software installation in the third quarter of 2002 22 

software services  higher software services revenues were attributable to the following factors  maintenance  the maintenance revenue increase was due to growth in our installed customer base and slightly higher rates on certain product lines appraisal services  the decrease is related to the completion and progression of several major appraisal contracts during 2003 we signed a new sixyear contract to provide nassau county new york board of assessors “nassau county extension” with updated property assessments and additional property appraisal and tax software the following table contains the appraisal services revenues for significant contracts for the years presented  

cost of revenues and gross margins the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues and gross margins and those components stated as a percentage of associated revenues for the years ended december 31  

cost of software license revenues  in september 2003 we began amortizing the software development costs of our odyssey courts product as it was complete and ready for general release to the public the amortization for odyssey courts is calculated using the straightline method of amortization over an estimated fiveyear useful life in 2003 we recorded amortization expense of approximately 559000 related to odyssey courts for the period september 1 2003 general release date through december 31 2003 in addition during 2002 we had several smaller products in the development stage released in late 2002 and early 2003 that contributed to the increase in amortization expense 23 

cost of software services and maintenance revenues  the increase in costs is consistent with higher software services and maintenance revenues for the same periods although software services and maintenance revenues grew at a more rapid rate than the cost of those revenues which is reflective of more efficient utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale cost of appraisal services revenues  the decrease in the cost of appraisal services revenues is consistent with the decrease in appraisal services revenues we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects whose term of employment generally ends with the projects’ completion however key appraisal personnel and management were retained in anticipation of new appraisal contracts which contributed to a 3 decline in appraisal gross margins compared to 2002 gross margin our overall gross margin improved over the prior year due to higher software services and maintenance revenues without a corresponding increase in related personnel costs reflecting a more efficient utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale improvements in software services and maintenance gross margin were slightly offset by declines in software license gross margin due to amortization of new product releases and declines in the appraisal services gross margin   selling general and administrative expenses the following table sets forth a comparison of our sga for the following years ended december 31  

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in 2003 compared to 2002 is a result of the following factors    amortization of acquisition intangibles the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of acquisition intangibles for the following years ended december 31  

the decrease in amortization from 2002 is related to certain of our acquisition intangibles becoming fully amortized during 2003 24 

  other income expense net the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of other income expense net for the following years ended december 31  

during the year ended december 31 2002 we incurred approximately 704000 of legal and other costs associated with legal matters concerning various tort claims hte alleged against us and hte’s attempted redemption of our 56 million shares for 130 per share in september 2002 hte released us from all tort claims and a court declared hte’s reported redemption of our shares was invalid in march 2003 we sold for cash our entire investment in hte for 700 per share the increase in interest income is related to higher invested cash balances including 393 million in cash received upon the sale of our investment in hte in late march 2003 proceeds from the exercise of stock options as well as cash generated from operations the cash received from the sale of hte was offset by payments totaling 241 million for repurchase of a total of approximately 60 million shares of our common stock in a modified dutch auction tender offer in may 2003 and on the open market throughout 2003 in addition we made a cash payment of approximately 121 million net of cash acquired for two acquisitions made in december 2003 the most significant of which is eden   income tax provision the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the following years ended december 31  

the 2003 income tax provision includes income tax expense of approximately 70 million relating to the realized gain from the sale of our investment in hte after reduction in valuation allowance related to the utilization of a capital loss carryforward amounting to 11 million on a taxeffected basis for the year ended december 31 2003 we had an effective income tax rate of 38 excluding the effect of the hte gain the effective income tax rates for 2003 compared to 2002 were different from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of 35 primarily due to the utilization of the capital loss carryforward in 2003 state income taxes and nondeductible meals and entertainment costs 25 

  net income the following table sets forth a comparison of our net income earnings per diluted share income from continuing operations per diluted share and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the years ended december 31  

during 2003 we repurchased approximately 60 million shares of our common stock through our modified dutch auction tender offer and purchases on the open market had we not executed those repurchases our net income per share including the gain on the sale of our investment in hte for the year ended december 31 2003 would have been reduced by 007 per diluted share new accounting pronouncements in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” recently enacted statement of financial accounting standards no 123r “sfas no 123r” “sharebased payment” which replaces statement of financial accounting standards no 123 “sfas no 123” “accounting for stockbased compensation” and supersedes apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” sfas no 123r requires the measurement of all employee sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options using a fairvaluebased method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of operations the accounting provisions of sfas no 123r are effective for reporting periods beginning after june 15 2005 we are required to adopt sfas no 123r in the third quarter of 2005 the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition see note 1 in our notes to consolidated financial statements for the estimated impact on net income and net income per diluted share amounts for the third and fourth quarter of 2005 of recording sharebased payments in our consolidated statement of operations using a fairvaluebased method similar to the methods required under sfas no 123r to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards financial condition and liquidity historically we have funded our operations and cash expenditures primarily with cash generated from operating activities as of december 31 2004 our balance in cash and cash equivalents was 126 million and we had shortterm investments of 138 million compared to cash and cash equivalents of 103 million and shortterm investments of 117 million at december 31 2003 cash provided by operating activities was 222 million compared to cash provided by operations of 225 million in 2003 and 198 million in 2002 cash and shortterm investments increased primarily due to continued strong operating performance and collections of receivables at december 31 2004 our days sales outstanding “dsos” were 92 days compared to dsos of 98 days at december 31 2003 the decrease in dsos is due primarily to continued strong cash collections during 2004 dsos are determined based on accounts receivable divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by 360 days investing activities used cash of 99 million in 2004 compared to 590000 in 2003 and 80 million in 2002 the cash used in investing activities in 2004 was comprised of investments in software development costs and property and equipment shortterm bond funds and additional purchase price payments related to the eden acquisition investing activities in 2003 included 393 million of gross proceeds on the sale of our investment in hte inc which was offset by the investment of such proceeds in shortterm bond funds software development costs property and equipment and the acquisition of eden on february 11 2005 we entered into a new revolving bank credit agreement the “2005 credit facility” the 2005 credit facility matures february 11 2008 and provides for total borrowings of up to 300 million and a 100 million letter of credit facility under which the banks will issue cash collateralized letters of credit as of february 28 2005 our effective interest rate was 42 under the 26

we primarily lease offices as well as transportation computer and other equipment used in our operations under noncancelable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through 2013 most leases contain renewal options and some contain purchase options following are the future obligations under noncancelable leases at december 31 2004 in thousands  

it is not our usual business practice to enter into offbalance sheet arrangements moreover it is not our normal policy to issue guarantees to third parties as of december 31 2004 we have no material purchase commitments except for the operating lease commitments listed above capitalization at december 31 2004 our capitalization consisted of 1184 million of shareholders’ equity factors that may affect future results and market price of our stock an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk investors evaluating our company should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this annual report any of the following factors could materially harm our business operating results and financial condition additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business operating results and financial condition this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report we may make forwardlooking statements from time to time both written and oral we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forwardlooking statements our actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forwardlooking statements due to a number of factors including those set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report a decline in information technology spending may result in a decrease in our revenues or lower our growth rate a decline in the demand for information technology among our current and prospective customers may result in decreased revenues or a lower growth rate for us because our sales depend in part on our customers’ level of funding for new or additional information technology systems and services moreover demand for our solutions may be reduced by a decline in overall demand for computer software and services accordingly we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase or maintain our revenues we may experience fluctuations in quarterly revenue that could adversely impact our stock price and our operating results our actual revenues in a quarter could fall below expectations which could lead to a decline in our stock price our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter revenues from license fees in any quarter depend substantially upon our contracting activity and our ability to recognize revenues in that quarter in accordance with our revenue recognition policies our quarterly revenue may fluctuate and may be difficult to forecast for a variety of reasons including the following  28 

 fluctuation in our quarterly revenues may adversely affect our operating results in each fiscal quarter our expense levels operating costs and hiring plans are based on projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed if our actual revenues fall below expectations we could experience a reduction in operating results as with other software vendors we may be required to delay revenue recognition into future periods which could adversely impact our operating results we have in the past had to and in the future may have to defer revenue recognition for license fees due to several factors including whether  because of the factors listed above and other specific requirements under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states for software revenue recognition we must have very precise terms in our license agreements in order to recognize revenue when we initially deliver and install software or perform services negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions can extend the sales cycle and sometimes we do not obtain terms and conditions that permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery or even as work on the project is completed compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 new securities and exchange commission regulations and new york stock exchange rules are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours the costs required to comply with such evolving laws are difficult to predict to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards this investment may result in an unforeseen increase in general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities which may harm our business financial condition or results of operations increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins and adversely affect our operating results we realize lower margins on software and appraisal service revenues than on license revenue the majority of our contracts include both software licenses and the provision of professional services therefore an increase in the percentage of software service and appraisal service revenue compared to license revenue could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and could adversely affect operating results selling products and services into the public sector poses unique challenges we derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of software and services to state county and city governments other municipal agencies and other public entities we expect that sales to public sector customers will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues in the future we face many risks and challenges associated with contracting with governmental entities including  29 

 each of these risks is outside our control if we fail to adequately adapt to these risks and uncertainties our financial performance could be adversely affected the open bidding process for governmental contracts creates uncertainty in predicting future contract awards many governmental agencies purchase products and services through an open bidding process generally a governmental entity will publish an established list of requirements requesting potential vendors to propose solutions for the established requirements to respond successfully to these requests for proposals we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract the time required to establish operations for the proposed client and the likely terms of any other third party proposals submitted we cannot guarantee that we will win any bids in the future through the request for proposal process or that any winning bids will ultimately result in contracts on favorable terms our failure to secure contracts through the open bidding process or to secure such contracts on favorable terms may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations fixed price contracts may affect our profits some of our present contracts are on a fixedpriced basis which can lead to various risks including  if we do not adequately assess these and other risks we may be subject to cost overruns and penalties which may harm our business financial condition or results of operations we face significant competition from other vendors and potential new entrants into our markets we believe we are a leading provider of integrated solutions for the public sector however we face competition from a variety of software vendors that offer products and services similar to those offered by us as well as from companies offering to develop custom software we compete on the basis of a number of factors including  we believe the market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors that vary in size primary computer platforms and overall product scope our competitors include the consulting divisions of national and regional accounting firms publicly held companies that focus on selected segments of the public sector market and a significant number of smaller privately held companies certain competitors have greater technical marketing and financial resources than us we cannot assure you that such competitors will not develop products or offer services that are superior to our products or services or that achieve greater market acceptance we also compete with internal centralized information service departments of governmental entities which requires us to persuade the enduser to stop the internal service and outsource to us in addition our customers may elect in the future to provide information management services internally through new or existing departments which will reduce the market for our services 30 

we could face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the public sector software application market and new products and technologies are introduced increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share in addition current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with thirdparties thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share further competitive pressures could require us to reduce the price of our software licenses and related services we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the failure to do so would have material adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition we must respond to rapid technological changes to be competitive the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards in computer hardware and software technology changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result our future success will depend in part upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products and develop and introduce in a timely manner or acquire new products that keep pace with technological developments satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and costeffective manner further we cannot assure you that the products capabilities or technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive if we are unable to develop or acquire on a timely and costeffective basis new software products or enhancements to existing products or if such new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance our business operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected our failure to properly manage growth could adversely affect our business we have expanded our operations rapidly since february 1998 when we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector we intend to continue expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities this rapid growth places a significant demand on management and operational resources in order to manage growth effectively we must implement and improve our operational systems procedures and controls on a timely basis we must also identify hire train and manage key managerial and technical personnel if we fail to implement these systems or employ and retain such qualified personnel our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected in addition a significant portion of our growth has resulted from strategic acquisitions in new product and geographic markets although our future focus will be on internal growth we will continue to identify and pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances with suitable candidates our future success will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate future acquisitions and other strategic alliances into our operations acquisitions may involve a number of special risks including diversion of management’s attention failure to retain key acquired personnel unanticipated events or circumstances legal liabilities and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we conduct due diligence reviews of potential acquisition candidates we may not identify all material liabilities or risks related to acquisition candidates there can be no assurance that any such strategic acquisitions or alliances will be accomplished on favorable terms or will result in profitable operations we may be unable to hire integrate and retain qualified personnel our continued success will depend upon the availability and performance of our key management sales marketing customer support and product development personnel the loss of key management or technical personnel could adversely affect us we believe that our continued success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract integrate and retain such personnel we have at times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel competition for qualified software development sales and other personnel is intense and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 31 

we may experience difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy we occasionally expand our business through the acquisition of complementary companies we cannot however make any assurances that we will be able to identify any potential acquisition candidates or complete any additional acquisitions on terms that are acceptable to us in addition we cannot assure you that any future acquisitions will be successfully integrated or will be advantageous to us we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights many of our product and service offerings incorporate proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of contracts copyrights and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology we cannot be certain that we have taken all appropriate steps to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property in addition there has been significant litigation in the united states in recent years involving intellectual property rights we are not currently involved in any material intellectual property litigation we may however be a party to intellectual property litigation in the future to protect our proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights further we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us in the future with respect to current or future products any claims or litigation with or without merit could be timeconsuming and result in costly litigation and diversion of management’s attention further any claims and litigation could cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements such royalty or licensing arrangements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all thus litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations regardless of the final outcome of such litigation our products are complex and as such we run the risk of errors or defects with new product introductions or enhancements software products as complex as those developed by us may contain errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released although we have not experienced material adverse effects resulting from any such defects or errors to date we cannot assure you that material defects and errors will not be found after commencement of product shipments any such defects could result in loss of revenues or delay market acceptance our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims it is possible however that we may not always be able to negotiate such provisions in our contracts with customers or that the limitation of liability provisions contained in our license agreements may not be effective as a result of existing or future federal state or local laws ordinances or judicial decisions although we maintain errors and omissions and general liability insurance and we try to structure our contracts to include limitations on liability we cannot assure you that a successful claim could not be made or would not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our application service provider strategy has yet to gain widespread acceptance some businesses choose to access enterprise software applications through application service providers or asps which are businesses that host applications and provide access to software on a subscription basis the public sector market for asp solutions is new and unproven acceptance of our asp model depends upon the ability and willingness of different governmental entities to accept and implement asp solutions some prospective clients have expressed security and privacy concerns with the asp model including a concern regarding the confidential nature of the information and transactions available from and conducted with governments and concerns regarding offsite storage of such information we have limited experience selling our solutions through asps and may not be successful in generating revenue from this distribution channel 32 

changes in the insurance markets may affect our ability to win some contract awards and may lead to increased expenses some of our customers primarily those for our property appraisal services require that we secure performance bonds before they will select us as their vendor the number of qualified highrated insurance companies that offer performance bonds has decreased in recent years while the costs associated with securing these bonds has increased dramatically in addition we are generally required to issue a letter of credit as security for the issuance of a performance bond each letter of credit we issue without corresponding cash collateral reduces our borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit agreement we cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure such performance bonds in the future on terms that are favorable to us if at all our inability to obtain performance bonds on favorable terms or at all could impact our future ability to win some contract awards particularly large property appraisal services contracts which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations recent volatility in the stock markets increasing shareholder litigation the adoption of expansive legislation that redefines corporate controls in particular legislation adopted to prevent future corporate and accounting scandals as well as other factors have recently led to significant increases in premiums for directors’ and officers’ liability insurance the number of insurers offering directors and officers insurance at competitive rates has also decreased in recent years we cannot predict when the insurance market for such coverage will stabilize if at all the continued volatility of the insurance market may result in future increases in our general and administrative expenses which may adversely affect future operating results our stock price may be volatile the market price of our common stock may be volatile and may be significantly affected by many different factors some examples of factors that can have a significant impact on our stock price include  in addition the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for the common stock of technology companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company we cannot assure you that similar litigation will not occur in the future with respect to us such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition historically we have not paid dividends on our common stock we have not declared or paid a cash dividend since we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector in february 1998 our credit agreement restricts our ability to pay cash dividends we intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future provisions in our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law could deter takeover attempts our board of directors may issue up to 1000000 shares of preferred stock and may determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting and conversion rights of these shares of preferred stock these determinations may be made without any further vote or action by our stockholders the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock in addition some provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and of the delaware general corporation law could also delay prevent or make more difficult a merger tender offer or proxy contest involving us 33 

financial outlook from time to time in press releases and otherwise we may publish forecasts or other forwardlooking statements regarding our results including estimated revenues or net earnings any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties and as a matter of course any number of them may prove to be incorrect further the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors including those described in this discussion many of which are beyond our control as a result we cannot be certain that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse current and potential stockholders are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions but instead are encouraged to utilize our entire publicly available mix of historical and forwardlooking information as well as other available information regarding us our products and services and the software industry when evaluating our prospective results of operations 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial market prices and interest rates as of december 31 2004 we had funds invested in a state and municipal bond mutual fund and auction rate municipal and corporate bonds all of which we accounted for in accordance with sfas no 115 “accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities” these investments were treated as availableforsale under sfas no 115 the carrying value of these investments approximates fair market value we are not exposed to any market risk related to the municipal bond mutual fund as we liquidated it in february 2005 due to the nature of the auction rate municipal and corporate bonds we are not subject to significant market rate risk we have no outstanding debt at december 31 2004 and we therefore are not subject to any interest rate risk 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure none 




 item 9a controls and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures — our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in securities exchange act rules 13a15e as of december 31 2004 based on such evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that as of december 31 2004 such disclosure controls and procedures were effective and designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the securities exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure internal control over financial reporting — during the quarter ended december 31 2004 there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as defined in securities exchange act rule 13a15f and 15d15f that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting management’s report on internal control over financial reporting — tyler’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in securities exchange act rule 13a15f tyler’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to tyler’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 34 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation management assessed the effectiveness of tyler’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control  integrated framework  based on our assessment we believe that as of december 31 2004 tyler’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 has been audited by ernst  young llp the independent registered public accounting firm who also audited tyler’s consolidated financial statements ernst  young’s attestation report on management’s assessment of tyler’s internal control over financial reporting appears on page f2 hereof

make local government more accessible to the public more responsive to the needs of citizens and more efficient in its operations we have a broad line of software products and services to address the information technology “it” needs of virtually every major area of operation for cities counties schools and other local government entities most of our customers have our software installed inhouse for customers who prefer not to physically acquire the software and hardware we provide outsourced hosting for some of our applications at one of our data centers through an applications service provider “asp” arrangement we provide professional it services to our customers including software and hardware installation data conversion training and at times product modifications in addition we are the nation’s largest provider of outsourced property appraisal services for taxing jurisdictions we also provide continuing customer support services to ensure proper product performance and reliability which provides us with longterm customer relationships and a significant base of recurring maintenance revenue tyler was founded in 1966 prior to early 1998 we operated as a diversified industrial conglomerate with diversified operations in various industrial retail and distribution businesses all of which have been sold in 1997 we embarked on a multiphase growth plan focused on serving the specialized information management needs of local governments nationwide in 1998 and 1999 we made a series of strategic acquisitions of companies in the local government it market in addition to our continuing operations in the software and services business described above we also operated from 1998 through 2000 a business segment focused on providing outsourced property records management for local governments and reselling related data in late 2000 we decided to dispose of the information and property records services segment in order to strengthen our balance sheet and allow us to focus our resources on the segment of business that we believe offers the greatest growth and profit opportunities we expect to continue to capitalize on these opportunities by leveraging our large national client base our longterm relationships with local government customers and our deep domain expertise in local government operations through the development of stateoftheart technologies and new nationally branded applications solutions we began in 2000 and are continuing to develop a new generation of software products some of which are based on ntier architecture sqlcompliant databases browser compatibility and componentbased technology market overview the state local and municipal government market is one of the largest and most decentralized it markets in the country consisting of all 50 states approximately 3200 counties and over 40000 municipalities and other agencies this market is also comprised of hundreds of various government agencies each with specialized delegated responsibilities and unique information management requirements traditionally local government bodies and agencies performed statemandated duties including property assessment record keeping road maintenance law enforcement administration of election and judicial functions and the provision of welfare assistance today a host of emerging and urgent issues are confronting local governments each of which demands a service response these areas include criminal justice and corrections administration and finance public safety health and human services and public works transfers of responsibility from the federal and state governments to county and municipal governments and agencies in these and other areas also place additional service and financial requirements on these local government units in addition constituents of local governments are increasingly demanding improved service and better access to information from public entities as a result local governments recognize the increasing value of information management systems and services to among other things improve revenue collection provide increased access to information and streamline delivery of services to their constituents local government bodies are now recognizing that “egovernment” is an additional responsibility for community development from integrated tax systems to integrated civil and criminal justice information systems many counties and cities have benefited significantly from the implementation of jurisdictionwide systems that allow different agencies or government offices to share data and provide a more comprehensive approach to information management many city and county governmental agencies also have unique individual information management requirements which must be tailored to the specific functions of each particular office 3 

many local governments also have difficulties attracting and retaining the staff necessary to support their it functions as a result they seek to establish longterm relationships with reliable providers of high quality it products and services such as tyler although local governments generally face budgetary constraints in their operations their primary revenue source is property tax which tends to be a relatively stable source of revenue in addition the acquisition of new technology typically enables local government to operate more efficiently and often provides a measurable return on investment that justifies the purchase of software and related services gartner dataquest currently estimates that state and local government spending for information technology products and services will grow from 414 billion in 2003 to 475 billion in 2006 the external services and software segments of the market in which we are primarily focused are expected to be the most rapidly growing areas of the local government it market products and services we provide a comprehensive and flexible suite of products and services that address the information technology needs of cities counties schools and other local government entities we derive our revenues from four primary sources  we design develop and market a broad range of software products to serve missioncritical “backoffice” functions of local governments our software applications are designed primarily for use on hardware supporting unixnt operating systems many of our software applications include internetaccessible solutions that allow for realtime public access to a variety of information or that allow the public to transact business with local governments via the internet our software products and services are generally grouped in four major areas  each of our core software systems consists of several fully integrated application modules for customers who acquire the software for use inhouse we generally license our systems under standard license agreements which provide the customer with a fullypaid nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software in some of the product areas such as financials and property appraisal we offer multiple solutions designed to meet the needs of different sized governments we also offer certain software products on an outsourced basis for customers who do not wish to maintain update and operate these systems or to make large upfront capital expenditures to implement these advanced technologies for these customers we either host the applications and data at one of our data centers or maintain the hardware and software at the client’s site customers typically pay monthly fees under multiyear contracts for these services historically we have had a higher concentration of sales and revenues in the second half of our fiscal year due to governmental budget and spending tendencies a description of our suite of products and services follows software licensing financial and city solutions our financial and city solutions products include modular fund accounting systems that can be tailored to meet the needs of virtually any government agency or notforprofit entity our financial systems include modules for general ledger budget preparation fixed 4

  when considering acquisition opportunities we generally focus on companies with strong management teams and employee bases and excellent customer relationships in december 2003 we acquired eden systems inc “eden” a provider of financial personnel and citizen services systems for local governments eden had 2003 revenues of approximately 118 million in december 2003 we also acquired certain assets of a business that provides forms software to users of some of our software products prior to these acquisitions our most recent acquisition included in our continuing operations was completed in november 1999 sales marketing and customers we market our products and services through direct sales and marketing personnel located throughout the united states other inhouse marketing staff focuses on addon sales professional services and support sales of new systems are typically generated from referrals from other governmental offices or departments within a county or municipality referrals from other local governments relationships established between sales representatives and county or local officials contacts at trade shows direct mailings and direct contact from prospects already familiar with us we are active in numerous national state county and local government associations and participate in annual meetings trade shows and educational events customers consist primarily of county and municipal agencies school districts and other local government offices in counties customers include the auditor treasurer tax assessorcollector county clerk district clerk county and district court judges probation officers sheriff and county appraiser at municipal government sites customers include directors from various departments including administration finance utilities public works code enforcement personnel purchasing taxation municipal court and police contracts for software products and services are generally implemented over periods of three months to one year with annually renewing maintenance and support update agreements thereafter although these agreements can be terminated by either us or the customer historically almost all support and maintenance agreements are automatically renewed annually contracts for appraisal outsourcing services are generally one to three years in duration during 2003 approximately 32 of our revenue was attributable to ongoing support and maintenance agreements competition we compete with numerous local regional and national firms that provide or offer some or many of the products and services provided by us most of these competitors are smaller companies that may be able to offer less expensive solutions than ours we also compete with national firms some of which have greater financial and technical resources than us including peoplesoft inc oracle corporation lawson software inc maximus inc affiliated computer services inc tier technologies inc sungard data systems inc and manatron inc we also occasionally compete with central internal information service departments of county or local governments which require us to persuade the enduser department to discontinue service by its own personnel and outsource 8 

the service to us we compete on a variety of factors including price service name recognition reputation technological capabilities and the ability to modify existing products and services to accommodate the individual requirements of the customer our ability to offer an integrated system of applications for several offices or departments is often a competitive strength local governmental units often are required to seek competitive proposals suppliers all computers peripherals printers scanners operating system software office automation software and other equipment necessary for the implementation and provision of our software systems and services are presently available from several thirdparty sources hardware is purchased on original equipment manufacturer or distributor terms at discounts from retail we have not experienced any significant supply problems backlog at december 31 2003 we estimated our sales backlog was approximately 1393 million compared to 891 million at december 31 2002 our sales backlog at december 31 2003 included approximately 119 million from our acquisition of eden in december 2003 the backlog represents contracts that have been signed but the products have not been delivered or the services performed as of yearend approximately 948 million of the backlog is expected to be installed or services are expected to be performed during 2004 intellectual property proprietary rights and licenses we regard certain features of our internal operations software and documentation as confidential and proprietary and rely on a combination of contractual restrictions trade secret laws and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property we generally do not rely on patents we believe that due to the rapid rate of technological change in the computer software industry trade secrets and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as knowledge ability and experience of our employees frequent product enhancements and timeliness and quality of support services we typically license our software products under exclusive license agreements which are generally nontransferable and have a perpetual term employees at december 31 2003 we had approximately 1200 employees appraisal outsourcing projects are periodic in nature and can be widely dispersed geographically we often hire temporary employees to assist in these projects whose term of employment generally ends with the project’s completion none of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to collective bargaining agreements we consider our relations with our employees to be positive internet website and availability of public filings we file annual quarterly current and other reports proxy statements and other information with the securities and exchange commission or sec pursuant to the securities exchange act you may read and copy any materials we file with the sec at the sec’s public reference room by calling the sec at 1800sec0330 the sec maintains an internet site that contains reports proxy and other information statements and other information regarding issuers including us that file electronically with the sec the address of site is httpwwwsecgov  we also maintain an internet site the address of which is wwwtylerworkscom  we make available free of charge through this site our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the exchange act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the sec our “code of business conduct and ethics” is also available on our web site we intend to satisfy the disclosure requirements regarding amendments to or waiver from a provision of our code of business conduct and ethics by posting such information on our web site 9

 critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the notes to the consolidated financial statements included as part of this annual report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including but not limited to those related to intangible assets bad debts and our service contracts we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position “sop” 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended by sop 984 and sop 989 as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants and in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” our revenues are derived from software licenses appraisal services and postcontract customer supportmaintenance services that typically range from installation training and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs for multiple element software arrangements which do not entail the performance of services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software we generally record revenue when the delivered products or performed services result in a legally enforceable claim we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts sales adjustments and estimated cost of product warranties which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized since most of our customers are governmental entities we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments occasionally customers may become dissatisfied with the functionality of the software products andor the quality of the services and request a reduction of the total contract price or similar concession while we engage in extensive product and service quality assurance programs and processes our allowances for these contract price reductions may need to be revised in the future in connection with our customer contracts and the adequacy of related allowances and measures of progress towards contract completion our project managers are charged with the responsibility to continually review the status of each customer on a specific contract basis also management at our corporate offices as well as at our operating companies review on at least a quarterly basis significant past due accounts receivable and the adequacy of related reserves events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts sales adjustments and estimated cost of product warranties may require revision include but are not limited to deterioration of a customer’s financial condition failure to manage our customer’s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products for those minimal number of our software arrangements that include customization of the software which is considered essential to its functionality and for substantially all of our real estate appraisal outsourcing projects we recognize revenue and profit as the work progresses using the percentageofcompletion method and the proportionate performance method of revenue recognition these methods rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue billings and collections and expected contract costs as well as measures of progress toward completion we believe reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs and progress applicable to various stages of a contract can be made at times we perform additional andor noncontractual services for little to no incremental fee to satisfy customer expectations if changes occur in delivery productivity or other factors used in developing our estimates of expected 15 

costs or revenues we revise our cost and revenue estimates and any revisions are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision first become known intangible assets and goodwill  our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge the cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value with the excess allocated to goodwill accordingly we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets including software customer base trade name and goodwill in addition we capitalize software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility on a specific software project certain of these intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives all intangible assets with definite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of goodwill is generally measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its fair value generally determined by estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset recoverability of other intangible assets is generally measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows the assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include but are not limited to a significant decrease in the market value of the business or asset acquired a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the business or asset acquired is used or a significant adverse change in the business climate in addition products capabilities or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or noncompetitive analysis of results of operations and other the following discussion compares the historical results of operations on a basis consistent with gaap for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 these results include the results of operations of our acquisition of eden from the date of its acquisition on december 2 2003 see note 2 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 2003 compared to 2002   revenues the following table sets forth for the periods indicated a yearoveryear comparison of the key components of our revenues  

software licenses  software license revenues for 2003 benefited from the successful first phase installation of our new odyssey case management system “odyssey courts” in the state of minnesota and lee county florida software license revenues from these two contracts totaled 34 million for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to none in the prior year in addition we increased sales of our financial and city solutions proprietary software products by approximately 200000 primarily by increasing sales and implementation staff and releasing a new version of one of our county tax products for our customers in the midwest our financial and city solutions software products automate accounting systems for cities counties school districts public utilities and notforprofit organizations however sales of thirdparty software licenses relating to our financial and city solutions products declined by approximately 700000 due to the sales of a onetime upgrade of the graphical user interface on some of our proprietary products in 2002 and decreased emphasis on sale of thirdparty licenses in 2003 in late 2003 we opened a new financial and city solutions sales office in california in an effort to further penetrate the west coast market we also experienced a decline in our property appraisal and tax software license revenues of approximately 750000 most of this decline related to one large property appraisal and tax software installation in the third quarter of 2002 our property appraisal and tax software license volume varies from period to period depending on the special needs and timing of our customers local government 16 

taxing entities normally reappraise real properties from time to time to update values for tax assessment purposes and to maintain equity in the taxing process while some of these taxing jurisdictions contract with our property appraisal and tax division to perform these reappraisals it is not always necessary for the customer to purchase new software in order to process the appraisals in some cases a customer may simply add smaller appraisal software modules to enhance the functionality of its existing software software services  higher software services revenues were attributable to the following factors   

 maintenance  we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and third party software the maintenance revenue increase was due to growth in our installed customer base and slightly higher rates on certain product lines appraisal services  the decrease is related to the completion and progression of several major appraisal contracts during 2003 we signed a new sixyear contract to provide nassau county new york board of assessors “nassau county extension” with updated property assessments and additional property appraisal and tax software the following table contains the appraisal services revenues for significant contracts for the periods presented  

  cost of revenues and gross margins the following table sets forth for the periods indicated a yearoveryear comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues and gross margins and those components stated as a percentage of related revenues  

cost of software license revenues  in september 2003 we began amortizing the software development costs of our odyssey courts product as it was complete and ready for general release to the public once a product is released we begin to expense the costs associated with its development over the estimated useful life of the product amortization expense is determined on a productbyproduct basis at an annual rate not less than straightline basis over the product’s estimated life development costs consist mainly of personnel costs such as salary and benefits paid to our developers rent for related office space and capitalized interest costs the amortization for odyssey courts is calculated using the straightline method of amortization over an estimated fiveyear useful life in 2003 we recorded amortization expense of approximately 559000 related to odyssey courts for the period september 1 2003 general release date through december 31 2003 in addition during 2002 we had several smaller products in the development stage released in late 2002 and early 2003 that contributed to the increase in amortization expense cost of software services and maintenance revenues  cost of software services and maintenance primarily consists of expenses such as personnel costs related to installation of our software licenses conversion of customer data training customer personnel and support activities the increase in costs is consistent with higher software services and maintenance revenues for the same periods although software services and maintenance revenues grew at a more rapid rate than the cost of those revenues which is reflective of more efficient utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale cost of appraisal services revenues  the decrease in the cost of appraisal services revenues is consistent with the decrease in appraisal services revenues we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects whose term of employment generally ends with the projects’ completion however key appraisal personnel and management were retained in anticipation of new appraisal contracts which contributed to a 3 decline in appraisal gross margins compared to 2002 gross margin our overall gross margin improved over the prior year due to higher software services and maintenance revenues without a corresponding increase in related personnel costs reflecting a more efficient utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale improvements in software services and maintenance gross margin were slightly offset by declines in software license gross margin due to amortization of new product releases and declines in the appraisal services gross margin   selling general and administrative expenses the following table sets forth for the periods indicated a yearoveryear comparison of our selling general and administrative expenses  

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in 2003 compared to 2002 is a result of the following factors    amortization of acquisition intangibles the following table sets forth for the periods indicated a yearoveryear comparison of amortization of acquisition intangibles  

the decrease in amortization from 2002 is related to certain of our acquisition intangibles becoming fully amortized during 2003 acquisition intangibles are composed of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that is allocated to acquired and amortizable software customer base and trade name with the remainder allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization the estimated useful lives of acquired software customer base and trade name are 3 to 5 years 20 to 25 years and 5 to 25 years respectively estimated annual amortization expense relating to acquisition intangibles for the next five years is as follows in thousands  

  realized gain on sale of investment in hte inc on march 25 2003 we received cash proceeds of 393 million in connection with a transaction to sell all of our 56 million shares of hte inc “hte” common stock to sungard data systems inc for 700 cash per share our original cost basis in the hte shares was 158 million after transaction and other costs we recorded a gross realized gain of 232 million 162 million or 036 per diluted share after income taxes of 70 million for the year ended december 31 2003 see note 6 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements   other income expense net the following table sets forth for the periods indicated a yearoveryear comparison of the key components of other income expense net  

during the year ended december 31 2002 we incurred approximately 704000 of legal and other costs associated with legal matters concerning various tort claims hte alleged against us and hte’s attempted redemption of our 56 million shares for 130 per share 19 

in september 2002 hte released us from all tort claims and a court declared hte’s reported redemption of our shares was invalid in march 2003 we sold for cash our entire investment in hte for 700 per share the increase in interest income is related to higher invested cash balances including 393 million in cash received upon the sale of our investment in hte in late march 2003 proceeds from the exercise of stock options as well as cash generated from operations the cash received from the sale of hte was offset by payments totaling 241 million for repurchase of a total of approximately 60 million shares of our common stock in a modified dutch auction tender offer in may 2003 and on the open market throughout 2003 in addition we made a cash payment of approximately 121 million net of cash acquired for two acquisitions made in december 2003 the most significant of which is eden the increase in interest expense is related to letter of credit fees our bank has issued outstanding letters of credit as of december 31 2003 totaling 75 million under our credit agreement to secure surety bonds which are required by some of our customer contracts during november 2003 we purchased a certificate of deposit in the amount of 75 million to collateralize the outstanding letters of credit interest expense is net of capitalized interest costs related to capitalized software development costs of 63000 and 269000 for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively   income tax provision the following table sets forth for the periods indicated a yearoveryear comparison of our income tax provision  

the 2003 income tax provision includes income tax expense of approximately 70 million relating to the realized gain from the sale of our investment in hte after reduction in valuation allowance related to the utilization of a capital loss carryforward amounting to 11 million on a taxeffected basis for the year ended december 31 2003 we had an effective income tax rate of 38 excluding the effect of the hte gain the effective income tax rates for 2003 compared to 2002 were different from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of 35 primarily due to the utilization of the capital loss carryforward in 2003 state income taxes and nondeductible meals and entertainment costs   discontinued operations one of our nonoperating subsidiaries was involved in various claims for workrelated injuries and physical conditions relating to a formerlyowned subsidiary that we sold in 1995 on december 23 2003 we paid 148 million to the swan asbestos and silica trust in full and final release from all liability for claims associated with the onceowned foundry “swan matter” as a result of the release any claimant is barred from asserting any such claim either now or in the future against tyler or its affected affiliates see note 16 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements during the year ended december 31 2003 the gain on disposal of discontinued operations of 424000 primarily resulted because we fully settled the swan matter at an amount less than initially recorded and certain aspects of the settlement were conducted in a beneficial tax manner accordingly we recognized for the first time certain tax benefits associated with payments on behalf of the swan matter   net income the following table sets forth for the periods indicated a yearoveryear comparison of our net income earnings per diluted share income from continuing operations per diluted share and diluted weighted average shares outstanding  

net income for the year ended december 31 2003 included a 162 million realized gain after income taxes relating to the sale of our investment in hte which has a diluted earnings per share effect of 036 per share during 2003 we repurchased approximately 60 million shares of our common stock through our modified dutch auction tender offer and purchases on the open market had we not executed those repurchases our net income per share including the gain on the sale of our investment in hte for the year ended december 31 2003 would have been reduced by 007 per diluted share 2002 compared to 2001   revenues the following table sets forth for the periods indicated a yearoveryear comparison of the key components of our revenues  

software licenses during 2002 we recognized approximately 24 million in license revenues from four customers for property appraisal and tax appraisal software while we recorded minimal license revenues from appraisal software in 2001 the remainder of the increase in software license revenues was related to expansion of our financial and city solutions software products into the midwest and the western united states and was aided by the release of several new financial and city solutions products and enhancements software services the increase in software services is primarily related to higher software license sales in addition software services revenues for 2002 included approximately 19 million for services performed under an 110 million contract signed with the state of minnesota in july 2002 to install our new odyssey court case management system the minnesota contract includes both software license and software services but no license revenues were recognized under the contract in 2002 maintenance  the maintenance revenue increase was due to growth in our installed customer base and slightly higher rates during 2001 we received and recorded as revenue a onetime settlement of approximately 650000 from a third party provider of maintenance services relating to past services excluding this settlement maintenance revenue increased approximately 13 for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to the prior year appraisal services the increase in appraisal services revenues compared to the prior year was primarily related to our contract with lake county indiana to provide professional services and technology to reassess real property which was first awarded in december 2001 during 2002 appraisal services revenue also included 121 million of appraisal revenue related to our contract with the nassau county new york board of assessors “nassau county” which was comparable to the amount recognized in 2001 substantially all of the work related to nassau county contract had been completed as of december 31 2002 21 

  cost of revenues and gross margins the following table sets forth for the periods indicated a yearoveryear comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues and gross margins and those components stated as a percentage of related revenues  

cost of software license revenues  the increase in cost of software licenses is primarily due to higher amortization expense of software development costs in 2001 we had several products in the development stage which were released beginning in the third quarter of 2001 and we began to expense the related development costs at that time cost of software service and maintenance revenues  the increase in cost of software services and maintenance revenues is consistent with the higher software services and maintenance revenues for the same period although software services and maintenance revenues grew at a higher rate than the cost of those revenues which is reflective of more efficient utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale cost of appraisal services revenues the increase in cost of appraisal services revenues is consistent with the increase in appraisal services revenues which also rose 7 compared to the prior year gross margin our 2002 gross margin benefited from a product mix that included more software license revenues and higher maintenance revenues than the prior year software license revenues have lower associated costs than other revenues such as software and appraisal services third party software and hardware in addition utilization of our personnel that provide services and support has improved which has increased our overall gross profit the increase in our gross profit was offset slightly by higher software development amortization during 2002   selling general and administrative expenses the following table sets forth for the periods indicated a yearoveryear comparison of selling general and administrative expenses  

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was related primarily to higher costs with respect to sales commissions and increases in health and other insurance expenses   amortization of acquisition intangibles the following table sets forth for the periods indicated a yearoveryear comparison of amortization of acquisition intangibles

our effective income tax rate in 2002 and 2001 exceeded the federal statutory rate of 35 due primarily to the net effect of state income taxes and items that are nondeductible for federal income tax purposes including certain non taxdeductible goodwill amortization in periods prior to 2002   discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2002 we recorded a gain on disposal of discontinued operations after income taxes of 18 million and for the year ended december 31 2001 we recorded a loss on disposal of discontinued operations after income taxes of 3000 during the year ended december 31 2002 the internal revenue service issued temporary regulations that in effect allowed us to deduct for tax purposes losses attributable to the march 1999 sale of our automotive parts subsidiary that were previously not allowed the tax benefit of allowing the deduction of this loss amounted to approximately 970000 in addition we renegotiated a note receivable and certain contingent consideration in connection with a subsidiary sold in 2001 and received proceeds of approximately 846000 in 2002 we initially assigned no value for accounting purposes to the note receivable and contingent consideration when the loss on the disposal of the discontinued operation was first established in 2000 and when the note was first received in 2001 in addition we entered into an agreement in the fourth quarter of 2002 to settle the swan matter for an amount that was approximately 200000 less than the liability initially established for this matter the aggregate effects of these events net of the related tax effects and other minor adjustments to the reserve for discontinued operations resulted in a credit to discontinued operations of 18 million in 2002 23

other accounting pronouncements in january 2003 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued interpretation no 46 “fin 46” “consolidation of variable interest entities” an entity is subject to the consolidation rules of fin 46 and is referred to as a variable interest entity “vie” if the entity’s equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support fin 46 has different application dates depending on when the vie was created we do not currently have any vies that need to be consolidated or disclosed however if we enter into any such arrangements with a vie in the future our financial position results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted financial condition and liquidity as of december 31 2003 our balance in cash and cash equivalents was 103 million and we had shortterm investments of 117 million compared to a cash balance of 137 million at december 31 2002 in addition we had restricted cash of 75 million invested in a certificate of deposit at december 31 2003 cash and shortterm investments increased primarily due to the 393 million cash received in march 2003 as consideration in connection with the transaction to sell our 56 million shares of hte common stock to sungard data systems inc at december 31 2003 our days sales outstanding “dsos” were 88 compared to dsos of 85 at december 31 2002 the increase in dsos is due primarily to increased receivables at december 31 2003 resulting from the inclusion of receivable balances in connection with an acquisition in december 2003 and the timing of billings dsos are determined based on accounts receivable divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by 360 days on march 5 2002 we entered into a 100 million revolving credit agreement with a bank which matures january 1 2005 our borrowings are limited to 80 of eligible accounts receivable and interest is charged at either the prime rate or at the london interbank offered rate plus a margin of 3 the credit agreement is secured by our personal property and the common stock of our operating subsidiaries the credit agreement is also guaranteed by our operating subsidiaries in addition the credit agreement contains covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial conditions and prohibits us from making certain investments advances cash dividends or loans as of december 31 2003 we were in compliance with those covenants as of december 31 2003 our bank has issued outstanding letters of credit totaling 75 million under our credit agreement to secure surety bonds required by some of our customer contracts during november 2003 we purchased a certificate of deposit in the amount of 75 million to collateralize the outstanding letters of credit our borrowing base under the credit agreement is limited by the amount of eligible receivables at december 31 2003 we had no outstanding bank borrowings under the credit agreement and all outstanding letters of credit were collateralized with a certificate of deposit thus we had an available borrowing base of 98 million in may 2003 we completed a modified dutch auction tender offer whereby we purchased 51 million shares of our common stock at a cash purchase price of 400 per share and incurred transaction costs of approximately 150000 for a total cost of 206 million in addition during 2003 we repurchased in the open market 912800 shares for an aggregate purchase price of 35 million subsequent to december 31 2003 and through february 20 2004 we have repurchased another 80600 shares for an aggregate purchase price of 784000 as of february 20 2004 we have a remaining authorization from our board of directors to repurchase up to 19 million shares of our common stock 24 

in december 2003 we acquired 95 of the outstanding stock of eden for approximately 140 million comprised of 121 million of cash including cash acquired of 21 million and 19 million of our common stock cash paid also includes a payment in cash of 210000 made after december 31 2003 in addition in december 2003 we acquired certain assets of a company that provides forms software to users of some of our software products for 24 million of cash and approximately 500000 of our common stock in august 2003 we received 127000 to fully settle a promissory note the promissory note was received as consideration for the disposition of a subsidiary in may 2001 that was included in our discontinued information and property records services segment on march 28 2003 we retired an outstanding 25 million 10 promissory note payable the note was originally due in january 2005 and required quarterly interest payments we made estimated federal income tax payments in the amount of 50 million in june 2003 and 750000 in december 2003 the june 2003 payment was made primarily due to the 232 million realized gain on the sale of our investment in hte common stock and also because of the increase in our estimated taxable income for the tax year ended december 31 2003 during 2003 we received 17 million from the exercise of options to purchase 554000 shares of our common stock under our employee stock option plan during 2003 we made capital expenditures of 86 million including 68 million for software development costs the other expenditures related to computer equipment and expansions related to internal growth capital expenditures were funded from cash generated from operations excluding acquisitions we anticipate that 2004 capital spending will be approximately 83 million 57 million of which will be related to software development capital spending in 2004 is expected to be funded from existing cash balances and cash flows from operations as part of the plan of reorganization of swan transportation company one of our nonoperating subsidiaries we had agreed to contribute approximately 15 million over the next three years to a trust that was set up as a part of the reorganization in the third quarter of 2003 we reached an agreement to revise the funding arrangement to fully satisfy our funding obligations with a lump sum payment of 148 million in cash which was made on december 23 2003 see note 16 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements from time to time we will engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates in order to pursue such opportunities which could require significant commitments of capital we may be required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive securities in the future no assurance can be given as to our future acquisition opportunities and how such opportunities will be financed in the absence of future acquisitions of other businesses we believe our current cash balances and expected future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital capital expenditures and other activities through the next twelve months if operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our needs we may borrow under our credit agreement we primarily lease offices as well as transportation computer and other equipment used in our continuing operations under noncancelable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through 2013 most leases contain renewal options and some contain purchase options following are the future obligations under noncancelable leases at december 31 2003 in thousands  

it is not our usual business practice to enter into offbalance sheet arrangements moreover it is not our normal policy to issue guarantees to third parties as of december 31 2003 we have no material purchase commitments except for the operating lease commitments listed above 25 

capitalization at december 31 2003 our capitalization consisted of 1179 million of shareholders’ equity factors that may affect future results and market price of our stock an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk investors evaluating our company should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this annual report any of the following factors could materially harm our business operating results and financial condition additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business operating results and financial condition this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report we may make forwardlooking statements from time to time both written and oral we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forwardlooking statements our actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forwardlooking statements due to a number of factors including those set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report a decline in information technology spending may result in a decrease in our revenues or lower our growth rate a decline in the demand for information technology among our current and prospective customers may result in decreased revenues or a lower growth rate for us because our sales depend in part on our customers’ level of funding for new or additional information technology systems and services moreover demand for our solutions may be reduced by a decline in overall demand for computer software and services the current technology recession and decline in overall technology spending terrorist activity and threats of hostilities in the middle east and asia may cause our customers to reduce or eliminate information technology spending and cause price erosion for our solutions which would substantially reduce the number of new software licenses we sell and the average sales price for these licenses because of these market and economic conditions we believe there will continue to be uncertainty in the level of demand for our products and services accordingly we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase or maintain our revenues we may experience fluctuations in quarterly revenue that could adversely impact our stock price and our operating results our actual revenues in a quarter could fall below expectations which could lead to a decline in our stock price our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter revenues from license fees in any quarter depend substantially upon our contracting activity and our ability to recognize revenues in that quarter in accordance with our revenue recognition policies our quarterly revenue may fluctuate and may be difficult to forecast for a variety of reasons including the following  fluctuation in our quarterly revenues may adversely affect our operating results in each fiscal quarter our expense levels operating costs and hiring plans are based on projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed if our actual revenues fall below expectations we could experience a reduction in operating results 26 

as with other software vendors we may be required to delay revenue recognition into future periods which could adversely impact our operating results we have in the past had to and in the future may have to defer revenue recognition for license fees due to several factors including whether  because of the factors listed above and other specific requirements under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states for software revenue recognition we must have very precise terms in our license agreements in order to recognize revenue when we initially deliver and install software or perform services negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions can extend the sales cycle and sometimes we do not obtain terms and conditions that permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery or even as work on the project is completed increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins and adversely affect our operating results we realize lower margins on software and appraisal service revenues than on license revenue the majority of our contracts involve both the license of software and the provision of professional services therefore an increase in the percentage of software service and appraisal service revenue compared to license revenue could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and could adversely affect operating results selling products and services into the public sector poses unique challenges we derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of software and services to state county and city governments other municipal agencies and other public entities we expect that sales to public sector customers will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues in the future we face many risks and challenges associated with contracting with governmental entities including  each of these risks is outside our control if we fail to adequately adapt to these risks and uncertainties our financial performance could be adversely affected 27 

the open bidding process for governmental contracts creates uncertainty in predicting future contract awards many governmental agencies purchase products and services through an open bidding process generally a governmental entity will publish an established list of requirements requesting potential vendors to propose solutions for the established requirements to respond successfully to these requests for proposals we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract the time required to establish operations for the proposed client and the likely terms of any other third party proposals submitted we cannot guarantee that we will win any bids in the future through the request for proposal process or that any winning bids will ultimately result in contracts on favorable terms our failure to secure contracts through the open bidding process or to secure such contracts on favorable terms may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations fixed price contracts may affect our profits some of our present contracts are on a fixedpriced basis which can lead to various risks including  if we do not adequately assess these and other risks we may be subject to cost overruns and penalties which may harm our business financial condition or results of operations we face significant competition from other vendors and potential new entrants into our markets we believe we are a leading provider of integrated solutions for the public sector however we face competition from a variety of software vendors that offer products and services similar to those offered by us as well as from companies offering to develop custom software we compete on the basis of a number of factors including  we believe the market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors that vary in size primary computer platforms and overall product scope our competitors include the consulting divisions of national and regional accounting firms publicly held companies that focus on selected segments of the public sector market and a significant number of smaller privately held companies certain competitors have greater technical marketing and financial resources than us we cannot assure you that such competitors will not develop products or offer services that are superior to our products or services or that achieve greater market acceptance we also compete with internal centralized information service departments of governmental entities which require us to persuade the enduser to stop the internal service and outsource to us in addition our customers may elect in the future to provide information management services internally through new or existing departments which will reduce the market for our services we could face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the public sector software application market and new products and technologies are introduced increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share in addition current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with thirdparties thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share further competitive pressures could require us to reduce the price of our software licenses and related services we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the failure to do so would have material adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition 28 

we must respond to rapid technological changes to be competitive the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards in computer hardware and software technology changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result our future success will depend in part upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products and develop and introduce in a timely manner or acquire new products that keep pace with technological developments satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and costeffective manner further we cannot assure you that the products capabilities or technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive if we are unable to develop or acquire on a timely and costeffective basis new software products or enhancements to existing products or if such new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance our business operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected our failure to properly manage growth could adversely affect our business we have expanded our operations rapidly since february 1998 when we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector we intend to continue expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities this rapid growth places a significant demand on management and operational resources in order to manage growth effectively we must implement and improve our operational systems procedures and controls on a timely basis we must also identify hire train and manage key managerial and technical personnel if we fail to implement these systems or employ and retain such qualified personnel our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected in addition a significant portion of our growth has resulted from strategic acquisitions in new product and geographic markets although our future focus will be on internal growth we will continue to identify and pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances with suitable candidates our future success will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate past and future acquisitions and other strategic alliances into our operations acquisitions may involve a number of special risks including diversion of management’s attention failure to retain key acquired personnel unanticipated events or circumstances legal liabilities and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we conduct due diligence reviews of potential acquisition candidates we may not identify all material liabilities or risks related to acquisition candidates there can be no assurance that any such strategic acquisitions or alliances will be accomplished on favorable terms or will result in profitable operations we may be unable to hire integrate and retain qualified personnel our continued success will depend upon the availability and performance of our key management sales marketing customer support and product development personnel the loss of key management or technical personnel could adversely affect us we believe that our continued success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract integrate and retain such personnel we have at times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel competition for qualified software development sales and other personnel is intense and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel we may experience difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy we occasionally expand our business through the acquisition of complementary companies we cannot however make any assurances that we will be able to identify any potential acquisition candidates or complete any additional acquisitions on terms that are acceptable to us in addition we cannot assure you that any future acquisitions will be successfully integrated or will be advantageous to us we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights many of our product and service offerings incorporate proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of contracts copyrights and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology we cannot be certain that we have taken all appropriate steps to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property in addition there has been significant litigation in the united states in recent years involving intellectual property rights we are not currently involved in any material intellectual property litigation we may however be a party to intellectual property litigation in the future to protect our proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights further we cannot 29 

assure you that third parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us in the future with respect to current or future products any claims or litigation with or without merit could be timeconsuming and result in costly litigation and diversion of management’s attention further any claims and litigation could cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements such royalty or licensing arrangements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all thus litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations regardless of the final outcome of such litigation our products are complex and as such we run the risk of errors or defects with new product introductions or enhancements software products as complex as those developed by us may contain errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released although we have not experienced material adverse effects resulting from any such defects or errors to date we cannot assure you that material defects and errors will not be found after commencement of product shipments any such defects could result in loss of revenues or delay market acceptance our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims it is possible however that the limitation of liability provisions contained in our license agreements may not be effective as a result of existing or future federal state or local laws ordinances or judicial decisions although we maintain errors and omissions and general liability insurance and we try to structure our contracts to include limitations on liability we cannot assure you that a successful claim could not be made or would not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our application service provider strategy has yet to gain widespread acceptance some businesses choose to access enterprise software applications through application service providers or asps which are businesses that host applications and provide access to software on a subscription basis the public sector market for asp solutions is new and unproven acceptance of our asp model depends upon the ability and willingness of different governmental entities to accept and implement asp solutions our clients have expressed security and privacy concerns with the asp model including a concern regarding the confidential nature of the information and transactions available from and conducted with governments and concerns regarding offsite storage of such information we have limited experience selling our solutions through asps and may not be successful in generating revenue from this distribution channel changes in the insurance markets may affect our ability to win some contract awards and may lead to increased expenses some of our customers primarily those for our property appraisal services require that we secure performance bonds before they will select us as their vendor the number of qualified highrated insurance companies that offer performance bonds has decreased in recent years while the costs associated with securing these bonds has increased dramatically in addition we are generally required to issue a letter of credit as security for the issuance of a performance bond each letter of credit we issue without corresponding cash collateral reduces our borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit agreement we cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure such performance bonds in the future on terms that are favorable to us if at all our inability to obtain performance bonds on favorable terms or at all could impact our future ability to win some contract awards particularly large property appraisal services contracts which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations recent volatility in the stock markets increasing shareholder litigation the adoption of expansive legislation that redefines corporate controls in particular legislation adopted to prevent future corporate and accounting scandals as well as other factors have recently led to significant increases in premiums for directors’ and officers’ liability insurance the number of insurers offering directors and officers insurance at competitive rates has also decreased in recent years we cannot predict when the insurance market for such coverage will stabilize if at all the continued volatility of the insurance market may result in future increases in our general and administrative expenses which may adversely affect future operating results compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 new securities and exchange commission regulations and new york stock exchange rules are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities 30 

our stock price may be volatile the market price of our common stock may be volatile and may be significantly affected by many different factors some examples of factors that can have a significant impact on our stock price include  in addition the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for the common stock of technology companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company we cannot assure you that similar litigation will not occur in the future with respect to us such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition historically we have not paid dividends on our common stock we have not declared or paid a cash dividend since we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector in february 1998 our credit agreement restricts our ability to pay cash dividends we intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future provisions in our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law could deter takeover attempts our board of directors may issue up to 1000000 shares of preferred stock and may determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting and conversion rights of these shares of preferred stock these determinations may be made without any further vote or action by our stockholders the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock in addition some provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and of the delaware general corporation law could also delay prevent or make more difficult a merger tender offer or proxy contest involving us financial outlook from time to time in press releases and otherwise we may publish forecasts or other forwardlooking statements regarding our results including estimated revenues or net earnings any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties and as a matter of course any number of them may prove to be incorrect further the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors including those described in this discussion many of which are beyond our control as a result we cannot be certain that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse current and potential stockholders are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions but instead are encouraged to utilize our entire publicly available mix of historical and forwardlooking information as well as other available information regarding us our products and services and the software industry when evaluating our prospective results of operations 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are not exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates currently we have funds invested in a state and municipal bond mutual fund and a fixed income securities mutual fund we account for these investments in accordance with sfas no 115 “accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities” these investments are treated as availableforsale under 31 

sfas no 115 the carrying value of these investments approximates fair market value our investments are subject to market risk which is the risk that our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected due to movements in market rates and prices assuming current levels of investments based on a hypothetical tenpercent decrease in the market value of the aforementioned funds the total fair value of the funds would decrease approximately 12 million

information management solutions and services for local governments we partner
with clients to make local government more accessible to the public more

have a broad line of software products and services to address the information
technology it needs of virtually every major area of operation for cities
counties schools and other local government entities most of our customers
have our software installed inhouse for customers who prefer not to physically

applications at one of our data centers through an applications service provider
asp arrangement we provide professional it services to our customers

times product modifications in addition we are the nations largest provider

provide continuing customer support services to ensure proper product

relationships and a significant base of recurring maintenance revenue

tyler was founded in 1966 prior to early 1998 we operated as a diversified
industrial conglomerate with diversified operations in various industrial
retail and distribution businesses all of which have been sold in 1997 we
embarked on a multiphase growth plan focused on serving the specialized
information management needs of local governments nationwide in 1998 and 1999
we made a series of strategic acquisitions of leading companies in the local
government it market

in addition to our continuing operations in the software and services business
described above we also operated from 1998 through 2000 a business segment
focused on providing outsourced property records management for local
governments and reselling related data in late 2000 we decided to dispose of
the information and property records services segment in order to strengthen our
balance sheet and allow us to focus our resources on the segment of business
that we believe offers the greatest growth and profit opportunities we expect
to continue to capitalize on these opportunities by leveraging our large
national client base our longterm relationships with local government
customers and our deep domain expertise in local government operations through
the development of stateoftheart technologies and new nationally branded
applications solutions we began in 2000 and are continuing to develop a new
generation of some of our software products based on ntier architecture
sqlcompliant databases browser compatibility and componentbased technology

our historical revenues from continuing operations have grown from 234 million
in 1998 to 1339 million in 2002 in addition to growth through acquisitions
our business units have experienced significant internal growth during this
period on a pro forma basis revenues from continuing operations have grown
from 837 million in 1998 to 1339 million in 2002

market overview

the state local and municipal government market is one of the largest and most
decentralized it markets in the country consisting of all 50 states
approximately 3200 counties and over 40000 municipalities and other agencies
this market is also comprised of hundreds of various government agencies each
with specialized delegated responsibilities and unique information management
requirements

traditionally local government bodies and agencies performed statemandated
duties including property assessment record keeping road maintenance law
enforcement administration of election and judicial functions and the
provision of welfare assistance today a host of emerging and urgent issues are
confronting local governments each of which demands a service response these
areas include criminal justice and corrections administration and finance
public safety health and human services and public works transfers of
responsibility from the federal and state governments to county and municipal
governments and agencies in these and other areas also place additional service
and financial requirements on these local government units in addition
constituents of local governments are increasingly demanding improved service
and better access to information from public entities as a result local
governments recognize the increasing value of information management systems and
services to among other things improve revenue collection provide increased
access to information and streamline delivery of services to their
constituents local government bodies are now recognizing that egovernment is
an additional responsibility for community development from integrated tax
systems to integrated civil and criminal justice information systems many
counties and cities have benefited significantly from the implementation of
jurisdictionwide systems that allow different agencies or government offices to
share data

                                       3

and provide a more comprehensive approach to information management many city
and county governmental agencies also have unique individual information
management requirements which must be tailored to the specific functions of
each particular office

many local governments also have difficulties attracting and retaining the staff
necessary to support their it functions as a result they seek to establish
longterm relationships with reliable providers of high quality it products and
services such as tyler

although local governments generally face budgetary constraints in their
operations the primary revenue source of local government is property tax
which tends to be a relatively stable source of revenue in addition the
acquisition of technology typically enables local government to operate more
efficiently and often provides a measurable return on investment that justifies

we also offer certain software products on an outsourced basis for customers who
do not wish to maintain update and operate these systems or to make large
upfront capital expenditures to implement these advanced technologies for
these customers we either host the applications and data at one of our data
centers or maintain the hardware and software at the clients site customers
typically pay monthly fees under multiyear contracts for these services

historically we have had a higher concentration of sales in the second half of
our fiscal year due to governmental budget and spending tendencies

appraisal services

we are the nations largest provider of real property appraisal outsourcing
services for local government taxing authorities these services include

                 the physical inspection of all commercial and residential

                 community education regarding the assessment process and

                 arbitration between taxpayers and the assessing jurisdiction

local government taxing entities normally reappraise real properties from time
to time to update values for tax assessment purposes and to maintain equity in
the taxing process in some jurisdictions reassessment cycles are mandated by
law in others they are discretionary while some taxing jurisdictions perform
reappraisals inhouse many local governments outsource this function because of
its cyclical nature and because of the specialized knowledge and expertise
requirements associated with it our business unit that provides appraisal
outsourcing services to local governments has been in this business since 1938

in some instances we also sell property tax andor appraisal software products
in connection with appraisal outsourcing contracts while other customers may
only engage us to provide appraisal services appraisal outsourcing services are
somewhat seasonal in nature to the extent that winter weather conditions reduce
the productivity of data collection activities in connection with those
projects

following the implementation of our software systems we provide ongoing
software support services to assist our customers in operating the systems and
to periodically update the software support is provided over the phone to
customers through help desks staffed by our customer support representatives
for more complicated issues our staff with the customers permission can log
on to customers systems remotely we maintain our customers software largely
through releases that contain improvements and incremental additions along with
updates necessary because of legislative or regulatory changes

virtually all of our software customers contract for maintenance and support
from us which provides a significant source of recurring revenue we generally
provide maintenance and support under annual contracts with a typical fee based
on the software products license fee these fees can be increased annually and
may also increase as new license fees increase maintenance and support fees are
generally paid in advance for the entire maintenance contract period most
maintenance contracts automatically renew unless we or the customer gives notice
of termination prior to expiration similar support is provided to our asp
customers and is included in their monthly overall fees

strategy

our objective is to grow our revenue and earnings internally supplemented by
focused strategic acquisitions the key components of our business strategy are
to

                 provide high quality valueadded products and services to our
                  clients we compete on the basis of among other things
                  delivering to customers our deep domain expertise in local
                  government operations through the highest value products and
                  services in the market we believe we have achieved a
                  reputation as a premium product and service provider to the
                  local government market

                 continue to expand our product and service offerings while we
                  already have what we believe to be the broadest line of
                  software products for local governments we continually
                  upgrade our core software applications and expand our
                  complementary product and service offerings to respond to
                  technological advancements and the changing needs of our
                  clients for example we offer solutions that allow the public
                  to access data and conduct transactions with local
                  governments such as paying traffic tickets property taxes
                  and utility bills via the internet we believe that the
                  addition of such features enhances the market appeal of our
                  core products in 2001 we also began offering certain of our
                  software products in an asp environment a delivery model that
                  we believe will have increasing appeal to local governments
                  and that will be expanded to include more applications we
                  have also increased our offerings of consulting and business
                  process reengineering services

                 leverage a core technology framework across multiple product
                  development efforts we have developed a core technology
                  framework upon which we intend to develop a new generation of
                  a number of products by leveraging the core framework which
                  is based on an ntier browserbased architecture for the
                  development of multiple products we believe we can develop
                  newgeneration products more efficiently and at a lower total
                  cost in addition utilizing a core framework is also expected
                  to help us bring new products to market more rapidly by
                  having more products built on a common technology framework
                  we expect to enhance our crossselling opportunities and be
                  able to provide maintenance and other services more
                  efficiently

                 expand our customer base we seek to establish longterm
                  relationships with new customers primarily through our sales
                  and marketing efforts while we currently have customers in 49
                  states canada and puerto rico not all of our product lines
                  have nationwide geographic penetration we intend to expand
                  into new geographic markets by adding sales staff and
                  targeting marketing efforts by product in those areas we also
                  intend to continue to expand our customer base to include
                  larger governments while our traditional market focus has
                  primarily been on small and midsized governments our
                  increased size and market presence together with the
                  technological advances and improved scalability of certain of
                  our products are allowing us to achieve success in selling to
                  larger customers

                 expand our existing customer relationships our existing
                  customer base of nearly 6000 local government offices offers
                  significant opportunities for additional sales of it products
                  and services that we currently offer but that existing
                  customers do not fully utilize addon sales to existing
                  customers typically involve lower sales and marketing expenses
                  than sales to new customers

                 grow recurring revenue we have a large recurring revenue base
                  from maintenance and support with an annual run rate in
                  excess of 40 million we have historically experienced very
                  low customer turnover less than 1 annually for our major
                  software business units and recurring revenues continue to
                  grow as the installed customer base increases in addition
                  since the beginning of 2001 we have established a growing
                  recurring revenue stream from asp hosting and other similar
                  services

                 maximize economies of scale and take advantage of financial
                  leverage in our business we seek to develop and maintain a
                  large client base to create economies of scale enabling us to
                  provide valueadded products and services to our customers
                  while expanding our operating margins because we sell
                  primarily offtheshelf software increased sales of the
                  same products result in incrementally higher gross margins in
                  addition we believe that we have a marketing and
                  administrative infrastructure in place that we can leverage to
                  accommodate significant growth without proportionately
                  increasing selling general and administrative expenses

                 attract and retain highly qualified employees we believe that
                  the depth and quality of our operating management and staff is
                  one of our significant strengths and that the ability to
                  retain such employees is crucial to our continued growth and
                  success we believe that our stable management team financial
                  strength and growth opportunities as well as our leadership
                  position in the local government market enhance our
                  attractiveness as an employer for highly skilled employees

                 pursue selected strategic acquisitions while we expect to
                  grow primarily internally we may from time to time
                  selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that provide us with
                  one or more of the following

                          products and services to complement our existing
                           offerings

                          entry into new markets related to local governments
                           and

                          new customers andor geographic expansion

when considering acquisition opportunities we generally focus on companies with
strong management teams and employee bases and excellent customer relationships
our most recent acquisition included in our continuing operations was completed
in november 1999

sales marketing and customers

we market our products and services through direct sales and marketing personnel
located throughout the united states other inhouse marketing staff focus on
addon sales professional services and support

sales of new systems are typically generated from referrals from other
governmental offices or departments within a county or municipality referrals
from other local governments relationships established between sales
representatives and county or local officials contacts at trade shows direct
mailings and direct contact from prospects already familiar with us we are
active in numerous state county and local government associations and
participate in annual meetings trade shows and educational events

customers consist primarily of county and municipal agencies school districts
and other local government offices in counties customers include the auditor
treasurer tax assessorcollector county clerk district clerk county and
district court judges probation officers sheriff and county appraiser at
municipal government sites customers include directors from various
departments including administration finance utilities public works code
enforcement personnel purchasing taxation municipal court and police in
2002 one customer accounted for approximately 10 of our total revenues
contracts for software products and services are generally implemented over
periods of three months to one year with annually renewing service and software
update agreements thereafter although these agreements can be terminated by
either us or the customer historically almost all support and maintenance
agreements are automatically renewed annually contracts for appraisal
outsourcing services are generally one to three years in duration during 2002
approximately 30 of the companys revenue was attributable to ongoing support
and maintenance agreements

competition

we compete with numerous local regional and national firms that provide or
offer some or many of the products and services provided by us most of these
competitors are smaller companies that may be able to offer less expensive
solutions than ours we also compete with national firms some of which have
greater financial and technical resources than us including peoplesoft inc
j d edwards  company lawson software inc maximus inc affiliated
computer services inc tier technologies inc

                                       8
page
sungard data systems inc and manatron inc we also occasionally compete with
central internal information service departments of county or local governments
which require us to persuade the enduser department to discontinue service by
its own personnel and outsource the service to us we compete on a variety of
factors including price service name recognition reputation technological
capabilities and the ability to modify existing products and services to
accommodate the individual requirements of the customer our ability to offer an
integrated system of applications for several offices or departments is often a
competitive strength county and local governmental units often are required to
seek competitive proposals

suppliers

all computers peripherals printers scanners operating system software
office automation software and other equipment necessary for the implementation
and provision of our software systems and services are presently available from
several thirdparty sources hardware is purchased on original equipment
manufacturer or distributor terms at discounts from retail we have not
experienced any significant supply problems

backlog

at december 31 2002 we estimated our sales backlog was approximately 891
million compared to 963 million at december 31 2001 the backlog represents
contracts that have been signed but not delivered or performed as of yearend
approximately 790 million of the backlog is expected to be installed or
services are expected to be performed during 2003

intellectual property proprietary rights and licenses

we regard certain features of our internal operations software and
documentation as confidential and proprietary and rely on a combination of
contractual restrictions trade secret laws and other measures to protect our
proprietary intellectual property we generally do not rely on patents we
believe that due to the rapid rate of technological change in the computer
software industry trade secrets and copyright protection are less significant
than factors such as knowledge ability and experience of our employees
frequent product enhancements and timeliness and quality of support services
we typically license our software products under exclusive license agreements
which are generally nontransferable and have a perpetual term

employees

at december 31 2002 we had approximately 1230 employees appraisal
outsourcing projects are periodic in nature and can be widely dispersed
geographically we often hire temporary employees to assist in these projects
whose term of employment generally ends with the projects completion none of
our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to collective
bargaining agreements we consider our relations with our employees to be
positive

item 3   legal proceedings

on october 29 2001 hte inc hte notified us that pursuant to the
florida control share statute it had redeemed all 56 million shares of hte
common stock owned by us for a cash price of 130 per share the 56 million
shares represent a current ownership interest of approximately 35 of hte a
company whose common stock is traded on the nasdaq national market system on
october 29 2001 we notified hte that its purported redemption of our hte
shares was invalid and contrary to florida

                                       9
page
law and in any event the calculation by hte of fair value for such shares was
incorrect on october 30 2001 hte filed a complaint in a civil court in
seminole county florida requesting the court to enter a declaratory judgment
declaring htes purported redemption of all of our hte shares at a redemption
price of 130 per share was lawful and to effect the redemption and cancel our
hte shares we removed the case to the united states district court middle
district of florida orlando division and requested a declaratory judgment from
the court declaring among other things that htes purported redemption of any
or all of our shares was illegal under florida law and that we had the ability
to vote up to 20 of the issued and outstanding shares of hte common stock owned
by us

on september 18 2002 the court issued an order declaring that htes purported
redemption was invalid accordingly we continue to own 56 million shares of
hte common stock on september 24 2002 we entered into a settlement agreement
with hte in which hte agreed that it would not attempt any other redemption of
our shares in addition hte agreed to dismiss and release us from the tort
claims it alleged against us as disclosed in previous filings on december 11
2002 the court issued a further order declaring that all of our hte shares are
control shares and therefore none of our shares have voting rights the court
further ruled that voting rights would be restored to our hte shares if we were
to sell or otherwise transfer our hte shares to an unaffiliated third party in a
transaction that did not constitute a control share acquisition

one of our nonoperating subsidiaries swan transportation company swan has
been and is currently involved in various claims raised by hundreds of former
employees of a foundry that was once owned by an affiliate of swan and tyler
these claims are for alleged work related injuries and physical conditions
resulting from alleged exposure to silica asbestos andor related industrial
dusts during the plaintiffs employment at the foundry we sold the operating
assets of the foundry on december 1 1995 as a nonoperating subsidiary of
tyler the assets of swan consist primarily of various insurance policies issued
to swan during the relevant time periods and restricted cash of 13 million at
december 31 2002 swan tendered the defense and indemnity obligations arising
from these claims to its insurance carriers who prior to december 20 2001
entered into settlement agreements with approximately 275 of the plaintiffs
each of whom agreed to release swan tyler and its subsidiaries and affiliates
from all such claims in exchange for payments made by the insurance carriers

on december 20 2001 swan filed a petition under chapter 11 of the us
bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of
delaware the bankruptcy filing by swan was the result of extensive negotiations
between tyler swan their respective insurance carriers and an ad hoc
committee of plaintiff attorneys representing substantially all of the then
known plaintiffs swan filed its plan of reorganization in february 2002 the
principal features of the plan of reorganization include a the creation of a
trust which is to be funded principally by fifteen insurance carriers pursuant
to certain settlement agreements executed prepetition between swan tyler and
such carriers b the implementation of a claims resolution procedure pursuant
to which all present and future claimants may assert claims against such trust
for alleged injuries c the issuance of certain injunctions under the federal
bankruptcy laws requiring any such claims to be asserted against the trust and
barring such claims from being asserted either now or in the future against
swan tyler all of tylers affected affiliates and the insurers participating
in the funding of the trust and d the full and final release of each of swan
tyler all of tylers affected affiliates and the insurers participating in the
funding of the trust from any and all claims associated with the onceowned
foundry by all claimants that assert a claim against and receive compensation
from the trust

the confirmation hearings on swans plan of reorganization were held on december
9 2002 the plan of reorganization received the affirmative vote of
approximately 99 of the total votes cast all objections to the plan were
resolved prior to the confirmation hearing and the final confirmation order
will therefore not be subject to appeal the confirmation order discharges
releases and extinguishes all of the foundryrelated obligations and
liabilities of tyler swan their affected affiliates and the insurers
participating in the funding of the trust further the confirmation order
includes the issuance of injunctions that channel all present and future
foundryrelated claims into the trust and forever bar any such claims from being
asserted either now or in the future against swan tyler their affected
affiliates and the participating insurers in order to receive the benefits
described above we have agreed among other things to transfer all of the
capital stock of swan to the trust so that the trust can directly pursue claims
against insurers who have not participated in the funding of the trust in
addition we have agreed to contribute 15 million in cash to the trust which
is due as follows 750000 within ten days of the confirmation order becoming a
final order 500000 on the first anniversary of the date the confirmation
order becomes a final order and 250000 on the second anniversary of the date
the confirmation order becomes a final order the confirmation order will become
a final order thirty days after execution by both the bankruptcy and district
court judges which is expected to occur by the end of the first quarter of

critical accounting policies and estimates

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is
based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states
gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities the notes to the consolidated financial
statements contained herein describe our significant accounting policies used in
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements on an on going basis
we evaluate our estimates including but not limited to those related to
intangible assets bad debts and our longterm service contracts we base our
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we
believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect significant
judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial
statements

revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of
the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position
sop 972 software revenue recognition as amended by sop 984 and sop
989 as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the
american institute of certified public accountants and in accordance with the
sec staff accounting bulletin no 101 revenue recognition in financial
statements our revenues are derived from software licenses hardware
postcontract customer supportmaintenance and services that typically range from
installation training and basic consulting to software modification and
customization to meet specific customer needs for multiple element software
arrangements which do not entail the performance of services that are
considered essential to the functionality of the software we generally record
revenue when the delivered products or performed services result in a legally
enforceable claim we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts sales
adjustments and estimated cost of product warranties which are provided at the
time the revenue is recognized since most of our customers are governmental
entities we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to
make required

                                       14
page
payments occasionally customers may become dissatisfied with the functionality
of the software products andor the quality of the services and request a
reduction of the total contract price or similar concession while we engage in
extensive product and service quality assurance programs and processes our
allowances for these contract price reductions may need to be revised in the
future in connection with our customer contracts and the adequacy of related
allowances and measures of progress towards contract completion our project
managers are charged with the responsibility to continually review the status of
each customer on a specific contract basis also management at our corporate
offices as well as at our operating companies review on at least a quarterly
basis significant past due accounts receivable and the adequacy of related
reserves events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying
amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts sales adjustments and estimated
cost of product warranties may require revision include but are not limited
to deterioration of a customers financial condition failure to manage our
customers expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered and
defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products

for those minimal number of software arrangements that include customization of
the software which is considered essential to its functionality and for
substantially all of our real estate appraisal outsourcing projects we
recognize revenue and profit as the work progresses using the
percentageofcompletion method this method relies on estimates of total
expected contract revenue billings and collections and expected contract costs
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs
applicable to various stages of a contract can be made at times we perform
additional andor noncontractual services for little to no incremental fee to
satisfy customer expectations if changes occur in delivery productivity or
other factors used in developing our estimates of expected costs or revenues we
revise our cost and revenue estimates and any revisions are charged to income
in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision first become
known

intangible assets and goodwill our business acquisitions typically result in
the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances and these balances
affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense as well as
expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge the cost of
acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets
based on estimated fair value with the excess allocated to goodwill
accordingly we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible
assets including software customer base and goodwill in addition we
capitalize software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment
of technological feasibility on a specific software project certain of these
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives all
intangible assets with definite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment
annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of goodwill
is generally measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its
fair value generally determined by estimated future net cash flows expected to
be generated by the asset recoverability of other intangible assets is
generally measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated
undiscounted future cash flows the assessment of recoverability or of the
estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing
or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved events
or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be
recoverable include but are not limited to a significant decrease in the
market value of the business or asset acquired a significant adverse change in
the extent or manner in which the business or asset acquired is used or a
significant adverse change in the business climate in addition products
capabilities or technologies developed by others may render our software
products obsolete or noncompetitive

software license revenues software license revenues increased 48 million or
25 for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 2001 during 2002 we
recognized approximately 24 million in license revenues from four customers
for real estate appraisal software while we recorded minimal license revenues
from appraisal software in 2001 the remainder of the increase in software
license revenues was related to expansion of our financial and city solutions
software products into the midwest and the western united states and was aided
by the release of several new financial and city solutions products and
enhancements our financial and city solutions software products automate
accounting systems for cities counties school districts public utilities and
notforprofit organizations

software services revenues for the year ended december 31 2002 software
services revenues increased 42 million or 19 compared to 2001 the increase
in software services is primarily related to higher software license sales
typically contracts for software licenses include services such as installation
of the software conversion of customer data to be compatible with the new
software and training customer personnel to use the software in addition
software services revenues for 2002 included approximately 19 million for
services performed under an 110 million contract signed with the state of
minnesota in july 2002 to install our new odyssey court case management system
the minnesota contract includes both software license and software services but
no license revenues were recognized under the contract in 2002 approximately
70 of the installation is expected to be performed by late 2003 the remainder
of the installation is expected to be performed from 2004 through 2006

maintenance revenues for the year ended december 31 2002 maintenance revenue
increased 41 million or 11 from 366 million for 2001 we provide
maintenance and support services for our software products third party software
and hardware the maintenance revenue increase was due to growth in our
installed customer base and slightly higher rates during 2001 we received and
recorded as revenue a onetime settlement of approximately 650000 from a third
party provider of maintenance services relating to past services excluding this
settlement maintenance revenue increased approximately 13 for the year ended
december 31 2002 compared to the prior year

appraisal services revenues appraisal services revenues increased 26 million
or 7 for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 2001 the increase was
primarily related to our contract with lake county indiana which was first
awarded in december 2001 the contract to provide professional services and
technology to reassess real property in lake county is valued at 159 million
of which 144 million relates to appraisal services and is expected to be
completed by late 2003 during 2002 appraisal services revenue also included
121 million of appraisal revenue related to our contract with the nassau
county new york board of assessors nassau county which was comparable to
the amount recognized in 2001 substantially all of the work related to nassau
county contract had been completed as of december 31 2002

cost of revenues

cost of software license revenues for the year ended december 31 2002 cost of
software license revenues increased 14 million or 33 compared to the prior
year primarily due to higher amortization expense of software development
costs in 2001 we had several products in the development stage which were
released beginning in the third quarter of 2001 once a product is available for
general release we begin to expense the costs associated with the development
generally over the estimated useful life of the product

                                       17
page
development costs mainly consist of personnel costs such as salary and benefits
paid to our software developers rent for related office space and capitalized
interest costs

cost of software service and maintenance revenues for the year ended december
31 2002 cost of software services and maintenance revenues increased 42
million or 9 compared to 2001 this increase is consistent with the higher
software services and maintenance revenues for the same period although
software services and maintenance revenues grew at a higher rate than the cost
of those revenues which is reflective of more efficient utilization of our
support and maintenance staff and economies of scale as a percentage of related
revenues cost of software services and maintenance was 76 in 2002 compared to
79 in 2001

cost of appraisal services revenues for the year ended december 31 2002 cost
of appraisal service revenue increased approximately 16 million or 7
compared to the year ended december 31 2001 this increase is consistent with
the increase in appraisal services revenue which also rose 7 compared to the
prior year cost of appraisal services revenues as a percentage of appraisal
services revenue was 68 for 2002 compared to 69 for 2001

gross profit

for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 our overall gross margin was 36
and 34 respectively the 2002 gross margin benefited from a product mix that
included more software license revenues and higher maintenance revenues than the
prior year software license revenues have lower associated costs than other
revenues such as software and appraisal services third party software and
hardware in addition utilization of our personnel that provide services and
support has improved which has increased our overall gross profit the increase
in our gross profit was offset slightly by higher software development
amortization during 2002

selling general and administrative expenses

selling general and administrative expenses or sga increased 31 million
or 10 for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to the prior year as a
percentage of revenues sga was 25 in 2002 compared to 26 in 2001 the 31
million increase in sga was related primarily to higher costs with respect to
sales commissions and increases in health and other insurance expenses

amortization of acquisition intangibles

our amortization of acquisition intangibles for the year ended december 31 2001
amounted to 69 million including 36 million for amortization of goodwill
and workforce costs effective january 1 2002 we adopted statement of
financial accounting standards sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible
assets as a result of adopting sfas no 142 we ceased amortizing goodwill and
workforce after december 31 2001 the remaining amortization consisted of those
costs allocated to our customer base and acquisition date software see further
discussion of the effect of adopting sfas no 142 in note 7 in notes to the
consolidated financial statements

interest income expense

our cash balances have increased significantly during 2002 due to cash generated
from operations the receipt of proceeds from the sale of certain discontinued
businesses and the exercise of stock options in 2002 we invested excess cash in
money market investments offsetting interest income from these money market
investments was 255000 of interest expense for an outstanding 25 million
note payable as a result we had net interest income of 6000 for the year
ended december 31 2002 compared to net interest expense of 479000 for 2001
in addition during the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 we capitalized
269000 and 578000 respectively of interest costs related to capitalized
software development costs

income tax provision

we had an effective income tax rate of 39 for the year ended december 31 2002
for the year ended december 31 2001 we had an effective income tax rate of
85 our effective income tax rate in both years exceeded the federal statutory
rate of 35 due primarily to the net effect of state income taxes and items that
are nondeductible for federal income tax purposes including certain non
taxdeductible goodwill amortization in periods prior to 2002

discontinued operations

discontinued operations consists of the operating results of the information and
property records services segment which we discontinued in december 2000 two
nonoperating subsidiaries relating to a formerly owned subsidiary that we sold
in december 1995 and an automotive parts distributor that we sold in march 1999

on september 29 2000 we sold certain net assets of kofile inc and another
subsidiary our interest in a certain intangible work product and a building
and related building improvements the kofile sale for a cash sale price of
144 million effective december 29 2000 we sold for cash our land records
business unit consisting of business resources corporation resources to an
affiliate of affiliated computer services inc acs the resources sale
the resources sale was valued at approximately 710 million concurrent with
the resources sale our management with our board of directors approval
adopted a formal plan of disposal for the remaining businesses and assets of the
information and property records services segment this restructuring program
was designed to focus our resources on our software systems and services segment
and to reduce debt the businesses and assets divested or identified for
divesture were classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements in 2000 and the prior periods financial
statements were restated to report separately their operations in compliance
with apb opinion no 30 the net gain on the kofile sale and the resources sale
amounted to approximately 15 million net of an income tax benefit of 24
million

our formal plan of disposal provided for the remaining businesses and assets of
the information and property records services segment to be disposed of by
december 29 2001 the estimated loss on the disposal of these remaining
businesses and assets at december 29 2000 amounted to 136 million after an
income tax benefit of 38 million this loss consisted of an estimated loss on
disposal of the businesses of 115 million net of an income tax benefit of
27 million and a provision of 21 million after an income tax benefit of
11 million for anticipated operating losses from the measurement date of
december 29 2000 to the estimated disposal dates

on may 16 2001 we sold all of the common stock of one of the remaining
businesses in the discontinued information and property records services
segment in connection with the sale we received cash proceeds of 575000
approximately 60000 shares of tyler common stock a promissory note of 750000
payable in 58 monthly installments at an interest rate of 9 and other
contingent consideration on september 21 2001 we sold all of the common stock
of capital commerce reporter inc for 31 million in cash

we renegotiated certain aspects of the may 16 2001 sale transaction and as a
result of this renegotiation in march 2002 we received additional cash of
approximately 800000 and a subordinated note receivable for 200000 to fully
settle the promissory note and other contingent consideration received in
connection with this sale the subordinated note is payable in 16 equal
quarterly principal payments with interest at a rate of 6 because the
subordinated note receivable is highly dependent upon future operations of the
buyer we are recording its value when the cash is received which is our
historical practice during 2002 we received receipts of 46000 on the
subordinated note

during the year ended december 31 2002 the irs issued temporary regulations
which in effect allowed us to deduct for tax purposes losses attributable to the
march 1999 sale of our automotive parts subsidiary that were previously not
allowed the tax benefit of allowing the deduction of this loss amounted to
approximately 970000 in addition we renegotiated a note receivable and
certain contingent consideration in connection with a subsidiary sold in 2001
and received proceeds of approximately 846000 in 2002 we initially assigned
no value for accounting purposes to the note receivable and contingent
consideration when the loss on the disposal of the discontinued operations was
first established in 2000 and when the note was first received in 2001 in
addition we settled in the fourth quarter of 2002 our asbestos litigation for
an amount that was approximately 200000 less than the liability initially
established for this matter see note 16 in notes to consolidated financial
statements the aggregate effects of these events net of the related tax
effects and other minor adjustments to the reserve for discontinued operations
resulted in a credit to discontinued operations of 18 million in 2002 in our
opinion and based on information available at this time we believe the net
liabilities related to discontinued operations are adequate

the income tax expense or benefit associated with the gains or losses on the
respective sales of the businesses in the information and property records
services segment differs from the statutory income tax rate of 35 due to the
elimination of deferred taxes related to the basis difference between amounts
reported for income taxes and financial reporting purposes and the utilization
of available capital loss carryforwards which were fully reserved in the
valuation account prior to the respective sales

one of our nonoperating subsidiaries is involved in various claims for
workrelated injuries and physical conditions relating to a formerlyowned
subsidiary that we sold in 1995 for the years ended december 31 2001 and 2000

3000 and 748000 respectively for trial and related costs see note 16 in

investment security availableforsale

pursuant to an agreement with two major shareholders of hte inc hte we
acquired approximately 56 million shares of htes common stock in exchange for
approximately 28 million shares of our common stock the exchange occurred in
two transactions one in august 1999 and the other in december 1999 the 56
million shares represent a current ownership interest of approximately 35 of
hte the cost of the investment was recorded at 158 million and is classified
as a noncurrent asset

florida state corporation law restricts the voting rights of control shares
as defined acquired by a third party in certain types of acquisitions these
restrictions may be removed by a vote of the shareholders of hte on november
16 2000 the shareholders of hte other than tyler voted to deny tyler its
right to vote the control shares of hte when we acquired the hte shares hte
took the position that all of our shares were control shares and therefore did
not have voting rights we disputed this contention and asserted that the
control shares were only those shares in excess of 20 of the outstanding
shares of hte and it was only those shares that lacked voting rights at the
time of our acquisition no court had interpreted the florida control share
statute

on october 29 2001 hte notified us that pursuant to the florida control
share statute it had redeemed all 56 million shares of hte common stock owned
by us for a cash price of 130 per share on october 29 2001 we notified hte
that its purported redemption of our hte shares was invalid and contrary to
florida law and in any event the calculation by hte of fair value for our
shares was incorrect on october 30 2001 hte filed a complaint in a civil
court in seminole county florida requesting the court to enter a declaratory
judgment declaring htes purported redemption of all of our hte shares at a
redemption price of 130 per share was lawful and to effect the redemption and
cancel our hte shares we removed the case to the united states district court
middle district of florida orlando division and requested a declaratory
judgment from the court declaring among other things that htes purported
redemption of any or all of our shares was illegal under florida law and that we
had the ability to vote up to 20 of the issued and outstanding shares of hte
common stock owned by us

on september 18 2002 the court issued an order declaring that htes purported
redemption was invalid on september 24 2002 we entered into a settlement
agreement with hte in which hte agreed that it would not attempt any other
redemption of our shares in addition hte agreed to dismiss and release us from
the tort claims it alleged against us as disclosed in previous filings on
december 11 2002 the court issued a further order declaring that all of our
hte shares are control shares and therefore none of our shares have voting
rights the court further ruled that voting rights would be restored to our hte
shares if we were to sell or otherwise transfer our hte shares to an
unaffiliated third party in a transaction that did not constitute a control
share acquisition during 2002 approximately 704000 of legal and other
related costs associated with these matters were charged to nonoperating
expenses

under gaap a 20 investment in the voting stock of another company creates the
presumption that the investor has significant influence over the operating and
financial policies of that company unless there is evidence to the contrary
our management has concluded that we do not have such influence accordingly we
account for our investment in hte pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 115
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities these
securities are classified as availableforsale and are recorded at fair value
as determined by quoted market prices for hte common stock

on february 4 2003 we entered into an agreement with sungard data systems
inc sds in which we agreed to tender all of our hte shares in a tender
offer to be commenced by sds for the acquisition of hte on february 5 2003
sds and hte announced a definitive agreement for the acquisition of all of the
shares of hte for 700 per share in cash sds and hte also announced that the
consummation of the transaction is subject to customary conditions including
the tender of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of hte in the tender
offer and the expiration of the waiting period under the hartscottrodino
antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended sds and hte further announced
that certain shareholders owning approximately 496 of the total outstanding
shares of hte had agreed to tender their shares according to the press release
issued by sds and hte the acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter
of 2003 assuming the acquisition is consummated we will receive approximately
393 million in gross cash proceeds from the sale of our hte shares there can
be no assurance that the acquisition of hte by sds will be consummated on the
terms as disclosed if at all if sds does not acquire hte we will continue to
classify our investment as an availableforsale security in accordance with
sfas no 115 and as a noncurrent asset since the investment was initially made
for a continuing business purpose

2001 compared to 2000

revenues

revenues were 1188 million for the year ended december 31 2001 a 26
increase from revenues of 939 million for the prior year

software license revenues software license revenues increased each quarter
during 2001 from 40 million in the first quarter to 58 million in the fourth
quarter for the year ended december 31 2001 software license revenue was
195 million compared to 193 million for the year ended december 31 2000
the increase was due mainly to sales of thirdparty software that provided
additional functionality to certain modules of our proprietary software sales
of proprietary software to new customers and in new geographic areas primarily
the midwestern united states and sales of upgraded financial and utility
software modules to existing customers the increase was somewhat offset by
lower tax and appraisal software sales

software services revenues software services revenues grew 11 to 215 million
for the year ended december 31 2001 from 194 million for the year ended
december 31 2000 the increase was due to higher proprietary software sales as
we offer services such as installation of the software conversion of the
customers data to be compatible with the software and training of the customer
personnel to use the software in addition during 2001 we entered into more
serviceintensive contracts particularly related to our tax products

maintenance revenues for the year ended december 31 2001 maintenance revenue
increased 26 to 366 million from 291 million for 2000 higher maintenance
revenues were due to an increase in our base of installed software and systems
products and maintenance rate increases for several product lines maintenance
and support services are provided for our software and related products

appraisal services revenues for the year ended december 31 2001 appraisal
services revenues were 347 million compared to 209 million in the prior
year the 66 increase for the year in appraisal services revenues was primarily
due to our continued progress on our contract with nassau county the contract
to provide outsourced assessment services for nassau county together with tax
assessment administration software and training is valued at approximately
340 million implementation of the nassau county contract began in september
2000 for the year ended december 31 2001 we recorded 144 million of
professional services revenue related to nassau county

hardware and other revenues hardware and other revenues increased 13 million
for the year ended december 31 2001 from 52 million for the same period of
2000 approximately 700000 of the increase related to the nassau county
contract other increases were due to timing of installations of equipment on
customer contracts and are dependent on the contract size and on varying
customer hardware needs

cost of revenues

for the year ended december 31 2001 cost of revenues was 788 million
compared to 597 million for the year ended december 31 2000 the increase in
cost of revenues was primarily due to the increase in revenues

gross margin was 34 for the year ended december 31 2001 compared to 36 for
the year ended december 31 2000 overall gross margin was lower because our
2001 revenue mix included more appraisal services compared to 2000
historically gross profit is higher for software licenses than for software and
appraisal services due to personnel costs associated with services in addition
software license costs increased during 2001 compared to 2000 due to increased
amortization of software development costs we released several new products
during the second and third quarters of 2001 at which time we began to amortize
the related software development costs

selling general and administrative expenses

selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31
2001 was 308 million compared to 328 million in the prior year selling
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues declined to 26
in 2001 from 35 in 2000 because such expenses are primarily fixed and therefore
did not increase in proportion to our revenue growth the decline in selling
general and administrative expenses was due to a reduction in corporate costs
following the sale of the information and property records services segment
lower acquisitionrelated costs such as legal and travel expenses and lower
research and development costs which are expensed

amortization of acquisition intangibles

we accounted for all of our past acquisitions using the purchase method of
accounting for business combinations prior to the adoption of sfas no 142 the
excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets
of the acquired companies goodwill was amortized using the straightline
method of amortization over their respective estimated useful lives
amortization expense of acquisition intangibles was 69 million in 2001 and
2000

net interest expense

net interest expense was 479000 for the year ended december 31 2001 compared
to 49 million for the year ended december 31 2000 interest expense declined
due to a significant reduction in bank debt with the proceeds from the disposal
of our former information and property records services segment in addition
during 2001 we capitalized 578000 of interest costs related to internally
developed software products compared to 586000 for 2000

income tax provision

for the year ended december 31 2001 we had income from continuing operations
before income taxes of 18 million and an income tax provision of 15 million
resulting in an effective tax rate of 85 the high effective income tax rate is
primarily attributable to non taxdeductible goodwill amortization for 2000 we
incurred a loss from continuing operations before income tax benefit of 103
million and an income tax benefit of 28 million resulting in an effective
benefit rate of 27

net income

net income was 269000 in 2001 compared to a net loss of 246 million in 2000
for 2001 diluted earnings per share was 001 and for 2000 diluted loss per
share was 054 income from continuing operations was 272000 or 001 per
diluted share in 2001 compared to a loss from continuing operations of 75
million or 017 per diluted share in 2000

borrowings under the credit agreement and had an available borrowing base of
63 million

price of 14 million

on february 4 2003 we entered into an agreement with sungard data systems inc
sds in which we agreed to tender all of our hte shares in the tender offer
to be commenced by sds for the acquisition of hte on february 5 2003 sds and
hte announced a definitive agreement for the acquisition of all of the shares of
hte for 700 per share in cash assuming the acquisition is consummated we
will receive approximately 393 million in gross cash proceeds from the sale of

nonoperating subsidiaries we have agreed to contribute approximately 15
million over the next three years to a trust that was set up as part of the
reorganization see note 16 in the notes to the consolidated financial
statements

from time to time we have discussions relating to acquisitions and we expect to
continue to assess these and other strategic acquisition opportunities as they
arise we may also require additional financing if we decide to make additional
acquisitions there can be no assurance however that any such opportunities
will arise that any such acquisitions will be consummated or that any needed
additional financing will be available when required on terms satisfactory to
us absent any acquisitions we anticipate that existing cash balances cash
flows from operations working capital and available borrowing capacity under
our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient funds to meet our needs
for at least the next year

capitalization

at december 31 2002 our capitalization consisted of 30 million of longterm
obligations including the current portion of those obligations and 1187
million of shareholders equity our total debttocapital ratio total debt
divided by the sum of total shareholders equity and total longterm
obligations was 2 at december 31 2002

factors that may affect future results and market price of our stock

an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk investors
evaluating our company should carefully consider the factors described below and
all other information contained in this annual report any of the following
factors could materially harm our business operating results and financial
condition additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or
that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business operating
results and financial condition this section should be read in conjunction
with the consolidated financial statements and related notes and managements
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
included in this annual report we may make forwardlooking statements from time
to time both written and oral we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly
release the results of any revisions to these forwardlooking statements our
actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such
forwardlooking statements due to a number of factors including those set forth
below and elsewhere in this annual report

                                       24

a decline in information technology spending may result in a decrease in our
revenues or lower our growth rate

a decline in the demand for information technology among our current and
prospective customers may result in decreased revenues or a lower growth rate
for us because our sales depend in part on our customers level of funding for
new or additional information technology systems and services moreover demand
for our solutions may be reduced by a decline in overall demand for computer
software and services the current technology recession and decline in overall
technology spending terrorist activity and threats of hostilities in the
middle east and asia may cause our customers to reduce or eliminate information
technology spending and cause price erosion for our solutions which would
substantially reduce the number of new software licenses we sell and the average
sales price for these licenses because of these market and economic conditions
we believe there will continue to be uncertainty in the level of demand for our
products and services accordingly we cannot assure you that we will be able to
increase or maintain our revenues

we may experience fluctuations in quarterly revenue that could adversely impact
our stock price and our operating results

our actual revenues in a quarter could fall below expectations which could lead
to a decline in our stock price our revenues and operating results are
difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter
revenues from license fees in any quarter depend substantially upon our
contracting activity and our ability to recognize revenues in that quarter in
accordance with our revenue recognition policies our quarterly revenue may
fluctuate and may be difficult to forecast for a variety of reasons including
the following

                 a significant number of our prospective customers decisions
                  regarding whether to enter into license agreements with us are
                  made within the last few weeks of each quarter

                 we have historically had a higher concentration of revenues in
                  the second half of our fiscal year due to governmental budget
                  and spending tendencies

                 the size of license transactions can vary significantly

                 customers may unexpectedly postpone or cancel orders due to
                  changes in their strategic priorities project objectives
                  budget or personnel

                 customer purchasing processes vary significantly and a
                  customers internal approval and expenditure authorization
                  process can be difficult and time consuming to complete even
                  after selection of a vendor

                 the number timing and significance of software product
                  enhancements and new software product announcements by us and
                  our competitors may affect purchase decisions and

                 we may have to defer revenues under our revenue recognition
                  policies

fluctuation in our quarterly revenues may adversely affect our operating
results in each fiscal quarter our expense levels operating costs and hiring
plans are based on projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed if
our actual revenues fall below expectations we could experience a reduction in
operating results

as with other software vendors we may be required to delay revenue recognition
into future periods which could adversely impact our operating results

we have in the past had to and in the future may have to defer revenue
recognition for license fees due to several factors including whether

                 license agreements include applications that are under
                  development or other undelivered elements

                 we must deliver services including significant modifications
                  customization or complex interfaces which could delay
                  product delivery or acceptance

                 the transaction involves acceptance criteria

                 the transaction involves contingent payment terms or fees

                 we are required to accept a fixedfee services contract or

                 we are required to accept extended payment terms

because of the factors listed above and other specific requirements under
generally accepted accounting principles in the united states for software
revenue recognition we must have very precise terms in our license agreements
in order to recognize revenue when we initially deliver and install software or
perform services negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions can
extend the sales

                                       25
page
cycle and sometimes we do not obtain terms and conditions that permit revenue
recognition at the time of delivery or even as work on the project is completed

increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues could decrease
overall margins and adversely affect our operating results

we realize lower margins on software and appraisal service revenues than on
license revenue the majority of our contracts involve both the license of
software and the provision of professional services therefore an increase in
the percentage of software service and appraisal service revenue compared to
license revenue could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and
could adversely affect operating results

selling products and services into the public sector poses unique challenges

we derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of software and services
to state county and city governments other municipal agencies and other
public entities we expect that sales to public sector customers will continue
to account for substantially all of our revenues in the future we face many
risks and challenges associated with contracting with governmental entities
including

                 the sales cycle of governmental agencies may be complex and
                  lengthy

                 payments under some public sector contracts are subject to
                  achieving implementation milestones and we have had and may
                  in the future have differences with customers as to whether
                  milestones have been achieved

                 political resistance to the concept of government agencies
                  contracting with third parties to provide information
                  technology solutions

                 changes in legislation authorizing governments contracting
                  with third parties

                 the internal review process by governmental agencies for bid
                  acceptance

                 changes to the bidding procedures by governmental agencies

                 changes in governmental administrations and personnel

                 limitations on governmental resources placed by budgetary
                  restraints which in some circumstances may provide for a
                  termination of executed contracts because of a lack of future
                  funding and

                 the general effect of economic downturns and other changes on
                  local governments ability to spend public funds on
                  outsourcing arrangements

each of these risks is outside our control if we fail to adequately adapt to
these risks and uncertainties our financial performance could be adversely
affected

the open bidding process for governmental contracts creates uncertainty in
predicting future contract awards

many governmental agencies purchase products and services through an open
bidding process generally a governmental entity will publish an established
list of requirements requesting potential vendors to propose solutions for the
established requirements to respond successfully to these requests for
proposals we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a
proposed contract the time required to establish operations for the proposed
client and the likely terms of any other third party proposals submitted we
cannot guarantee that we will win any bids in the future through the request for
proposal process or that any winning bids will ultimately result in contracts
on favorable terms our failure to secure contracts through the open bidding
process or to secure such contracts on favorable terms may adversely affect
our business financial condition and results of operations

fixed price contracts may affect our profits

some of our present contracts are on a fixedpriced basis which can lead to
various risks including

                 the failure to accurately estimate the resources and time
                  required for an engagement

                 the failure to effectively manage governmental agencies and
                  other customers expectations regarding the scope of services
                  to be delivered for an estimated price and

                 the failure to timely complete fixedprice engagements within
                  budget to the customers satisfaction

if we do not adequately assess these and other risks we may be subject to cost
overruns and penalties which may harm our business financial condition or
results of operations

we face significant competition from other vendors and potential new entrants
into our markets

we believe we are a leading provider of integrated solutions for the public
sector however we face competition from a variety of software vendors that
offer products and services similar to those offered by us as well as from
companies offering to develop custom software we compete on the basis of a
number of factors including

                 the attractiveness of the business strategy and services we
                  offer

                 the breadth of products and services we offer

                 price

                 quality of products and service

                 technological innovation

                 name recognition and

                 our ability to modify existing products and services to
                  accommodate the particular needs of our customers

we believe the market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors
that vary in size primary computer platforms and overall product scope our
competitors include the consulting divisions of national and regional accounting
firms publicly held companies that focus on selected segments of the public
sector market and a significant number of smaller privately held companies
certain competitors have greater technical marketing and financial resources
than us we cannot assure you that such competitors will not develop products or
offer services that are superior to our products or services or that achieve
greater market acceptance

we also compete with internal centralized information service departments of
governmental entities which require us to persuade the enduser to stop the
internal service and outsource to us in addition our customers may elect in
the future to provide information management services internally through new or
existing departments which will reduce the market for our services

we could face additional competition as other established and emerging companies
enter the public sector software application market and new products and
technologies are introduced increased competition could result in price
reductions fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market
share in addition current and potential competitors may make strategic
acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with
thirdparties thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the
needs of our prospective customers it is possible that new competitors or
alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain
significant market share further competitive pressures could require us to
reduce the price of our software licenses and related services we cannot assure
you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future
competitors and the failure to do so would have material adverse effect upon
our business operating results and financial condition

we must respond to rapid technological changes to be competitive

the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change
evolving industry standards in computer hardware and software technology
changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and
enhancements the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the
emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and
unmarketable as a result our future success will depend in part upon our
ability to continue to enhance existing products and develop and introduce in a
timely manner or acquire new products that keep pace with technological
developments satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and
achieve market acceptance we cannot assure you that we will successfully
identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market
in a timely and costeffective manner further we cannot assure you that the
products capabilities or technologies developed by others will not render our
products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive if we are unable to develop
or acquire on a timely and costeffective basis new software products or
enhancements to existing products or if such new products or enhancements do
not achieve market acceptance our business operating results and financial
condition may be materially adversely affected

our failure to properly manage growth could adversely affect our business

we have expanded our operations rapidly since february 1998 when we entered the
business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector we
intend to continue expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and
potential market opportunities this rapid growth places a significant demand on
management and operational resources in order to manage growth effectively we
must implement and improve our operational systems procedures and controls on
a timely basis we must also identify hire train and manage key managerial
and technical personnel if we fail to implement these systems or employ and
retain such qualified personnel our business financial condition and results
of operations may be materially and adversely affected

                                       27

in addition a significant portion of our growth has resulted from strategic
acquisitions in new product and geographic markets although our future focus
will be on internal growth we will continue to identify and pursue strategic
acquisitions and alliances with suitable candidates our future success will
depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate past and future
acquisitions and other strategic alliances into our operations acquisitions may
involve a number of special risks including diversion of managements
attention failure to retain key acquired personnel unanticipated events or
circumstances legal liabilities and amortization of certain acquired
intangible assets some or all of these risks could have a material adverse
effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although
we conduct due diligence reviews of potential acquisition candidates we may not
identify all material liabilities or risks related to acquisition candidates
there can be no assurance that any such strategic acquisitions or alliances will
be accomplished on favorable terms or will result in profitable operations

we may be unable to hire integrate and retain qualified personnel

our continued success will depend upon the availability and performance of our
key management sales marketing customer support and product development
personnel the loss of key management or technical personnel could adversely
affect us we believe that our continued success will depend in large part upon
our ability to attract integrate and retain such personnel we have at times
experienced and continue to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified
personnel competition for qualified software development sales and other
personnel is intense and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in
attracting and retaining such personnel

we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights

many of our product and service offerings incorporate proprietary information
trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property rights we rely on a
combination of contracts copyrights and trade secret laws to establish and
protect our proprietary rights in our technology we cannot be certain that we
have taken all appropriate steps to deter misappropriation of our intellectual
property in addition there has been significant litigation in the united
states in recent years involving intellectual property rights we are not
currently involved in any material intellectual property litigation we may
however be a party to intellectual property litigation in the future to protect
our proprietary information trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual
property rights further we cannot assure you that third parties will not
assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us in the future with
respect to current or future products any claims or litigation with or without
merit could be timeconsuming and result in costly litigation and diversion of
managements attention further any claims and litigation could cause product
shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements
such royalty or licensing arrangements if required may not be available on
terms acceptable to us if at all thus litigation to defend and enforce our
intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our
business financial condition and results of operations regardless of the
final outcome of such litigation

our products are complex and as such we run the risk of errors or defects with
new product introductions or enhancements

software products as complex as those developed by us may contain errors or
defects especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements
are released although we have not experienced material adverse effects
resulting from any such defects or errors to date we cannot assure you that
material defects and errors will not be found after commencement of product
shipments any such defects could result in loss of revenues or delay market
acceptance

our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed
to limit our exposure to potential liability claims it is possible however
that the limitation of liability provisions contained in our license agreements
may not be effective as a result of existing or future federal state or local
laws or ordinances or judicial decisions although we maintain errors and
omissions and general liability insurance and we try to structure our contracts
to include limitations on liability we cannot assure you that a successful
claim would not have a material adverse effect on our business financial
condition and results of operations

our application service provider strategy has yet to gain widespread acceptance

some businesses choose to access enterprise software applications through
application service providers or asps which are businesses that host
applications and provide access to software on a subscription basis the public
sector market for asp solutions is new and unproven acceptance of our asp model
depends upon the ability and willingness of different governmental entities to
accept and implement asp solutions our clients have expressed security and
privacy concerns with the asp model including a concern regarding the
confidential nature of the information and transactions available from and
conducted with governments and concerns regarding offsite storage of such
information we have limited experience selling our solutions through asps and
may not be successful in generating revenue from this distribution channel

changes in the insurance markets may affect our ability to win some contract
awards and may lead to increased expenses

some of our customers primarily those for our property appraisal services
require that we secure performance bonds before they will select us as their
vendor the number of qualified highrated insurance companies that offer
performance bonds has decreased in recent years while the costs associated with
securing these bonds has increased dramatically in addition we are generally
required to issue a letter of credit as security for the issuance of a
performance bond each letter of credit we issue reduces our borrowing capacity
under our senior secured credit agreement we cannot guarantee that we will be
able to secure such performance bonds in the future on terms that are favorable
to us if at all our inability to obtain performance bonds on favorable terms
or at all could impact our future ability to win some contract awards
particularly large property appraisal services contracts which could have a
material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of
operations

recent volatility in the stock markets increasing shareholder litigation the
adoption of expansive legislation that redefines corporate controls in
particular legislation adopted to prevent future corporate and accounting
scandals as well as other factors have recently led to significant increases
in premiums for directors and officers liability insurance the number of
insurers offering directors and officers insurance at competitive rates has also
decreased in recent years we cannot predict when the insurance market for such
coverage will stabilize if at all the continued volatility of the insurance
market may result in future increases in our general and administrative
expenses which may adversely affect future operating results

compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public
disclosure may result in additional expenses

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and
public disclosure including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 new securities and
exchange commission regulations and new york stock exchange rules are creating
uncertainty for companies such as ours to maintain high standards of corporate
governance and public disclosure we intend to invest all reasonably necessary
resources to comply with evolving standards this investment may result in
increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time
and attention from revenuegenerating activities

our stock price may be volatile

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and may be significantly
affected by many different factors some examples of factors that can have a
significant impact on our stock price include

                 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results

                 announcements of technological innovations new products or
                  new contracts by us or our competitors

                 developments with respect to patents copyrights or other
                  proprietary rights

                 conditions and trends in the software and other technology
                  industries

                 adoption of new accounting standards affecting the software
                  industry

                 changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and

                 general market conditions and other factors

in addition the stock market has from time to time experienced significant
price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices
for the common stock of technology companies these broad market fluctuations
may adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the past
following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular companys
securities securities class action litigation has often been brought against
that company we cannot assure you that similar litigation will not occur in the
future with respect to us such litigation could result in substantial costs and
a diversion of managements attention and resources which could have a material
adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition

historically we have not paid dividends on our common stock

we have not declared or paid a cash dividend since we entered the business of
providing software solutions and services to the public sector in february 1998
our credit agreement restricts our ability to pay cash dividends we intend to
retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business we do
not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable
future

provisions in our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law could
deter takeover attempts

our board of directors may issue up to 1000000 shares of preferred stock and
may determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions
including voting and conversion rights of these shares of preferred stock
these determinations may be made without any further vote or action by our
stockholders the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to
and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred
stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may make
it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding
voting stock in addition some provisions of our certificate of incorporation
bylaws and of the delaware general corporation law could also delay prevent
or make more difficult a merger tender offer or proxy contest involving us

financial outlook

from time to time in press releases and otherwise we may publish forecasts or
other forwardlooking statements regarding our results including estimated
revenues or net earnings any forecast of our future performance reflects
various assumptions these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties
and as a matter of course any number of them may prove to be incorrect
further the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other
factors including those described in this discussion many of which are beyond
our control as a result we cannot be certain that our performance will be
consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such
forecasts will not be material and adverse current and potential stockholders
are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of our business and prospects
upon isolated predictions but instead are encouraged to utilize our entire
publicly available mix of historical and forwardlooking information as well as
other available information regarding us our products and services and the
software industry when evaluating our prospective results of operations
