company history 

a leader in freight rail transportation for more than 190 years the company’s heritage dates back to the early nineteenth century when the baltimore and ohio railroad company “bo” the nation’s first common carrier was chartered in 1827 since that time the company has built on this foundation to create a railroad that could safely and reliably service the everincreasing demands of a growing nation since its founding numerous railroads have combined with the former bo through merger and consolidation to create what has become csx each of the railroads that combined into the csx family brought new geographical reach to valuable markets gateways cities ports and transportation corridors 

csx corporation was incorporated in 1978 under virginia law in 1980 the company completed the merger of the chessie system and seaboard coast line industries into csx the merger allowed the company to connect northern population centers and appalachian coal fields to growing southeastern markets later the company’s acquisition of key portions of conrail inc conrail allowed csxt to link the northeast including new england and the new york metropolitan area with chicago and midwestern markets as well as the growing areas in the southeast already served by csxt this current rail network allows the company to directly serve every major market in the eastern united states with safe dependable environmentally responsible and fuel efficient freight transportation and intermodal service 

competition 

the business environment in which the company operates is highly competitive shippers typically select transportation providers that offer the most compelling combination of service and price service requirements both in terms of transit time and reliability vary by shipper and commodity as a result the company’s primary competition varies by commodity geographic location and mode of available transportation and includes other railroads motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and to a less significant extent barges ships and pipelines 

csxt’s primary rail competitor is norfolk southern railway which operates throughout much of the company’s territory other railroads also operate in parts of the company’s territory depending on the specific market competing railroads and deregulated motor carriers may exert pressure on price and service levels for further discussion on the risk of competition to the company see item 1a risk factors

despite the company’s efforts to protect its information technology systems it may not be able to prevent or anticipate all data breaches cyberattacks or other similar incidents detect or react to such incidents in a timely manner or adequately remediate any such incident while csx’s security protocols have detected attempts to gain unauthorized access to the company’s information technology systems none of such attempts have resulted in any material breach of or disruption to the company’s systems for example csx has experienced distributed denial of service attacks that have resulted in brief system disruptions but none have resulted in access to csx systems additionally despite routine security assessment of the company’s key thirdparty vendors some vendors have experienced cyberattacks in the past but none of such attacks have had a material adverse impact on csx’s business or operations due to applicable laws and regulations or contractual obligations csx may be held responsible for data breaches cyberattacks or other similar incidents attributed to its thirdparty vendors as they relate to the information csx shares with them 

network or supply chain constraints could have a negative impact on service operating efficiency or volume of shipments 

csxt could experience rail network difficulties related to i unpredictable increases in demand ii locomotive or crew shortages iii labor shortages or other service disruptions in the supply chain affecting trucking ports handling facilities customer facilities or other railroads iv reductions in availability of pooled equipment including chassis v extreme weather conditions vi impacts from changes in yard capacity or network structure or composition including train routes vii increased passenger activities or viii regulatory changes resulting in forced access or impacting where and how fast csxt can transport freight or maintain routes which could impact csxts operational fluidity leading to deterioration of service asset utilization and overall efficiency 

future acts of terrorism war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the companys operations 

terrorist attacks along with any government response to those attacks may adversely affect the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity csxts rail lines other key infrastructure and information technology systems may be targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war this risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues in addition premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the company could increase dramatically or the coverage may no longer be available 

csx 2021 form 10k p9 

csx corporation

furthermore in response to the heightened risk of terrorism federal state and local governmental bodies are proposing and in some cases have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry for example the department of homeland security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials complying with these or future regulations could continue to increase the companys operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies 

severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage 

the companys operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences including floods fires hurricanes and earthquakes as a result the companys rail network may be damaged its workforce may be unavailable fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur in addition the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions insurance maintained by the company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations depending on the nature of the risk insured this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the companys damages or damages to others and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates even with insurance if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service the company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations 

competitive economic and financial 

the company faces competition from other transportation providers 

the company experiences competition in pricing service reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and to a less significant extent barges ships and pipelines other transportation providers generally use public rightsofway that are built and maintained by governmental entities while csxt and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation such as through the use of automation autonomy or electrification or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks could negatively impact the companys competitive position additionally any future consolidation in the rail industry could materially affect the regulatory and competitive environment in which the company operates 

global economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight 

a decline or disruption in general domestic and global economic conditions that affects demand for the commodities and products the company transports including import and export volume could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects on the companys cost structure and profitability for example slower rates of economic growth in asia contraction of european economies and changes in the global supply of seaborne coal or price of seaborne coal have adverse impacts on us export coal volume and result in lower coal revenue for csx additionally changes to trade agreements or policies could result in reduced import and export volumes due to increased tariffs and lower consumer demand if the company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products the company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs workforce adjustments and other related activities which could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations and liquidity

changing dynamics in the us and global energy markets could negatively impact profitability 

over time changing dynamics in the us and global energy markets have resulted in lower energy production from coalfired power plants in csxs service territory changes in natural gas prices or other factors impacting demand for electricity could impact future power generation at coalfired plants which would affect the companys domestic coal volumes and revenues 

weaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the company’s access to capital 

the company regularly relies on capital markets for the issuance of longterm debt instruments commercial paper and bank financing from time to time instability or disruptions of the capital markets including credit markets or the deterioration of the company’s financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit access and could increase financing costs a significant deterioration of the company’s financial condition could also reduce credit ratings and could limit or affect its access to external sources of capital and increase the costs of short and longterm debt financing 

availability of critical supplies and labor 

the unavailability of critical resources could adversely affect the company’s operational efficiency and ability to meet demand 

marketplace conditions for resources like locomotives as well as the availability of qualified personnel particularly engineers and conductors could each have a negative impact on the company’s ability to meet demand for rail service although the company strives to maintain adequate resources and personnel for the current business environment unpredictable increases in demand for rail services or extreme weather conditions may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on the company’s operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity in a particular period 

disruption to a key railroad industry supplier could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs 

the capital intensive and unique nature of core rail equipment including rail ties rolling stock equipment and locomotives limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers if any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage csxt could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage in addition a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and as such adverse developments in international relations new trade regulations disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase csxts costs additionally if a fuel supply shortage were to arise the company would be negatively impacted 

failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes andor work stoppages 

most of csxs employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements these agreements are either bargained for nationally by the national carriers conference committee or locally between csx and the union such agreements are negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages under the railway labor acts procedures which include mediation coolingoff periods and the possibility of an intervention by the president of the united states during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted if however csx is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements the employees covered by the railway labor act could strike which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members

climate change and environmental 

the company’s operations and financial results could be negatively impacted by climate change and regulatory and legislative responses to climate change 

there is potential for operational impacts from changing weather patterns or rising sea levels in the companys operational territory which could impact the companys network or other assets climate change and other emissionsrelated laws and regulations have been proposed and in some cases adopted on the federal state provincial and local levels these final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions caps taxes or other controls on emissions in particular the epa has issued various regulations and may issue additional regulations targeting emissions including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles 

any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations including any proposed or implemented under the biden administration could adversely affect the companys operations and financial results by among other things i reducing coalfired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards ii reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the united states and canada iii increasing the companys fuel capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies and iv making it difficult for the companys customers in the us and canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner any of these factors could reduce the amount of shipments the company handles and have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs 

the company is subject to wideranging federal state provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions into the air ground and water the handling storage use generation transportation and disposal of waste and other materials the cleanup of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees if the company violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations csx could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators the company can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which csx is responsible in certain circumstances environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties leased properties adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or company predecessors as well as to properties currently owned leased or used by the company 

the company has been and may in the future be subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated or is strictly liable under environmental laws or regulations and such violations can result in the companys incurring fines penalties or costs relating to the cleanup of environmental contamination although the company believes it has appropriately recorded current and longterm liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing the company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination

network geography 

csxt’s operations are primarily focused on four major transportation networks and corridors that are defined geographically and by commodity flows below 

interstate 90 i90 corridor – this csxt corridor links chicago and the midwest to metropolitan areas in new york and new england this route also known as the “waterlevel route” has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks referred to as double track these engineering attributes permit the corridor to support highspeed service across intermodal automotive and merchandise commodities this corridor is a primary route for import traffic coming from the far east through western ports moving eastward across the country through chicago and into the population centers in the northeast the i90 corridor is also a critical link between ports in new york new jersey and pennsylvania and consumption markets in the midwest this route carries goods from all three of the company’s major markets – merchandise intermodal and coal 

interstate 95 i95 corridor – the csxt i95 corridor connects charleston jacksonville miami and many other cities throughout the southeast with the heavily populated midatlantic and northeastern cities of baltimore philadelphia and new york csxt primarily transports food and consumer products as well as metals and chemicals along this line it is the leading rail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of the district of columbia and provides access to major eastern ports 

southeastern corridor – this critical part of the network runs between csxt’s western gateways of chicago st louis and memphis through the cities of nashville birmingham and atlanta and markets in the southeast the southeastern corridor is the premier rail route connecting these key cities gateways and markets and positions csxt to efficiently handle projected traffic volumes of intermodal automotive and general merchandise traffic the corridor also provides direct rail service between the coal reserves of the southern illinois basin and the demand for coal in the southeast 

coal network   – the csxt coal network connects the coal mining operations in the appalachian mountain region and illinois basin with industrial areas in the southeast northeast and midatlantic as well as many river lake and deep water port facilities the domestic coal market has declined significantly over the last decade and export coal remains subject to a high degree of volatility csxt’s coal network remains well positioned to supply utility markets in both the northeast and southeast and to transport coal shipments for export outside of the us approximately onequarter of export coal and the majority of the domestic coal that the company transports is used for generating electricity or industrial purposes 

see the following page for a map of the csx rail network also included on the map csx operating agreement indicates areas within which csx can operate through trackage rights beyond the csx network

material changes in the consolidated balance sheets and working capital 

csxs balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of csxs balanced approach in deploying capital for the benefit of its shareholders which includes investments in infrastructure dividend payments and share repurchases further csx is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint the company ended the year with 23 billion of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

total assets as well as total liabilities and shareholders equity increased 738 million from prior year end the increase in total assets was primarily due to a net increase in property of 571 million attributable to capital expenditures and the consolidation of quality carriers properties the recognition of 393 million of goodwill and intangible assets related to the acquisition of quality carriers a 236 million increase in accounts receivable commensurate with higher revenue and a 226 million increase in net assets for qualified pension plans primarily driven by favorable discount rates these increases were partially offset by the 890 million decrease in cash described above 

total liabilities increased 348 million from year end primarily due to an increase in deferred tax liabilities of 215 million driven by accelerated tax depreciation an increase in accounts payable of 154 million due to the timing of payments an increase in labor and fringe benefit payable of 148 million partly due higher expected incentive compensation payouts the assumption of 68 million in debt as a result of the acquisition of quality carriers and an increase in income and other taxes payable of 61 million these and other increases were offset by debt repayments of 426 million total shareholders equity increased 390 million from year end primarily driven by net earnings of nearly 38 billion mostly offset by share repurchases of 29 billion and dividends paid of 839 million 

working capital is considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its shortterm needs csx had a working capital surplus of 16 billion at december 2021 and 24 billion at december 2020 a decrease of 782 million the decrease in current assets was primarily driven by the net decrease in cash described above partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable the increase in current liabilities was due to higher accounts payable and labor and fringe payable partially offset by lower current maturities of longterm debt 

the company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances although the company currently has a surplus a working capital deficit is not unusual for csx or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity the company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due furthermore csx has sufficient financial capacity including its revolving credit facility commercial paper program and shelf registration statement to manage its daytoday cash requirements and any anticipated obligations the company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity

credit ratings 

credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” and moody’s investors service “moody’s” use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa for sp and moody’s respectively a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 

  

the cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by csxs longterm credit ratings csxs credit ratings remained stable during 2021 as of december 2021 and december 2020 sps longterm rating on csx was bbb stable and moodys was baa1 stable ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sp and moody’s respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade if csxs credit ratings were to decline to below investmentgrade levels the company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt in addition a decline in csx’s credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market’s demand and thus the company’s ability to readily issue new debt the company is committed to maintaining an investmentgrade credit profile

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results may differ from those estimates these estimates and assumptions are discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors on a regular basis significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas 

• personal injury and environmental reserves 

• pension and postretirement medical plan accounting 

• depreciation policies for assets under the grouplife method and 

• goodwill and other intangible assets 

personal injury and environmental reserves 

personal injury 

personal injury reserves of 118 million and 131 million for 2021 and 2020 respectively represent liabilities for employee workrelated and thirdparty injuries csxt retains an independent actuary to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims the methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims it is based largely on csxts historical claims and settlement experience actual results may vary from estimates due to the number type and severity of the injury costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation for additional details including a description of our related accounting policies see note 5 casualty environmental and other reserves in the consolidated financial statements 

environmental 

environmental reserves were 108 million and 76 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively the company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 220 environmentally impaired sites the company reviews its potential liability with respect to each site identified giving consideration to a number of factors such as 

• type of cleanup required 

• nature of the company’s alleged connection to the location eg generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site 

• extent of the company’s alleged connection eg volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors and 

• number connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location

pension and postretirement medical plan accounting 

the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried management personnel for employees hired prior to 2003 the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement for employees hired between 2003 and 2019 benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age service and compensation beginning in 2020 the csx pension plan was closed to new participants as of december 2021 the projected benefit obligation for the company’s pension plans was 30 billion  

in addition to these plans the company sponsors a postretirement medical plan and a life insurance plan that provide certain benefits to fulltime salaried management employees hired prior to 2003 upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met beginning in 2019 both the life insurance benefit for eligible active management employees and health savings account contributions made by the company to eligible retirees younger than 65 were eliminated beginning in 2020 the employerfunded health reimbursement arrangements for eligible retirees 65 years or older were eliminated as of december 2021 the projected benefit obligation for the company’s other postretirement benefit plans was 81 million 

for information related to the funded status of the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans see note 9 employee benefit plans  

the accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the compensationretirement benefits topic in the asc this rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following 

• discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense 

• longterm rate of return on plan assets 

• salary scale inflation rates and 

• other assumptions 

the company engages independent actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the company determines are appropriate based on historical trends current market rates and future projections these amounts are reviewed by management

discount rates 

discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the service and interest cost components of pension and postretirement expense discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other postretirement benefits could be effectively settled or in other words how much it would cost the company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the companys expected future benefit payments the company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of yearend for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans expected benefit payments 

the company measures the service and interest cost components of the net pension and postretirement benefits expense by using individual spot rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year under the spot rate approach individual spot discount rates along the same high quality corporate bonds yield curve used to measure the pension and postretirement benefit liabilities are applied to the relevant projected cash flows at the relevant maturity  

the weighted average discount rates used by the company to value its 2021 pension and postretirement obligations are 278 and 251 respectively for 2020 the weighted average discount rates used by the company to value its pension and postretirement obligations were 243 and 207 respectively discount rates may differ for pension and postretirement benefits due to varying duration of the liabilities for projected payments for each plan as of december 2021 the estimated duration of pensions and postretirement benefits is approximately 12 years and 8 years respectively 

each year these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates in general if interest rates decline or rise the assumed discount rates will change 

longterm rate of return on plan assets 

the expected longterm average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation in estimating that rate the company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds management with the assistance of an outsourced investment manager balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected longterm rate of return on assets as this assumption is long term the annual review may result in less frequent adjustment than other assumptions used in pension accounting the longterm rate of return on plan assets used by the company to value its benefit cost for the subsequent plan year was 675 in both 2021 and 2020 

salary scale inflation rates 

salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the company the company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates the company used a salary scale rate of 460 in both 2021 and 2020 to value its pension obligations 

other assumptions 

the calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to health care cost trend rates mortality rates turnover and retirement age these assumptions are based upon historical data recent plan experience and industry trends and are determined by management

2022 estimated pension and postretirement expense 

net periodic pension and postretirement benefits expenses for 2022 are expected to be credits of 42 million and 5 million respectively net periodic pension and postretirement benefits expenses for 2022 are expected to include service cost expense of 32 million and 1 million respectively service cost expense is included in labor and fringe on the consolidated income statement and all other components of net pension expense and postretirement benefits expense are included in other income  net net periodic pension expense and postretirement benefits expense in 2021 were credits of 17 million and 5 million respectively the net increase in the expected credit is primarily due to impacts from the increase in discount rates and recent favorable pension asset experience 

the following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effects of a 1 change in certain assumptions like discount rates longterm rate of return and salaries on the 2022 estimated pension and postretirement expense 



depreciation policies for assets utilizing the grouplife method 

the depreciable assets of the company are depreciated using either the grouplife or straightline method of accounting which are both acceptable depreciation methods in accordance with gaap the company depreciates its railroad assets including mainline track locomotives and freight cars using the grouplife method of accounting assets depreciated under the grouplife method comprise 86 of total fixed assets of 465 billion on a gross basis at december 31 2021 the remaining depreciable assets of the company including nonrailroad assets and assets under finance leases are depreciated using the straightline method on a per asset basis  land is not depreciated 

management performs a review of depreciation expense and useful lives on a regular basis under the grouplife method the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying management’s methods to determine the service lives of its properties there are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include 

• statistical analysis of historical life and salvage data for each group of property 

• statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property 

• evaluation of current operations 

• evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules 

• previous assessment of the condition of the assets 

• managements outlook on the future use of certain asset groups 

• expected net salvage to be received upon retirement and 

• comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies 

csx 2021 form 10k p43

critical accounting estimates continued   

the stb requires depreciation studies be performed every three years for equipment assets eg locomotives and freight cars and every six years for road and track assets eg bridges signals rail ties and ballast the company completed a depreciation study for its road and track assets in 2020 and for equipment assets in 2019 both of which resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation service lives salvage values and other related factors for certain assets recent experience with depreciation studies has resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation and depreciation rates that did not materially affect the companys depreciation expense of 14 billion 14 billion and 13 billion for 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively a 1 change in the average estimated useful life of all grouplife assets would result in an approximate 12 million change to the company’s annual depreciation expense for additional details including a more detailed description of our related accounting policies see note 6 properties in the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and intangible assets 

as of december 2021 the company had 451 million of goodwill and other intangibles  net csx recognized 213 million of goodwill and 180 million of intangible assets as a result of the quality carriers acquisition effective july 1 2021 

in applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations management must determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between depreciable and amortizable assets and goodwill the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management’s estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques estimates and assumptions include but are not limited to the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weightedaverage cost of capital 

csx evaluates goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist in performing the qualitative impairment assessment csx considers relevant events and conditions including but not limited to macroeconomic trends industry and market conditions overall financial performance companyspecific events and legal and regulatory factors if the qualitative assessments indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts the company would perform a quantitative impairment test if the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill or intangible asset exceeded the fair value under the quantitative test an impairment loss would be recorded measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit could be based on one or more of the following fair value measures amounts at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties present value techniques of estimated future cash flows valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings or revenue or a similar performance measure

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

changes in interest rates may impact the cost of future longterm debt issued by the company and as a result represent interest rate risk to the company in an effort to manage this risk csx may use certain financial instruments such as interest rate forward contracts the following information together with information included in note 10 debt and credit agreements  describes the key aspects of such contracts and the related market risk to csx 

changes in interest rates could impact the fair value of the companys forward starting interest rate swap on both april 29 2020 and july 9 2020 the company executed a forward starting interest rate swap with a notional value of 250 million for an aggregate notional value of 500 million these swaps were effected to hedge the benchmark interest rate associated with future interest payments related to the anticipated refinancing of notes due in 2027 the company recognized an unrealized gain of 8 million and 62 million net of tax during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income with the related asset on the balance sheet as of december 31 2021 upon settlement of the swaps which expire in 2027 the unrealized gain or loss in aoci will be recognized in earnings as an adjustment to interest expense over the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings as of december 31 2021 the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not be material 

as of december 31 2021 csx has no floating rate debt obligations outstanding however changes in interest rates could impact the fair value but not the carrying value of the companys fixed rate longterm debt the potential decrease in fair value of the companys fixed rate longterm debt resulting from a hypothetical 10 increase in us treasury rates or approximately 15 basis points is estimated to be 448 million as of december 31 2021 and 428 million as of december 31 2020 the underlying fair values of the companys longterm debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or on the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities

company history 

a leader in freight rail transportation for more than 190 years the company’s heritage dates back to the early nineteenth century when the baltimore and ohio railroad company “bo” – the nation’s first common carrier – was chartered in 1827 since that time the company has built on this foundation to create a railroad that could safely and reliably service the everincreasing demands of a growing nation 

since its founding numerous railroads have combined with the former bo through merger and consolidation to create what has become csx each of the railroads that combined into the csx family brought new geographical reach to valuable markets gateways cities ports and transportation corridors 

csx corporation was incorporated in 1978 under virginia law in 1980 the company completed the merger of the chessie system and seaboard coast line industries into csx the merger allowed the company to connect northern population centers and appalachian coal fields to growing southeastern markets later the company’s acquisition of key portions of conrail inc conrail allowed csxt to link the northeast including new england and the new york metropolitan area with chicago and midwestern markets as well as the growing areas in the southeast already served by csxt this current rail network allows the company to directly serve every major market in the eastern united states with safe dependable environmentally responsible and fuel efficient freight transportation and intermodal service

competition 

the business environment in which the company operates is highly competitive shippers typically select transportation providers that offer the most compelling combination of service and price service requirements both in terms of transit time and reliability vary by shipper and commodity as a result the company’s primary competition varies by commodity geographic location and mode of available transportation and includes other railroads motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and to a less significant extent barges ships and pipelines 

csxt’s primary rail competitor is norfolk southern railway which operates throughout much of the company’s territory other railroads also operate in parts of the company’s territory depending on the specific market competing railroads and deregulated motor carriers may exert pressure on price and service levels for further discussion on the risk of competition to the company see item 1a risk factors 

regulatory environment 

the companys operations are subject to various federal state provincial canada and local laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses operating in the united states and canada in the us the railroad operations conducted by the companys subsidiaries including csxt are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the surface transportation board “stb” the federal railroad administration “fra” and its sister agency within the us department of transportation dot the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration “phmsa” together fra and phmsa have broad jurisdiction over railroad operating standards and practices including track freight cars locomotives and hazardous materials requirements in addition the us environmental protection agency “epa” has regulatory authority with respect to matters that impact the companys properties and operations 

the transportation security administration “tsa” a component of the department of homeland security has broad authority over railroad operating practices that may have homeland security implications in canada the railroad operations conducted by the company’s subsidiaries including csxt are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the canadian transportation agency 

although the staggers act of 1980 significantly deregulated the us rail industry the stb has broad jurisdiction over rail carriers the stb regulates routes fuel surcharges conditions of service rates for nonexempt traffic acquisitions of control over rail common carriers and the transfer extension or abandonment of rail lines among other railroad activities any new rules from the stb regarding among other things competitive access or revenue adequacy could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations and liquidity as well as its ability to invest in enhancing and maintaining vital infrastructure for further discussion on regulatory risks to the company see item 1a risk factors

competitive economic and financial 

the company faces competition from other transportation providers 

the company experiences competition in pricing service reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and to a less significant extent barges ships and pipelines other transportation providers generally use public rightsofway that are built and maintained by governmental entities while csxt and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation such as through the use of automation autonomy or electrification or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks could negatively impact the companys competitive position additionally any future consolidation in the rail industry could materially affect the regulatory and competitive environment in which the company operates 

global economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight 

a decline or disruption in general domestic and global economic conditions that affects demand for the commodities and products the company transports including import and export volume could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects on the companys cost structure and profitability for example slower rates of economic growth in asia contraction of european economies and changes in the global supply of seaborne coal or price of seaborne coal have adverse impacts on us export coal volume and result in lower coal revenue for csx additionally changes to trade agreements or policies could result in reduced import and export volumes due to increased tariffs and lower consumer demand if the company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products the company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs workforce adjustments and other related activities which could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

  

changing dynamics in the us and global energy markets could negatively impact profitability 

increases in production and source locations of natural gas in the us have resulted in lower natural gas prices in csx’s service territory as a result of sustained low natural gas prices many coalfired power plants have been displaced by natural gasfired power generation facilities if natural gas prices were to remain low additional coalfired plants could be displaced which would likely further reduce the companys domestic coal volumes and revenues additionally crude oil prices combined with changes in pipeline capacity have resulted in volatility in domestic crude oil production which has affected crude oil volumes for csx 

weaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the company’s access to capital 

the company regularly relies on capital markets for the issuance of longterm debt instruments commercial paper and bank financing from time to time instability or disruptions of the capital markets including credit markets or the deterioration of the company’s financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit access and could increase financing costs a significant deterioration of the company’s financial condition could also reduce credit ratings and could limit or affect its access to external sources of capital and increase the costs of short and longterm debt financing

climate change and environmental 

the company’s operations and financial results could be negatively impacted by climate change and regulatory and legislative responses to climate change 

there is potential for operational impacts from changing weather patterns or rising sea levels in the companys operational territory which could impact the companys network or other assets climate change and other emissionsrelated laws and regulations have been proposed and in some cases adopted on the federal state provincial and local levels these final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions caps taxes or other controls on emissions in particular the epa has issued various regulations and may issue additional regulations targeting emissions including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles 

any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations including any proposed or implemented under the biden administration could adversely affect the companys operations and financial results by among other things i reducing coalfired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards ii reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the united states and canada iii increasing the companys fuel capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies and iv making it difficult for the companys customers in the us and canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner any of these factors could reduce the amount of shipments the company handles and have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs 

the company is subject to wideranging federal state provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions into the air ground and water the handling storage use generation transportation and disposal of waste and other materials the cleanup of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees if the company violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations csx could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators the company can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which csx is responsible in certain circumstances environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties leased properties adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or company predecessors as well as to properties currently owned leased or used by the company 

the company has been and may in the future be subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated or is strictly liable under environmental laws or regulations and such violations can result in the companys incurring fines penalties or costs relating to the cleanup of environmental contamination although the company believes it has appropriately recorded current and longterm liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing the company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination

availability of critical supplies and labor 

disruption to a key railroad industry supplier could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs 

the capital intensive and unique nature of core rail equipment including rail ties rolling stock equipment and locomotives limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers if any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage csxt could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage in addition a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and as such adverse developments in international relations new trade regulations disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase csxts costs additionally if a fuel supply shortage were to arise the company would be negatively impacted 

failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes andor work stoppages 

most of csxs employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements these agreements are either bargained for nationally by the national carriers conference committee or locally between csx and the union such agreements are negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages under the railway labor acts procedures which include mediation coolingoff periods and the possibility of an intervention by the president of the united states during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted if however csx is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements the employees covered by the railway labor act could strike which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members 

the unavailability of critical resources could adversely affect the company’s operational efficiency and ability to meet demand 

marketplace conditions for resources like locomotives as well as the availability of qualified personnel particularly engineers and conductors could each have a negative impact on the company’s ability to meet demand for rail service although the company believes that it has adequate resources and personnel for the current business environment unpredictable increases in demand for rail services or extreme weather conditions may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on the company’s operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity in a particular period

network geography 

csxt’s operations are primarily focused on four major transportation networks and corridors that are defined geographically and by commodity flows below 

interstate 90 i90 corridor – this csxt corridor links chicago and the midwest to metropolitan areas in new york and new england this route also known as the “waterlevel route” has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks referred to as double track these engineering attributes permit the corridor to support highspeed service across intermodal automotive and merchandise commodities this corridor is a primary route for import traffic coming from the far east through western ports moving eastward across the country through chicago and into the population centers in the northeast the i90 corridor is also a critical link between ports in new york new jersey and pennsylvania and consumption markets in the midwest this route carries goods from all three of the company’s major markets – merchandise intermodal and coal 

interstate 95 i95 corridor – the csxt i95 corridor connects charleston jacksonville miami and many other cities throughout the southeast with the heavily populated midatlantic and northeastern cities of baltimore philadelphia and new york csxt primarily transports food and consumer products as well as metals and chemicals along this line it is the leading rail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of the district of columbia and provides access to major eastern ports 

southeastern corridor – this critical part of the network runs between csxt’s western gateways of chicago st louis and memphis through the cities of nashville birmingham and atlanta and markets in the southeast the southeastern corridor is the premier rail route connecting these key cities gateways and markets and positions csxt to efficiently handle projected traffic volumes of intermodal automotive and general merchandise traffic the corridor also provides direct rail service between the coal reserves of the southern illinois basin and the demand for coal in the southeast 

coal network   – the csxt coal network connects the coal mining operations in the appalachian mountain region and illinois basin with industrial areas in the southeast northeast and midatlantic as well as many river lake and deep water port facilities the domestic coal market has declined significantly over the last decade and export coal remains subject to a high degree of volatility csxt’s coal network remains well positioned to supply utility markets in both the northeast and southeast and to transport coal shipments for export outside of the us approximately onequarter to onethird of export coal and the majority of the domestic coal that the company transports is used for generating electricity or industrial purposes

global economic uncertainty including the effects of covid19 global pandemic continues to impact the companys results of operations demand for rail services saw large and rapid declines in the first half of the year followed by steep sequential increases in the second half but the effects of the disruption of global manufacturing supply chains and consumer spending as a result of the covid19 pandemic are ongoing while operating cash flows have also been impacted by these economic conditions the company maintains a strong cash balance and access to committed funding sources and other sources of external liquidity if required as this is a dynamic situation it is difficult to determine the future impacts of the pandemic the full implications of covid19 including the extent of its impact on the company’s financial and operating results will be determined by the length of time that the pandemic continues its effect on the demand for the company’s transportation services and the supply chain as well as the effect of governmental regulations imposed in response to the pandemic the duration of the pandemic is dependent on several factors including the timing of vaccine production and distribution as well as the impacts of virus mutations and case resurgences across the country 

csx employees that provide efficient and reliable rail service are essential to keeping supply chains fluid in response to this challenge accordingly business operations have been modified to ensure the safety of employees across the network while continuing to provide a high level of service to customers a crossfunctional task force monitors and coordinates the company’s response to covid19 policies and procedures established to protect the health and safety of employees and customers and to safeguard csx operations include rigorous cleaning regimens for equipment and facilities provision of sanitation supplies distribution of disposable face coverings facilitation of social distancing measures and administration of temperature testing at certain facilities these precautions remain in place despite the easing of pandemic restrictions by state and local governments across the network additionally remote work arrangements have been made where possible in order to reduce the density of employees in a single location and alternative locations for key functions such as dispatch are being utilized as needed 

in march 2020 the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act “cares act” was enacted to provide relief to businesses in response to the covid19 pandemic the most significant remaining impact to the company is the deferral of certain payroll tax payments to 2021 and 2022 the provisions of the cares act are not expected to have an impact on csx’s results of operations or effective tax rate

operating statistics estimated 



a the methodologies for calculating train velocity dwell and cars online differ from those prescribed by the stb as the company believes these numbers more accurately reflect railroad performance csxt will continue to report these metrics using the prescribed methodology to the stb on a weekly basis see additional discussion on the companys website 

certain operating statistics are estimated and can continue to be updated as actuals settle 

key performance measures definitions

dwell  average amount of time in hours between car arrival to and departure from the yard 

cars online  average number of active freight rail cars on lines operated by csx excluding rail cars that are being repaired in storage those that have been sold or private cars dwelling at a customer location more than one day 

revenue tonmiles rtms  the movement of one revenueproducing ton of freight over a distance of one mile

ontime originations  percent of scheduled road trains that depart the origin yard on time or ahead of schedule 

ontime arrivals  percent of scheduled road trains that arrive at the destination yard on time to within two hours of scheduled arrival 

fra personal injury frequency index  number of frareportable injuries per 200000 manhours

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures including those to address regulatory and legislative requirements to have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity its sources and uses of cash balance sheet and external factors should be reviewed 

significant cash flows 

  the following charts highlight the components of the change in cash and cash equivalents for operating investing and financing activities for full years 2020 and 2019 

in 2020 the company generated 43 billion of cash provided by operating activities which was 587 million lower than prior year primarily driven by lower cashgenerating income and unfavorable working capital activities net cash used in investing activities was 649 million a decrease in net spend of 15 billion from the prior year primarily as a result of higher net sales of shortterm investments partially offset by lower proceeds from property dispositions net cash used in financing activities was 14 billion which represents a decrease in net spend of 12 billion from the prior year primarily driven by lower share repurchases partially offset by lower proceeds from debt issuances and higher debt repayments 

sources of cash and liquidity 

the company has multiple sources of liquidity including cash generated from operations and financing sources the company filed a shelf registration statement with the sec in february 2019 which is unlimited as to amount and may be used to issue debt or equity securities at csx’s discretion subject to market conditions and csx board authorization while csx seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit csx to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time or at all in 2020 csx issued a total of 10 billion of new longterm debt

uses of cash 

csx uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes which may include working capital requirements repayment of additional indebtedness outstanding from time to time repurchases of csxs common stock capital investments improvements in productivity and other cost reduction initiatives the company also uses cash for scheduled payments of debt and leases 

in 2020 csx continued to invest in its business to create longterm value for shareholders the company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for longterm profitable growth through optimizing network and terminal capacity funds used for property additions are further described below 



  

planned capital investments for 2021 are expected to be between 17 billion and 18 billion of the total 2021 investment the majority will be used to sustain the core infrastructure and the remaining amounts will be allocated to projects supporting service enhancements productivity initiatives and profitable growth csx intends to fund capital investments through cash generated from operations 

ptc implementation is complete at a total cost of 24 billion which included installing new equipment along tracks upgrading locomotives adding communication equipment and developing new technologies while the company expects ongoing ptc costs future ptc implementation costs are not expected to be material 

csx is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments csx may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors under item 1a of this form 10k

material changes in the consolidated balance sheets and working capital 

csxs balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of csxs balanced approach in deploying capital for the benefit of its shareholders which includes investments in infrastructure dividend payments and share repurchases further csx is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint the company ended the year with 31 billion of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

total assets as well as total liabilities and shareholders equity increased 15 billion from prior year end the increase in assets was primarily due to the net increase of 12 billion in cash and shortterm investments as well as 276 million in net property additions the net increase in cash and shortterm investments was driven by 43 billion in cash from operations and proceeds from the issuance of 10 billion of longterm debt these increases were partially offset by property additions of 16 billion share repurchases of 867 million dividends paid of 797 million and longterm debt repayments of 745 million 

total liabilities increased 289 million from prior year end primarily due to the issuance of 10 billion of longterm debt and a 207 million increase in deferred tax liabilities primarily driven by accelerated tax depreciation these increases were partially offset by debt repayments of 745 million and a 234 million decrease in accounts payable primarily due to the conversion of accounts payable to conrail into notes payable total shareholders equity increased 12 billion from prior year end primarily driven by net earnings of 28 billion partially offset by share repurchases of 867 million and dividends paid of 797 million 

working capital is considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its shortterm needs csx had a working capital surplus of 24 billion at december 2020 and 11 billion at december 2019 an increase of 13 billion the increase in current assets was primarily driven by the net increase in cash and shortterm investments described above and the decrease in current liabilities was due to lower accounts payable partially offset by higher current maturities of longterm debt 

the company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances although the company currently has a surplus a working capital deficit is not unusual for csx or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity the company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due furthermore csx has sufficient financial capacity including its revolving credit facility commercial paper program and shelf registration statement to manage its daytoday cash requirements and any anticipated obligations the company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity

credit ratings 

credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” and moody’s investors service “moody’s” use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa for sp and moody’s respectively a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 

  

the cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by csxs longterm credit ratings csxs credit ratings remained stable during 2020 as of december 2020 and december 2019 sps longterm rating on csx was bbb stable and moodys was baa1 stable ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sp and moody’s respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade if csxs credit ratings were to decline to below investmentgrade levels the company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt in addition a decline in csx’s credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market’s demand and thus the company’s ability to readily issue new debt the company is committed to maintaining an investmentgrade credit profile

in addition to these plans the company sponsors a postretirement medical plan and a life insurance plan that provide certain benefits to fulltime salaried management employees hired prior to 2003 upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met changes to the postretirement medical and life insurance plans were communicated to participants in october 2018 beginning in 2019 both the life insurance benefit for eligible active employees and health savings account contributions made by the company to eligible retirees younger than 65 were eliminated beginning in 2020 the employerfunded health reimbursement arrangements for eligible retirees 65 years or older were eliminated as a result of these plan amendments the company recognized a decrease of 102 million in the postretirement benefit liability and a corresponding gain in other comprehensive income in 2018 as of december 2020 the projected benefit obligation for the company’s other postretirement benefit plans was 96 million 

for information related to the funded status of the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans see note 9 employee benefit plans  

the accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the compensationretirement benefits topic in the asc this rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following 

• discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense 

• longterm rate of return on plan assets 

• salary scale inflation rates and 

• other assumptions 

the company engages independent actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the company determines are appropriate based on historical trends current market rates and future projections these amounts are reviewed by management 

discount rates 

discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the service and interest cost components of pension and postretirement expense discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other postretirement benefits could be effectively settled or in other words how much it would cost the company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the companys expected future benefit payments the company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of yearend for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans expected benefit payments 

the company measures the service and interest cost components of the net pension and postretirement benefits expense by using individual spot rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year under the spot rate approach individual spot discount rates along the same high quality corporate bonds yield curve used to measure the pension and postretirement benefit liabilities are applied to the relevant projected cash flows at the relevant maturity

the weighted average discount rates used by the company to value its 2020 pension and postretirement obligations are 243 percent and 207 percent respectively for 2019 the weighted average discount rates used by the company to value its pension and postretirement obligations were 313 percent and 287 percent respectively discount rates may differ for pension and postretirement benefits due to varying duration of the liabilities for projected payments for each plan as of december 2020 the estimated duration of pensions and postretirement benefits is approximately 12 years and 8 years respectively 

each year these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates in general if interest rates decline or rise the assumed discount rates will change 

longterm rate of return on plan assets 

the expected longterm average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation in estimating that rate the company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds management with the assistance of an outsourced investment manager balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected longterm rate of return on assets as this assumption is long term the annual review may result in less frequent adjustment than other assumptions used in pension accounting the longterm rate of return on plan assets used by the company to value its benefit cost for the subsequent plan year was 675 percent in both 2020 and 2019 

salary scale inflation rates 

salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the company the company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates the company used a salary scale rate of 460 percent in both 2020 and 2019 to value its pension obligations 

other assumptions 

the calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to health care cost trend rates mortality rates turnover and retirement age these assumptions are based upon historical data recent plan experience and industry trends and are determined by management 

2021 estimated pension and postretirement expense 

net periodic pension and postretirement benefits expenses for 2021 are expected to be a 21 million credit and a 5 million credit respectively net periodic pension and postretirement benefits expenses for 2021 are expected to include service cost expense of 38 million and 1 million respectively service cost expense is included in labor and fringe on the consolidated income statement and all other components of net pension expense and postretirement benefits expense are included in other income  net net periodic pension expense and postretirement benefits expense in 2020 were costs of 3 million and less than 1 million respectively the net decrease in the expected expense is primarily due to expected favorable pension asset experience

depreciation policies for assets utilizing the grouplife method 

the depreciable assets of the company are depreciated using either the grouplife or straightline method of accounting which are both acceptable depreciation methods in accordance with gaap the company depreciates its railroad assets including mainline track locomotives and freight cars using the grouplife method of accounting assets depreciated under the grouplife method comprise 87 of total fixed assets of 455 billion on a gross basis at december 31 2020 the remaining depreciable assets of the company including nonrailroad assets and assets under finance leases are depreciated using the straightline method on a per asset basis  land is not depreciated 

management performs a review of depreciation expense and useful lives on a regular basis under the grouplife method the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying management’s methods to determine the service lives of its properties there are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include 

• statistical analysis of historical life and salvage data for each group of property 

• statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property 

• evaluation of current operations 

• evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules 

• previous assessment of the condition of the assets 

• managements outlook on the future use of certain asset groups 

• expected net salvage to be received upon retirement and 

• comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies 

the company completed a depreciation study for its road and track assets in 2020 and for equipment assets in 2019 both of which resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation service lives salvage values and other related factors for certain assets recent experience with depreciation studies has resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation and depreciation rates that did not materially affect the companys depreciation expense of 14 billion 13 billion and 13 billion for 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively a one percent change in the average estimated useful life of all grouplife assets would result in an approximate 12 million change to the company’s annual depreciation expense for additional details including a more detailed description of our related accounting policies see note 6 properties in the consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

changes in interest rates may impact the cost of future longterm debt issued by the company and as a result represent interest rate risk to the company in an effort to manage this risk csx may use certain financial instruments such as interest rate forward contracts the following information together with information included in note 10 debt and credit agreements describes the key aspects of such contracts and the related market risk to csx 

changes in interest rates could impact the fair value of the companys forward starting interest rate swap on both april 29 2020 and july 9 2020 the company executed a forward starting interest rate swap with a notional value of 250 million for an aggregate notional value of 500 million these swaps were effected to hedge the benchmark interest rate associated with future interest payments related to the anticipated refinancing of notes due in 2027 the company recognized an unrealized gain of 62 million net of tax during the year ended december 31 2020 in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income with the related asset on the balance sheet as of december 31 2020 upon settlement of the swaps which expire in 2027 the unrealized gain or loss in aoci will be recognized in earnings as an adjustment to interest expense over the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings as of december 31 2020 the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not be material 

as of december 2020 csx has no floating rate debt obligations outstanding however changes in interest rates could impact the fair value but not the carrying value of the companys fixed rate longterm debt the potential decrease in fair value of the companys fixed rate longterm debt resulting from a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates or approximately 15 basis points is estimated to be 428 million as of december 31 2020 the underlying fair values of the companys longterm debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or on the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities

company history 

a leader in freight rail transportation for more than 190 years the company’s heritage dates back to the early nineteenth century when the baltimore and ohio railroad company “bo” – the nation’s first common carrier – was chartered in 1827 since that time the company has built on this foundation to create a railroad that could safely and reliably service the everincreasing demands of a growing nation 

  

since its founding numerous railroads have combined with the former bo through merger and consolidation to create what has become csx each of the railroads that combined into the csx family brought new geographical reach to valuable markets gateways cities ports and transportation corridors 

  

csx corporation was incorporated in 1978 under virginia law in 1980 the company completed the merger of the chessie system and seaboard coast line industries into csx the merger allowed the company to connect northern population centers and appalachian coal fields to growing southeastern markets later the company’s acquisition of key portions of conrail inc conrail allowed csxt to link the northeast including new england and the new york metropolitan area with chicago and midwestern markets as well as the growing areas in the southeast already served by csxt this current rail network allows the company to directly serve every major market in the eastern united states with safe dependable environmentally responsible and fuel efficient freight transportation and intermodal service 

  

competition 

the business environment in which the company operates is highly competitive shippers typically select transportation providers that offer the most compelling combination of service and price service requirements both in terms of transit time and reliability vary by shipper and commodity as a result the company’s primary competition varies by commodity geographic location and mode of available transportation and includes other railroads motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and to a less significant extent barges ships and pipelines 

  

csxt’s primary rail competitor is norfolk southern railway which operates throughout much of the company’s territory other railroads also operate in parts of the company’s territory depending on the specific market competing railroads and deregulated motor carriers may exert pressure on price and service levels for further discussion on the risk of competition to the company see item 1a risk factors 

regulatory environment 

the companys operations are subject to various federal state provincial canada and local laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses operating in the united states and canada in the us the railroad operations conducted by the companys subsidiaries including csxt are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the surface transportation board “stb” the federal railroad administration “fra” and its sister agency within the us department of transportation dot the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration “phmsa” together fra and phmsa have broad jurisdiction over railroad operating standards and practices including track freight cars locomotives and hazardous materials requirements in addition the us environmental protection agency “epa” has regulatory authority with respect to matters that impact the companys properties and operations 

the transportation security administration “tsa” a component of the department of homeland security has broad authority over railroad operating practices that may have homeland security implications in canada the railroad operations conducted by the company’s subsidiaries including csxt are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the canadian transportation agency

although the staggers act of 1980 significantly deregulated the us rail industry the stb has broad jurisdiction over rail carriers the stb regulates routes fuel surcharges conditions of service rates for nonexempt traffic acquisitions of control over rail common carriers and the transfer extension or abandonment of rail lines among other railroad activities any new rules from the stb regarding among other things competitive access or revenue adequacy could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations and liquidity as well as its ability to invest in enhancing and maintaining vital infrastructure for further discussion on regulatory risks to the company see item 1a risk factors  

positive train control 

in 2008 congress enacted the rail safety improvement act the “rsia” the legislation included a mandate that all class i freight railroads implement an interoperable positive train control system “ptc” by december 31 2015 implementation of a ptc system is designed to prevent traintotrain collisions overspeed derailments incursions into established workzone limits and train diversions onto another set of tracks ptc must be installed on all main lines with passenger and commuter operations as well as most of those over which toxicbyinhalation hazardous materials are transported 

on october 29 2015 the president of the united states signed the positive train control enforcement and implementation act of 2015 into law extending the deadline in accordance with this act the company completed installation of all ptc hardware by december 31 2018 the company met all criteria required by the act to be approved for an extension by the fra the ptc system is now required to be fully operational by december 31 2020 csx remains on track to meet this regulatory requirement 

the company expects to continue incurring capital costs in connection with the implementation of ptc as well as related ongoing operating expenses csx currently estimates that the total multiyear cost of ptc implementation will be approximately 24 billion for the company total ptc investment through 2019 was  23 billion

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the companys forwardlooking statements additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the company or that the company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

new legislation or regulatory changes could impact the companys earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices 

legislation passed by congress new regulations issued by federal agencies or executive orders issued by the president of the united states could significantly affect the revenues costs and profitability of the companys business in addition statutes or regulations imposing price constraints or affecting railtorail competition could adversely affect the companys profitability 

  

government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the companys operations and financial results 

the company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies including the stb fra phmsa tsa epa and other state provincial and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic health safety labor environmental tax legal and other matters new or modified rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the companys operating costs adversely impact revenue or reduce operating efficiencies and affect service performance for example the rsia as amended mandated that the installation of ptc hardware be completed by december 31 2018 and requires that the ptc system be fully operational by december 31 2020 on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that have commuter or passenger operations although csx remains on track to meet this regulatory requirement noncompliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the company and can subject the company to fines penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions 

csxt as a common carrier by rail is required by law to transport hazardous materials which could expose the company to significant costs and claims 

a train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury property or natural resource damage environmental penalties and remediation obligations such claims if insured could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates under federal regulations csxt is required to transport hazardous materials under the legal duty referred to as the common carrier mandate 

csxt is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials in november 2008 the tsa issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail noncompliance with these rules can subject the company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident finally legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances which could increase operating costs reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials

the company experiences competition in pricing service reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and to a less significant extent barges ships and pipelines other transportation providers generally use public rightsofway that are built and maintained by governmental entities while csxt and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation such as through the use of automation autonomy or electrification or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks could negatively impact the companys competitive position additionally any future consolidation in the rail industry could materially affect the regulatory and competitive environment in which the company operates 

global economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight 

a decline or disruption in general domestic and global economic conditions that affects demand for the commodities and products the company transports including import and export volume could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects on the companys cost structure and profitability for example slower rates of economic growth in asia contraction of european economies and changes in the global supply of seaborne coal or price of seaborne coal have adverse impacts on us export coal volume and result in lower coal revenue for csx additionally changes to trade agreements or policies could result in reduced import and export volumes due to increased tariffs and lower consumer demand if the company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products the company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs workforce adjustments and other related activities which could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

  

changing dynamics in the us and global energy markets could negatively impact profitability 

increases in production and source locations of natural gas in the us have resulted in lower natural gas prices in csx’s service territory as a result of sustained low natural gas prices many coalfired power plants have been displaced by natural gasfired power generation facilities if natural gas prices were to remain low additional coalfired plants could be displaced which would likely further reduce the companys domestic coal volumes and revenues additionally crude oil prices combined with increased pipeline activity have resulted in volatility in domestic crude oil production which has affected crude oil volumes for csx 

the company relies on the security stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business 

the company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business the performance and reliability of the companys technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively a cybersecurity attack which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems or other significant disruption or failure could result in a service interruption train accident misappropriation of confidential information process failure security breach or other operational difficulties such an event could result in decreased revenues and increased capital insurance or operating costs including increased security costs to protect the companys infrastructure insurance maintained by the company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from cyber incidents may not be sufficient to cover all damages a disruption or compromise of the companys information technology systems even for short periods of time could have a material adverse effect

the company’s operations and financial results could be negatively impacted by climate change and regulatory and legislative responses to climate change 

there is potential for operational impacts from changing weather patterns or rising sea levels in the companys operational territory which could impact the companys network or other assets climate change and other emissionsrelated laws and regulations have been proposed and in some cases adopted on the federal state provincial and local levels these final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions caps taxes or other controls on emissions in particular the epa has issued various regulations and may issue additional regulations targeting emissions including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles 

any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations could adversely affect the companys operations and financial results by among other things i reducing coalfired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards ii reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the united states and canada iii increasing the companys fuel capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies and iv making it difficult for the companys customers in the us and canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner any of these factors could reduce the amount of shipments the company handles and have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs 

the company is subject to wideranging federal state provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions into the air ground and water the handling storage use generation transportation and disposal of waste and other materials the cleanup of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees if the company violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations csx could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators the company can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which csx is responsible in certain circumstances environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties leased properties adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or company predecessors as well as to properties currently owned leased or used by the company 

the company has been and may in the future be subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated or is strictly liable under environmental laws or regulations and such violations can result in the companys incurring fines penalties or costs relating to the cleanup of environmental contamination although the company believes it has appropriately recorded current and longterm liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing the company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination 

the company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures 

as part of its railroad and other operations the company is subject to various claims and lawsuits related to disputes over commercial practices labor and unemployment matters occupational and personal injury claims property damage environmental and other matters the company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits although the company maintains insurance to cover some of these types of claims and establishes reserves when appropriate final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may exceed the companys insurance coverage or differ materially from the recorded reserves additionally the company could be impacted by adverse developments not currently reflected in the companys reserve estimates

disruption to a key railroad industry supplier could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs 

the capital intensive and unique nature of core rail equipment including rolling stock equipment locomotives rail and ties limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers if any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage csxt could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage in addition a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and as such adverse developments in international relations new trade regulations disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase csxts operating costs additionally if a fuel supply shortage were to arise the company would be negatively impacted 

network constraints could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency 

csxt could experience rail network difficulties related to i increased volume ii locomotive or crew shortages iii extreme weather conditions iv impacts from changes in yard capacity or network structure or composition including train routes v increased passenger activities or vi regulatory changes impacting where and how fast csxt can transport freight or maintain routes which could impact csxts operational fluidity leading to deterioration of service asset utilization and overall efficiency 

future acts of terrorism war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the companys operations 

terrorist attacks along with any government response to those attacks may adversely affect the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity csxts rail lines other key infrastructure and information technology systems may be targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war this risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues in addition premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the company could increase dramatically or the coverage may no longer be available 

  

furthermore in response to the heightened risk of terrorism federal state and local governmental bodies are proposing and in some cases have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry for example the department of homeland security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials complying with these or future regulations could continue to increase the companys operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies 

severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage 

the companys operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences including floods fires hurricanes and earthquakes as a result the companys rail network may be damaged its workforce may be unavailable fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur in addition the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions insurance maintained by the company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations depending on the nature of the risk insured this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the companys damages or damages to others and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates even with insurance if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service the company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations

failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes andor work stoppages 

most of csxs employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements these agreements are either bargained for nationally by the national carriers conference committee or locally between csx and the union such agreements are negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages under the railway labor acts procedures which include mediation coolingoff periods and the possibility of an intervention by the president of the united states during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted if however csx is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements the employees covered by the railway labor act could strike which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members 

the unavailability of critical resources could adversely affect the company’s operational efficiency and ability to meet demand 

marketplace conditions for resources like locomotives as well as the availability of qualified personnel particularly engineers and conductors could each have a negative impact on the company’s ability to meet demand for rail service although the company believes that it has adequate resources and personnel for the current business environment unpredictable increases in demand for rail services or extreme weather conditions may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on the company’s operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity in a particular period 

weaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the company’s access to capital 

the company regularly relies on capital markets for the issuance of longterm debt instruments commercial paper and bank financing from time to time instability or disruptions of the capital markets including credit markets or the deterioration of the company’s financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit access and could increase financing costs a significant deterioration of the company’s financial condition could also reduce credit ratings and could limit or affect its access to external sources of capital and increase the costs of short and longterm debt financing

 item 2 properties 

  

the company’s properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure locomotives and freight cars and equipment these categories and the geography of the network are described below 

track and infrastructure 

serving 23 states the district of columbia and the canadian provinces of ontario and quebec the csxt rail network serves among other markets new york philadelphia and boston in the northeast and midatlantic the southeast markets of atlanta miami and new orleans and the midwestern markets of st louis memphis and chicago 

csxt’s track structure includes mainline track connecting terminals and yards track within terminals and switching yards sidings used for passing trains track connecting csxts track to customer locations and track that diverts trains from one track to another known as turnouts total track miles which reflect the size of csxt’s network that connects markets customers and western railroads are greater than csxt’s approximately 20000 route miles at december 2019  the breakdown of track miles was as follows 



in addition to its physical track structure the company operates numerous yards and terminals for rail and intermodal service these serve as points of connectivity between the company and its local customers and as sorting facilities where railcars and intermodal containers are received classed for destination and placed onto outbound trains or arrive and are delivered to the customer the company’s largest yards and terminals based on 2019 volume number of railcars or intermodal containers processed are listed below

network geography 

csxt’s operations are primarily focused on four major transportation networks and corridors which are defined geographically and by commodity flows below 

interstate 90 i90 corridor – this csxt corridor links chicago and the midwest to metropolitan areas in new york and new england this route also known as the “waterlevel route” has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks referred to as double track these engineering attributes permit the corridor to support highspeed service across intermodal automotive and merchandise commodities this corridor is a primary route for import traffic coming from the far east through western ports moving eastward across the country through chicago and into the population centers in the northeast the i90 corridor is also a critical link between ports in new york new jersey and pennsylvania and consumption markets in the midwest this route carries goods from all three of the company’s major markets – merchandise coal and intermodal 

interstate 95 i95 corridor – the csxt i95 corridor connects charleston jacksonville miami and many other cities throughout the southeast with the heavily populated midatlantic and northeastern cities of baltimore philadelphia and new york csxt primarily transports food and consumer products as well as metals and chemicals along this line it is the leading rail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of the district of columbia and provides access to major eastern ports 

southeastern corridor – this critical part of the network runs between csxt’s western gateways of chicago st louis and memphis through the cities of nashville birmingham and atlanta and markets in the southeast the southeastern corridor is the premier rail route connecting these key cities gateways and markets and positions csxt to efficiently handle projected traffic volumes of intermodal automotive and general merchandise traffic the corridor also provides direct rail service between the coal reserves of the southern illinois basin and the demand for coal in the southeast 

coal network   – the csxt coal network connects the coal mining operations in the appalachian mountain region and illinois basin with industrial areas in the southeast northeast and midatlantic as well as many river lake and deep water port facilities the domestic coal market has declined significantly over the last decade and export coal remains subject to a high degree of volatility csxt’s coal network remains well positioned to supply utility markets in both the northeast and southeast and to transport coal shipments for export outside of the us roughly onethird of the tons of export coal and the majority of the domestic coal that the company transports is used for generating electricity 

see the following page for a map of the csx rail network also included on the map csx operating agreement indicates areas within which csx can operate through trackage rights beyond the csx network

nongaap measures  unaudited 

csx reports its financial results in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap csx also uses certain nongaap measures that fall within the meaning of securities and exchange commission regulation g and regulation sk item 10e which may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparison to prior reported results nongaap measures do not have standardized definitions and are not defined by gaap therefore csx’s nongaap measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies the presentation of these nongaap measures should not be considered in isolation from as a substitute for or as superior to the financial information presented in accordance with gaap reconciliations of nongaap measures to corresponding gaap measures are below 

2017 adjusted operating results 

management believes that adjusted operating income adjusted operating ratio adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share assuming dilution are important in evaluating the company’s operating performance and for planning and forecasting future business operations and future profitability these nongaap measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating results because they exclude certain significant items that are not considered indicative of future financial trends 

the impact of tax reform and the restructuring charge on 2017 operating results are shown in the following table there were no adjustments to operating results in 2018 or 2019

liquidity and capital resources

in 2019  the company generated 49 billion of cash provided by operating activities which was 209 million higher than prior year primarily driven by favorable working capital activities and higher cashgenerating income in 2018 the company generated 46 billion of cash provided by operating activities which was 12 billion higher than the prior year primarily driven by higher cashgenerating income which included the impact of a lower income tax rate partially offset by lower working capital and other activities 

in 2019  net cash used in investing activities was 21 billion  an increase in net spend of 418 million from the prior year primarily driven by an increase in net purchases of shortterm investments in 2018 net cash used in investing activities was 17 billion an increase of 189 million from the prior year primarily driven by an increase in net shortterm investment purchases partially offset by lower property additions and higher proceeds from property dispositions 

in 2019 net cash used in financing activities was 26 billion  which represents an increase in net spend of 148 million from the prior year primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and higher debt repayments partially offset by lower share repurchases in 2018 net cash used in financing activities was 25 billion which represents an increase of 321 million from the prior year primarily driven by higher share repurchases partially offset by higher net debt issued

sources of cash and liquidity 

the company has multiple sources of liquidity including cash generated from operations and financing sources the company filed a shelf registration statement with the sec in february 2019 which is unlimited as to amount and may be used to issue debt or equity securities at csx’s discretion subject to market conditions and csx board authorization while csx seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit csx to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time or at all in 2019  csx issued a total of 20 billion of new longterm debt 

csx has access to a 12 billion fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks that expires in march 2024 as of december 31 2019 the company had no outstanding balances under this facility see note 10 debt and credit agreements for more information the company also has a commercial paper program backed by the revolving credit facility under which the company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of 10 billion outstanding at any one time at december 31 2019 the company had no outstanding debt under the commercial paper program 

uses of cash 

csx uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes which may include working capital requirements repayment of additional indebtedness outstanding from time to time repurchases of csxs common stock capital investments improvements in productivity and other cost reduction initiatives 

in 2019 csx continued to invest in its business to create longterm value for shareholders the company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for longterm profitable growth through optimizing network and terminal capacity funds used for property additions are further described below 



planned capital investments for 2020 are expected to be between 16 billion and 17 billion of the 2020 investment the majority will be used to sustain the core infrastructure the remaining amounts will be allocated to projects supporting service enhancements productivity initiatives and profitable growth csx intends to fund capital investments through cash generated from operations 

the company expects to continue incurring capital costs in connection with the implementation of ptc csx estimates that the total multiyear cost of ptc implementation will be approximately  24 billion  this estimate includes costs for installing the new system along tracks upgrading locomotives adding communication equipment and developing new technologies total ptc spending through 2019 was  23 billion

csx is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments csx may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors under item 1a of this form 10k 

the company also uses cash for scheduled payments of debt and leases share repurchases and to pay dividends to shareholders on february 12 2020 the companys board of directors authorized an 8 increase in the quarterly cash dividend to 026 per common share 

material changes in the consolidated balance sheets and working capital 

csxs balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of csxs balanced approach in deploying capital for the benefit of its shareholders which includes investments in infrastructure dividend payments and share repurchases further csx is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint the company ended the year with 20 billion of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

total assets as well as total liabilities and shareholders equity increased 15 billion from prior year the increase in assets was primarily due to the net increase in shortterm investments of 743 million the rightofuse lease asset of 532 million resulting from the adoption of the new lease accounting standard and property additions net of retirements of 295 million the increase in total liabilities and shareholders equity combined was driven by net earnings of 33 billion the issuance of 20 billion in longterm debt and the total lease liability of 550 million resulting from the adoption of the new lease accounting standard these increases were partially offset by share repurchases of 34 billion and dividends paid of 763 million 

working capital is considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its shortterm needs csx had a working capital surplus of 11 billion at december 2019 and 650 million at december 2018  the increase in current assets was primarily driven by cash proceeds from the 20 billion issuance of longterm debt partially offset by dividend payments of 763 million and the early redemption of longterm debt originally due october 2020 of 500 million the increase in current assets was offset by an increase in current liabilities primarily due to the reclassification of 245 million from longterm debt to current maturities of longterm debt 

the company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above although the company currently has a surplus a working capital deficit is not unusual for csx or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity the company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due furthermore csx has sufficient financial capacity including its revolving credit facility commercial paper program and shelf registration statement to manage its daytoday cash requirements and any anticipated obligations the company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity 

credit ratings 

credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” and moody’s investors service “moody’s” use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa for sp and moody’s respectively a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency

the cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by csxs longterm credit ratings csxs credit ratings remained stable during 2019  as of december 2019 and december 2018  sps longterm rating on csx was bbb stable and moodys was baa1 stable ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sp and moody’s respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade if csxs credit ratings were to decline to below investment grade levels the company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt in addition a decline in csx’s credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market’s demand and thus the company’s ability to readily issue new debt 

csx is committed to returning cash to shareholders and maintaining an investment grade credit profile capital structure capital investments and cash distributions including dividends and share repurchases are reviewed at least annually by the board of directors

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results may differ from those estimates these estimates and assumptions are discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors on a regular basis significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas 

 

personal injury environmental and legal reserves 

personal injury 

personal injury reserves of 129 million and 143 million for 2019 and 2018  respectively represent liabilities for employee workrelated and thirdparty injuries csxt retains an independent actuary to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims the methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims it is based largely on csxts historical claims and settlement experience actual results may vary from estimates due to the number type and severity of the injury costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation for additional details including a description of our related accounting policies see note 5 casualty environmental and other reserves in the consolidated financial statements

legal 

the company is involved in litigation incidental to its business and is a party to a number of legal actions and claims various governmental proceedings and private civil lawsuits the company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate the amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings newly discovered or developed evidence or changes in laws regulations and evidentiary standards an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity in that particular period for additional details including a description of our related accounting policies see note 5 casualty environmental and other reserves in the consolidated financial statements additionally see item 3 legal proceedings for further discussion of these items 

pension and postretirement medical plan accounting 

the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried management personnel for employees hired prior to 2003 the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement for employees hired in 2003 or thereafter benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age service and compensation beginning in 2020 the csx pension plan is closed to new participants as of december 2019  the projected benefit obligation for the company’s pension plans was 31 billion  

in addition to these plans the company sponsors a postretirement medical plan and a noncontributory life insurance plan that provide certain benefits to fulltime salaried management employees hired prior to 2003 upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met beginning in 2019 both the life insurance benefit for eligible active employees and health savings account contributions made by the company to eligible retirees younger than 65 were eliminated beginning in 2020 the employerfunded health reimbursement arrangements for eligible retirees 65 years or older were eliminated as a result of these plan amendments the company recognized a decrease in 2018 of 102 million in the postretirement benefit liability as of december 2019  the projected benefit obligation for the company’s other postretirement benefit plans was 117 million

for information related to the funded status of the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans see note 9 employee benefit plans  

the accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the compensationretirement benefits topic in the asc this rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following 

 

the company engages independent actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the company determines are appropriate based on historical trends current market rates and future projections these amounts are reviewed by management 

discount rates 

discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the service and interest cost components of pension and postretirement expense discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other postretirement benefits could be effectively settled or in other words how much it would cost the company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the companys expected future benefit payments the company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of yearend for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans expected benefit payments 

the company measures the service and interest cost components of the net pension and postretirement benefits expense by using individual spot rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year under the spot rate approach individual spot discount rates along the same high quality corporate bonds yield curve used to measure the pension and postretirement benefit liabilities are applied to the relevant projected cash flows at the relevant maturity  

the weighted average discount rates used by the company to value its 2019 pension and postretirement obligations are 313 percent and 287 percent  respectively for 2018  the weighted average discount rates used by the company to value its pension and postretirement obligations were 424 percent and 398 percent  respectively discount rates may differ for pension and postretirement benefits due to varying duration of the liabilities for projected payments for each plan as of december 2019  the estimated duration of pensions and postretirement benefits is approximately 12 years and 7 years respectively 

each year these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates in general if interest rates decline or rise the assumed discount rates will change

critical accounting estimates continued 

longterm rate of return on plan assets 

the expected longterm average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation in estimating that rate the company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected longterm rate of return on assets as this assumption is longterm the annual review may result in less frequent adjustment than other assumptions used in pension accounting the longterm rate of return on plan assets used by the company to value its benefit cost for the subsequent plan year was 675 percent in both 2019 and 2018  

salary scale inflation rates 

salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the company the company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates the company used a salary scale rate of 460 percent in both 2019 and 2018 to value its pension obligations 

other assumptions 

the calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to health care cost trend rates mortality rates turnover and retirement age these assumptions are based upon historical data recent plan experience and industry trends and are determined by management 

2020 estimated pension and postretirement expense 

net periodic pension and postretirement benefits expenses for 2020 are expected to be a 5 million expense and a 2 million credit respectively net periodic pension and postretirement benefits expenses for 2020 are expected to include service cost expense of 40 million and 1 million respectively service cost expense is included in labor and fringe on the consolidated income statement and all other components of net pension expense and postretirement benefits expense are included in other income  net net periodic pension expense and postretirement benefits expense in 2019 were credits of 7 million and 4 million  respectively the net increase in the expected expense is primarily due to impacts from the decline in discount rates partially offset by favorable pension asset experience 

the following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effects of a one percent change in certain assumptions like discount rates longterm rate of return and salaries on the 2020 estimated pension and postretirement expense

depreciation policies for assets utilizing the grouplife method 

the depreciable assets of the company are depreciated using either the grouplife or straightline method of accounting which are both acceptable depreciation methods in accordance with gaap the company depreciates its railroad assets including mainline track locomotives and freight cars using the grouplife method of accounting assets depreciated under the grouplife method comprise 87 of total fixed assets of 45 billion on a gross basis at december 31 2019  the remaining depreciable assets of the company including nonrailroad assets and assets under finance leases are depreciated using the straightline method on a per asset basis  land is not depreciated 

management performs a review of depreciation expense and useful lives on a regular basis under the grouplife method the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying management’s methods to determine the service lives of its properties there are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include 

 

in 2019 the company completed a depreciation study for its equipment assets which resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation service lives salvage values and other related factors for certain assets the effect of this change in estimate was not material to depreciation expense in 2019 the continued impacts of the study are expected to result in additional depreciation expense of approximately 30 million in 2020 there were no depreciation studies in 2018 or 2017 a one percent change in the average estimated useful life of all grouplife assets would result in an approximate 12 million change to the company’s annual depreciation expense for additional details including a more detailed description of our related accounting policies see note 6 properties in the consolidated financial statements

see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for operating revenue operating income and total assets for each of the last three fiscal years 

company history 

a leader in freight rail transportation for more than 190 years the company’s heritage dates back to the early nineteenth century when the baltimore and ohio railroad company “bo” – the nation’s first common carrier – was chartered in 1827 since that time the company has built on this foundation to create a railroad that could safely and reliably service the everincreasing demands of a growing nation 

  

since its founding numerous railroads have combined with the former bo through merger and consolidation to create what has become csx each of the railroads that combined into the csx family brought new geographical reach to valuable markets gateways cities ports and transportation corridors 

  

csx was incorporated in 1978 under virginia law in 1980 the company completed the merger of the chessie system and seaboard coast line industries into csx the merger allowed the company to connect northern population centers and appalachian coal fields to growing southeastern markets later the company’s acquisition of key portions of conrail inc conrail allowed csxt to link the northeast including new england and the new york metropolitan area with chicago and midwestern markets as well as the growing areas in the southeast already served by csxt this current rail network allows the company to directly serve every major market in the eastern united states with safe dependable environmentally responsible and fuel efficient freight transportation and intermodal service 

  

competition 

the business environment in which the company operates is highly competitive shippers typically select transportation providers that offer the most compelling combination of service and price service requirements both in terms of transit time and reliability vary by shipper and commodity as a result the company’s primary competition varies by commodity geographic location and mode of available transportation and includes other railroads motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and to a less significant extent barges ships and pipelines 

  

csxt’s primary rail competitor is norfolk southern railway which operates throughout much of the company’s territory other railroads also operate in parts of the company’s territory depending on the specific market competing railroads and deregulated motor carriers may exert pressure on price and service levels for further discussion on the risk of competition to the company see item 1a risk factors 

regulatory environment 

the companys operations are subject to various federal state provincial canada and local laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses operating in the united states and canada in the us the railroad operations conducted by the companys subsidiaries including csxt are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the surface transportation board “stb” the federal railroad administration “fra” and its sister agency within the us department of transportation dot the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration “phmsa” together fra and phmsa have broad jurisdiction over railroad operating standards and practices including track freight cars locomotives and hazardous materials requirements in addition the us environmental protection agency “epa” has regulatory authority with respect to matters that impact the companys properties and operations 

the transportation security administration “tsa” a component of the department of homeland security has broad authority over railroad operating practices that may have homeland security implications in canada the railroad operations conducted by the company’s subsidiaries including csxt are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the canadian transportation agency

although the staggers act of 1980 significantly deregulated the us rail industry the stb has broad jurisdiction over rail carriers the stb regulates routes fuel surcharges conditions of service rates for nonexempt traffic acquisitions of control over rail common carriers and the transfer extension or abandonment of rail lines among other railroad activities 

positive train control 

in 2008 congress enacted the rail safety improvement act the “rsia” the legislation included a mandate that all class i freight railroads implement an interoperable positive train control system “ptc” by december 31 2015 implementation of a ptc system is designed to prevent traintotrain collisions overspeed derailments incursions into established workzone limits and train diversions onto another set of tracks on october 29 2015 the president of the united states signed the positive train control enforcement and implementation act of 2015 into law extending the deadline in accordance with this act the company completed installation of all ptc hardware by december 31 2018 as the company has met all criteria required by the act and been approved for an extension by the fra the ptc system is now required to be fully operational by december 31 2020 csx remains on track to meet this regulatory requirement 

ptc must be installed on all main lines with passenger and commuter operations as well as most of those over which toxicbyinhalation hazardous materials are transported the company expects to continue incurring capital costs in connection with the implementation of ptc as well as related ongoing operating expenses csx currently estimates that the total multiyear cost of ptc implementation will be approximately 24 billion  for the company total ptc investment through 2018  was  22 billion

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the companys forwardlooking statements additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the company or that the company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

new legislation or regulatory changes could impact the companys earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices 

legislation passed by congress new regulations issued by federal agencies or executive orders issued by the president of the united states could significantly affect the revenues costs and profitability of the companys business in addition statutes imposing price constraints or affecting railtorail competition could adversely affect the companys profitability 

  

government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the companys operations and financial results 

the company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies including the stb fra phmsa tsa epa and other state provincial and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic health safety labor environmental tax legal and other matters new or modified rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the companys operating costs or reduce operating efficiencies and impact service performance for example the rsia as amended mandated that the installation of ptc hardware be completed by december 31 2018 and requires that the ptc system be fully operational by december 31 2020 on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that have commuter or passenger operations although csx remains on track to meet this regulatory requirement noncompliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the company and can subject the company to fines penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions 

csxt as a common carrier by rail is required by law to transport hazardous materials which could expose the company to significant costs and claims 

a train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury property or natural resource damage environmental penalties and remediation obligations such claims if insured could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates under federal regulations csxt is required to transport hazardous materials under the legal duty referred to as the common carrier mandate 

csxt is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials in november 2008 the tsa issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail noncompliance with these rules can subject the company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident finally legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances which could increase operating costs reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials 

network constraints could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency 

csxt could experience rail network difficulties related to i increased volume ii locomotive or crew shortages iii extreme weather conditions iv impacts from changes in yard capacity or network structure or composition including train routes v increased passenger activities or vi regulatory changes impacting where and how fast csxt can transport freight or maintain routes which could have a negative effect on csxts operational fluidity leading to deterioration of service asset utilization and overall efficiency

global economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight 

a decline or disruption in general domestic and global economic conditions that affects demand for the commodities and products the company transports including import and export volume could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects on the companys cost structure and profitability for example if the rate of economic growth in asia slows european economies contract or if the global supply of seaborne coal or price of seaborne coal changes from its current levels us export coal volume could be adversely impacted resulting in lower revenue for csx additionally changes to trade agreements or policies could result in reduced import and export volumes due to increased tariffs and lower consumer demand if the company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products the company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs workforce adjustments and other related activities which could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

  

changing dynamics in the us and global energy markets could negatively impact profitability 

increases in production and source locations of natural gas in the us have resulted in lower natural gas prices in csx’s service territory as a result of sustained low natural gas prices many coalfired power plants have been displaced by natural gasfired power generation facilities if natural gas prices were to remain low additional coalfired plants could be displaced which would likely further reduce the companys domestic coal volumes and revenues additionally crude oil prices combined with increased pipeline activity have resulted in volatility in domestic crude oil production which has affected crude oil volumes for csx 

the company relies on the security stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business 

the company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business the performance and reliability of the companys technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively a cybersecurity attack which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems or other significant disruption or failure could result in a service interruption train accident misappropriation of confidential information process failure security breach or other operational difficulties such an event could result in decreased revenues and increased capital insurance or operating costs including increased security costs to protect the companys infrastructure insurance maintained by the company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from cyber incidents may not be sufficient to cover all damages a disruption or compromise of the companys information technology systems even for short periods of time could have a material adverse effect 

climate change and other emissionsrelated laws and regulations could adversely affect the companys operations and financial results 

climate change and other emissionsrelated laws and regulations have been proposed and in some cases adopted on the federal state provincial and local levels these final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions caps taxes or other controls on emissions in particular the epa has issued various regulations and may issue additional regulations targeting emissions including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles 

any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations could adversely affect the companys operations and financial results by among other things i reducing coalfired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards ii reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the united states and canada iii increasing the companys fuel capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies and iv making it difficult for the companys customers in the us and canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner any of these factors could reduce the amount of shipments the company handles and have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity

the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs 

the company is subject to wideranging federal state provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions into the air ground and water the handling storage use generation transportation and disposal of waste and other materials the cleanup of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees if the company violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations csx could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators the company can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which csx is responsible in certain circumstances environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties leased properties adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or company predecessors as well as to properties currently owned leased or used by the company 

the company has been and may in the future be subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated or is strictly liable under environmental laws or regulations and such violations can result in the companys incurring fines penalties or costs relating to the cleanup of environmental contamination although the company believes it has appropriately recorded current and longterm liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing the company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination 

disruption of the supply chain could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs 

the capital intensive nature and sophistication of core rail equipment including rolling stock equipment locomotives rail and ties limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers if any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage csxt could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage in addition a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and as such adverse developments in international relations new trade regulations disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase csxts operating costs additionally if a fuel supply shortage were to arise the company would be negatively impacted 

the company faces competition from other transportation providers 

the company experiences competition in pricing service reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and to a less significant extent barges ships and pipelines other transportation providers generally use public rightsofway that are built and maintained by governmental entities while csxt and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation such as through the use of automation autonomy or electrification or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks could negatively impact the companys competitive position additionally any future consolidation in the rail industry could materially affect the regulatory and competitive environment in which the company operates

future acts of terrorism war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the companys operations 

terrorist attacks along with any government response to those attacks may adversely affect the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity csxts rail lines other key infrastructure and information technology systems may be targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war this risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues in addition premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the company could increase dramatically or the coverage may no longer be available 

  

furthermore in response to the heightened risk of terrorism federal state and local governmental bodies are proposing and in some cases have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry for example the department of homeland security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials complying with these or future regulations could continue to increase the companys operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies 

severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage 

the companys operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences including floods fires hurricanes and earthquakes as a result the companys rail network may be damaged its workforce may be unavailable fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur in addition the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions insurance maintained by the company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations depending on the nature of the risk insured this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the companys damages or damages to others and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates even with insurance if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service the company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations 

the company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures 

as part of its railroad and other operations the company is subject to various claims and lawsuits related to disputes over commercial practices labor and unemployment matters occupational and personal injury claims property damage environmental and other matters the company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits although the company maintains insurance to cover some of these types of claims and establishes reserves when appropriate final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may exceed the companys insurance coverage or differ materially from the recorded reserves additionally the company could be impacted by adverse developments not currently reflected in the companys reserve estimates

failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes andor work stoppages 

most of csxs employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements approximately 70 percent of these agreements are bargained for nationally by the national carriers conference committee and negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages under the railway labor acts procedures which include mediation coolingoff periods and the possibility of an intervention by the president of the united states during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted if however csx is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements the employees covered by the railway labor act could strike which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members additionally from time to time the company enters into csxspecific or “local” bargaining agreements which could also be critical to the company 

the unavailability of critical resources could adversely affect the company’s operational efficiency and ability to meet demand   

marketplace conditions for resources like locomotives as well as the availability of qualified personnel particularly engineers and conductors could each have a negative impact on the company’s ability to meet demand for rail service although the company believes that it has adequate personnel for the current business environment unpredictable increases in demand for rail services or extreme weather conditions may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on the company’s operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity in a particular period 

weaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the company’s access to capital 

the company regularly relies on capital markets for the issuance of longterm debt instruments commercial paper and bank financing from time to time instability or disruptions of the capital markets including credit markets or the deterioration of the company’s financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit access and could increase the cost of financing sources a significant deterioration of the company’s financial condition could also reduce credit ratings and could limit or affect its access to external sources of capital and increase the costs of short and longterm debt financing

the company’s properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure locomotives and freight cars and equipment these categories and the geography of the network are described below 

track and infrastructure 

serving 23  states the district of columbia and the canadian provinces of ontario and quebec the csxt rail network serves among other markets new york philadelphia and boston in the northeast and midatlantic the southeast markets of atlanta miami and new orleans and the midwestern markets of st louis memphis and chicago 

csxt’s track structure includes mainline track connecting terminals and yards track within terminals and switching yards sidings used for passing trains track connecting csxts track to customer locations and track that diverts trains from one track to another known as turnouts total track miles which reflect the size of csxt’s network that connects markets customers and western railroads are greater than csxt’s approximately 20500  route miles at december 2018  the breakdown of track miles was as follows 



in addition to its physical track structure the company operates numerous yards and terminals for rail and intermodal service these serve as points of connectivity between the company and its local customers and as sorting facilities where railcars and intermodal containers are received classed for destination and placed onto outbound trains or arrive and are delivered to the customer as part of the transition to scheduled railroading csx converted a number of hump yards to flat switching operations which allows for less intermediate processing and the opportunity to improve transit time the company’s largest yards and terminals based on 2018 volume number of railcars or intermodal containers processed are listed below

network geography 

csxt’s operations are primarily focused on four major transportation networks and corridors which are defined geographically and by commodity flows below 

interstate 90 i90 corridor  – this csxt corridor links chicago and the midwest to metropolitan areas in new york and new england this route also known as the “waterlevel route” has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks referred to as double track these engineering attributes permit the corridor to support highspeed service across intermodal automotive and merchandise commodities this corridor is a primary route for import traffic coming from the far east through western ports moving eastward across the country through chicago and into the population centers in the northeast the i90 corridor is also a critical link between ports in new york new jersey and pennsylvania and consumption markets in the midwest this route carries goods from all three of the company’s major markets – merchandise coal and intermodal 

interstate 95 i95 corridor  – the csxt i95 corridor connects charleston jacksonville miami and many other cities throughout the southeast with the heavily populated midatlantic and northeastern cities of baltimore philadelphia and new york csxt primarily transports food and consumer products as well as metals and chemicals along this line it is the leading rail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of the district of columbia and provides access to major eastern ports 

southeastern corridor  – this critical part of the network runs between csxt’s western gateways of chicago st louis and memphis through the cities of nashville birmingham and atlanta and markets in the southeast the southeastern corridor is the premier rail route connecting these key cities gateways and markets and positions csxt to efficiently handle projected traffic volumes of intermodal automotive and general merchandise traffic the corridor also provides direct rail service between the coal reserves of the southern illinois basin and the demand for coal in the southeast 

coal network   – the csxt coal network connects the coal mining operations in the appalachian mountain region and illinois basin with industrial areas in the southeast northeast and midatlantic as well as many river lake and deep water port facilities the domestic coal market has declined significantly over the past several years and export coal remains subject to a high degree of volatility csxt’s coal network remains well positioned to supply utility markets in both the northeast and southeast and to transport coal shipments for export outside of the us roughly onethird  of the tons of export coal and the majority  of the domestic coal that the company transports is used for generating electricity

prior year adjusted operating results 

management believes that adjusted operating income adjusted operating ratio adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share assuming dilution are important in evaluating the company’s operating performance and for planning and forecasting future business operations and future profitability these nongaap measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating results because they exclude certain significant items that are not considered indicative of future financial trends

adjusted free cash flow excludes the impact of cash payments for restructuring charge adjusted free cash flow before dividends increased   15 billion  yearoveryear to 32 billion  due to higher earnings from operations which includes the impact of a lower income tax rate a decrease in property additions of 295 million  and higher proceeds from property dispositions of 222 million partially offset by 124 million lower cash payments for restructuring charge

operating statistics  estimated 



a the methodology for calculating train velocity and dwell differ from that prescribed by the stb csxt will continue to report train velocity and dwell using the prescribed methodology to the stb on a weekly basis see additional discussion on the companys website 

certain operating statistics are estimated and can continue to be updated as actuals settle 

key performance measures definitions 

train velocity   average train speed between origin and destination in miles per hour does not include locals yard jobs work trains or passenger trains train velocity measures the profiled schedule of trains from departure to arrival and all interim time and train profiles are periodically updated to align with a changing operation 

dwell   average amount of time in hours between car arrival to and departure from the yard 

revenue tonmiles rtms   the movement of one revenueproducing ton of freight over a distance of one mile 

gross tonmiles gtms   the movement of one ton of train weight over one mile gtms are calculated by multiplying total train weight by distance the train moved total train weight is comprised of the weight of the freight cars and their contents 

ontime originations   percent of scheduled road trains that depart the origin yard ontime or ahead of schedule 

ontime arrivals   percent of scheduled road trains that arrive at the destination yard ontime 

fra personal injury frequency index   number of frareportable injuries per 200000 manhours 

fra train accident rate   number of frareportable train accidents per million trainmiles 

the company strives for continuous improvement in safety and service performance through training innovation and investment investment in training and technology also is designed to allow the companys employees to have an additional layer of protection that can detect and avoid many types of human factor incidents safety programs are designed to prevent incidents that can adversely impact employees customers and communities continued capital investment in the companys assets including track bridges signals equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance 

the company’s fra reportable personal injury frequency index of 099 for the full year of 2018 improved 19 versus the prior year as overall injuries fell by 27 outpacing a reduction in manhours the company’s fra train accident frequency rate of 345 for the full year was 12 unfavorable versus the prior year safety performance improved in the second half reflecting the changes made in safety leadership engagement with external resources and the company’s renewed focus on enhancing the overall safety of its employees customers and communities in which the company operates 

operating performance improved significantly throughout the year as train velocity and car dwell achieved record levels in 2018 the operational plan remains focused on delivering further service gains improving transit times and driving asset utilization while controlling costs

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures including those to address regulatory and legislative requirements to have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity its sources and uses of cash balance sheet and external factors should be reviewed 

significant cash flows 

the following charts highlight the components of the change in cash and cash equivalents for operating investing and financing activities for full years 2018 2017 and 2016 

in 2018  the company generated 46 billion  of cash provided by operating activities which was 12 billion  higher than prior year primarily driven by higher cashgenerating income which includes the impact of a lower income tax rate partially offset by lower working capital and other activities in 2017 the company generated 35 billion of cash provided by operating activities which was 431 million higher than 2016 primarily driven by 250 million in voluntary contributions in 2016 to the companys qualified pension plans and higher net earnings in 2017 partially offset by payments related to restructuring activities 

in 2018  net cash used in investing activities was 17 billion  an increase of 189 million  from the prior year primarily driven by an increase in net investment purchases partially offset by lower property additions and higher proceeds from property dispositions in 2017 net cash used in investing activities was 15 billion a decrease of 303 million from 2016 primarily driven by lower property additions 

in 2018 net cash used in financing activities was 25 billion  which represents an increase of 321 million  from the prior year primarily driven by higher share repurchases partially offset by higher net debt issued in 2017 net cash used in financing activities was 22 billion which represented an increase in spending of 911 million from 2016 primarily driven by higher share repurchases and lower net debt issued partially offset by the repayment of sellerfinanced assets in the prior year

sources of cash and liquidity 

the company has multiple sources of liquidity including cash generated from operations and financing sources the company filed a shelf registration statement with the sec in february 2016 which is unlimited as to amount and may be used to issue debt or equity securities at csx’s discretion subject to market conditions and csx board authorization while csx seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit csx to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time or at all in 2018  csx issued a total of 30 billion  of new longterm debt 

csx has access to a 1 billion fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks that expires in may 2020 as of december 31 2018 the company had no outstanding balances under this facility see note 9 debt and credit agreements  for more information the company also has a commercial paper program backed by the revolving credit facility under which the company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of 10 billion outstanding at any one time at december 31 2018 the company had no outstanding debt under the commercial paper program 

uses of cash 

csx uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes which may include working capital requirements repayment of additional indebtedness outstanding from time to time repurchases of csxs common stock capital investments improvements in productivity and other cost reduction initiatives 

in 2018 csx continued to invest in its business to create longterm value for shareholders the company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for longterm profitable growth through optimizing network and terminal capacity funds used for property additions are further described below 



 

planned capital investments for 2019 are expected to be between 16 billion and 17 billion  including approximately 100 million  for ptc of the 2019 investment over half will be used to sustain the core infrastructure the remaining amounts will be allocated to projects supporting service enhancements productivity initiatives and profitable growth csx intends to fund capital investments through cash generated from operations 

csx 2018 form 10k p  40 

csx corporation 

part ii 

the company expects to continue incurring capital costs in connection with the implementation of ptc csx estimates that the total multiyear cost of ptc implementation will be approximately  24 billion  this estimate includes costs for installing the new system along tracks upgrading locomotives adding communication equipment and developing new technologies total ptc spending through 2018 was  22 billion  

csx is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments csx may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors  under item 1a of this form 10k 

the company also uses cash for scheduled payments of debt and leases share repurchases and to pay dividends to shareholders in february 2018 the company announced a 10 percent increase in the quarterly cash dividend to 022 per common share 

material changes in the consolidated balance sheets and working capital 

csxs balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of csxs balanced approach in deploying capital for the benefit of its shareholders which includes investments in infrastructure dividend payments and share repurchases further csx is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint the company ended the year with 11 billion  of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

total assets as well as total liabilities and shareholders equity increased   990 million  from prior year the increase in assets was primarily due to the net increase in cash and shortterm investments of 692 million and higher net properties of 234 million  the increase in cash and shortterm investments was primarily a result of net cash from operations of 46 billion and the issuance of 30 billion in longterm debt partially offset by share repurchases of 47 billion and property additions of 17 billion the increase in total liabilities and shareholders equity combined was driven by the issuance of 30 billion in longterm debt and net earnings of 33 billion partially offset by share repurchases of 47 billion and dividends paid of 751 million 

working capital is considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its shortterm needs csx had a working capital surplus  of 650 million  at december 2018  and 21 million  at december 2017  this increase since the prior year end is primarily the result of an increase in cash due to net cash from operations of 46 billion and the issuance of 30 billion in longterm debt these increases were partially offset by cash used for share repurchases of 47 billion property additions of 17 billion and dividend payments of 751 million 

the company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above although the company currently has a surplus a working capital deficit is not unusual for csx or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity the company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due furthermore csx has sufficient financial capacity including its revolving credit facility commercial paper program and shelf registration statement to manage its daytoday cash requirements and any anticipated obligations the company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity

the cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by csxs longterm credit ratings csxs credit ratings remained stable during 2018  as of december 2018  and december 2017  sps longterm rating on csx was bbb stable and moodys was baa1 stable ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sp and moody’s respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade if csxs credit ratings were to decline to below investment grade levels the company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt in addition a decline in csx’s credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market’s demand and thus the company’s ability to readily issue new debt 

csx is committed to returning cash to shareholders and maintaining an investment grade credit profile capital structure capital investments and cash distributions including dividends and share repurchases are reviewed at least annually by the board of directors

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results may differ from those estimates these estimates and assumptions are discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors on a regular basis significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas 

 

personal injury environmental and legal reserves 

personal injury 

personal injury reserves of 143 million  and 168 million  for 2018  and 2017  respectively represent liabilities for employee workrelated and thirdparty injuries csxt retains an independent actuary to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims the methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims it is based largely on csxts historical claims and settlement experience actual results may vary from estimates due to the number type and severity of the injury costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation for additional details including a description of our related accounting policies see note 5 casualty environmental and other reserves   in the consolidated financial statements

environmental 

environmental reserves were 80 million  and 90 million  in 2018   and 2017  respectively the company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 220  environmentally impaired sites the company reviews its potential liability with respect to each site identified giving consideration to a number of factors such as 

 

conditions that are currently unknown could at any given location result in additional exposure the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated for additional details including a description of our related accounting policies see note 5 casualty environmental and other reserves   in the consolidated financial statements 

legal 

the company is involved in litigation incidental to its business and is a party to a number of legal actions and claims various governmental proceedings and private civil lawsuits the company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate the amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings newly discovered or developed evidence or changes in laws regulations and evidentiary standards an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity in that particular period for additional details including a description of our related accounting policies see note 5 casualty environmental and other reserves   in the consolidated financial statements additionally see item 3 legal proceedings  for further discussion of these items 

pension and postretirement medical plan accounting 

the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried management personnel for employees hired prior to 2003 the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement for employees hired in 2003 or thereafter benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age service and compensation   as of december 2018  the projected benefit obligation for the company’s pension plans was 28 billion  

csx 2018 form 10k p  44 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates  continued 

in addition to these plans the company sponsors a postretirement medical plan and a noncontributory life insurance plan that provide certain benefits to fulltime salaried management employees hired prior to 2003 upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met beginning in 2019 both the life insurance benefit for eligible active employees and health savings account contributions made by the company to eligible retirees younger than 65 will be eliminated beginning in 2020 the employerfunded health reimbursement arrangements for eligible retirees 65 years or older will be eliminated as a result of these plan amendments the company recognized a decrease of 102 million in the postretirement benefit liability as of december 2018  the projected benefit obligation for the company’s other postretirement benefit plans was 118 million  

for information related to the funded status of the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans see note 8 employee benefit plans  

the accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the compensationretirement benefits topic  in the asc this rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following 

 

the company engages independent actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the company determines are appropriate based on historical trends current market rates and future projections these amounts are reviewed by management 

discount rates 

discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the service and interest cost components of pension and postretirement expense discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other postretirement benefits could be effectively settled or in other words how much it would cost the company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the companys expected future benefit payments the company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of yearend for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans expected benefit payments 

the company measures the service and interest cost components of the net pension and postretirement benefits expense by using individual spot rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year instead of a single weightedaverage discount rate approach which was used prior to 2017 under the spot rate approach individual spot discount rates along the same high quality corporate bonds yield curve used to measure the pension and postretirement benefit liabilities are applied to the relevant projected cash flows at the relevant maturity    

csx 2018 form 10k p  45 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates  continued 

the weighted average discount rates used by the company to value its 2018  pension and postretirement obligations are 424 percent  and 398 percent  respectively for 2017  the weighted average discount rates used by the company to value its pension and postretirement obligations were 356 percent  and 334 percent  respectively discount rates may differ for pension and postretirement benefits due to varying duration of the liabilities for projected payments for each plan as of december 2018  the estimated duration of pensions and postretirement benefits is approximately 11  years and 6  years respectively   

each year these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates in general if interest rates decline or rise the assumed discount rates will change 

longterm rate of return on plan assets 

the expected longterm average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation in estimating that rate the company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected longterm rate of return on assets as this assumption is longterm the annual review may result in less frequent adjustment than other assumptions used in pension accounting the longterm rate of return on plan assets used by the company to value its benefit cost for the subsequent plan year was 675 percent  in both 2018  and 2017  

salary scale inflation rates 

salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the company the company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates the company used a salary scale rate of 460 percent  in both 2018  and 2017  to value its pension obligations 

other assumptions 

the calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to health care cost trend rates mortality rates turnover and retirement age these assumptions are based upon historical data recent plan experience and industry trends and are determined by management

2019  estimated pension and postretirement expense 

net periodic pension and postretirement benefits expenses for 2019  are expected to be a credit of 7 million and 2 million respectively net periodic pension and postretirement benefits expenses for 2019 are expected to include service cost expense of 32 million and 1 million respectively service cost expense is included in labor and fringe on the consolidated income statement and all other components of net pension expense and postretirement benefits expense are included in other income  net net periodic pension expense and postretirement benefits expense in 2018 was an 11 million  credit and a 7 million  expense respectively the net increase in the expected credit is primarily due to changes to the postretirement benefits plan partially offset by unfavorable pension plan asset experience 

the following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effects of a one percent change in certain assumptions like discount rates longterm rate of return and salaries on the 2019 estimated pension and postretirement expense 



depreciation policies for assets utilizing the grouplife method 

the depreciable assets of the company are depreciated using either the grouplife or straightline method of accounting which are both acceptable depreciation methods in accordance with gaap the company depreciates its railroad assets including mainline track locomotives and freight cars using the grouplife method of accounting assets depreciated under the grouplife method comprise 87  of total fixed assets of 45 billion  on a gross basis at december 2018  the remaining depreciable assets of the company including nonrailroad assets and assets under capital leases are depreciated using the straightline method on a per asset basis   land is not depreciated 

management performs a review of depreciation expense and useful lives on a regular basis under the grouplife method the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying management’s assumptions regarding the service lives of its properties there are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include 

 

csx 2018 form 10k p  47 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates  continued   

recent experience with depreciation studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes that did not materially affect the company’s annual depreciation expense of 13 billion  for each 2018  2017  and 2016 a one percent  change in the average estimated useful life of all grouplife assets would result in an approximate 12 million  change to the company’s annual depreciation expense for additional details including a more detailed description of our related accounting policies see note 6 properties in the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

csx accounts for income taxes in accordance with the income taxes topic  in the asc that addresses how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under this topic the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the amount recognized in the financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent  likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 

csx files a consolidated federal income tax return which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries examinations of the federal income tax returns of csx have been completed through 2016 during 2018  the company participated in a contemporaneous internal revenue service “irs” audit of tax years 2017 and 2018  management believes an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed while the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty it is the opinion of csx management that none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition results of operations or liquidity of csx an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items however could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year as of december 2018  the company’s uncertain tax positions were 12 million

financial information 

see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for operating revenue operating income and total assets for each of the last three fiscal years 

company history 

a leader in freight rail transportation for more than 190 years the company’s heritage dates back to the early nineteenth century when the baltimore and ohio railroad company “bo” – the nation’s first common carrier – was chartered in 1827 since that time the company has built on this foundation to create a railroad that could safely and reliably service the everincreasing demands of a growing nation 

  

since its founding numerous railroads have combined with the former bo through merger and consolidation to create what has become csx each of the railroads that combined into the csx family brought new geographical reach to valuable markets gateways cities ports and transportation corridors 

  

csx was incorporated in 1978 under virginia law in 1980 the company completed the merger of the chessie system and seaboard coast line industries into csx the merger allowed the company to connect northern population centers and appalachian coal fields to growing southeastern markets later the company’s acquisition of key portions of conrail inc conrail allowed csxt to link the northeast including new england and the new york metropolitan area with chicago and midwestern markets as well as the growing areas in the southeast already served by csxt this current rail network allows the company to directly serve every major market in the eastern united states with safe dependable environmentally responsible and fuel efficient freight transportation and intermodal service 

  

competition 

the business environment in which the company operates is highly competitive shippers typically select transportation providers that offer the most compelling combination of service and price service requirements both in terms of transit time and reliability vary by shipper and commodity as a result the company’s primary competition varies by commodity geographic location and mode of available transportation and includes other railroads motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and to a less significant extent barges ships and pipelines 

  

csxt’s primary rail competitor is norfolk southern railway which operates throughout much of the company’s territory other railroads also operate in parts of the company’s territory depending on the specific market competing railroads and deregulated motor carriers may exert pressure on price and service levels for further discussion on the risk of competition to the company see item 1a risk factors 

regulatory environment 

the companys operations are subject to various federal state provincial canada and local laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses operating in the united states and canada in the us the railroad operations conducted by the companys subsidiaries including csxt are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the surface transportation board “stb” the federal railroad administration “fra” and its sister agency within the us department of transportation dot the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration “phmsa” together fra and phmsa have broad jurisdiction over railroad operating standards and practices including track freight cars locomotives and hazardous materials requirements in addition the us environmental protection agency “epa” has regulatory authority with respect to matters that impact the companys properties and operations the epa is considering regulatory action directed towards the railroad industry governing the disposal of creosote crossties and seeking to increase air emission regulations that may impact our operations or increase costs similarly the transportation security administration “tsa” a component of the department of homeland security has broad authority over railroad operating practices that may have homeland security implications in canada the railroad operations conducted by the company’s subsidiaries including csxt are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the canadian transportation agency

although the staggers act of 1980 significantly deregulated the us rail industry the stb has broad jurisdiction over rail carriers the stb regulates routes fuel surcharges conditions of service rates for nonexempt traffic acquisitions of control over rail common carriers and the transfer extension or abandonment of rail lines among other railroad activities 

positive train control 

in 2008 congress enacted the rail safety improvement act the “rsia” the legislation included a mandate that all class i freight railroads implement an interoperable positive train control system “ptc” by december 31 2015 implementation of a ptc system is designed to prevent traintotrain collisions overspeed derailments incursions into established workzone limits and train diversions onto another set of tracks on october 29 2015 the president of the united states signed the positive train control enforcement and implementation act of 2015 into law extending the deadline this act requires the installation of all ptc hardware be completed by december 31 2018 and assuming certain conditions are met requires that the ptc system be fully operational by december 31 2020

in 2012 the stb announced it would accept comments on a proposal by the national industrial transportation league that would require class i railroads to provide a form of competitive access to customers served solely by one railroad under this proposal csx would be required to allow a competing railroad to access certain customers that are currently solely served by csxs network in early 2013 shippers railroads and other parties submitted comments on the proposal and the stb held a hearing in march 2014 to receive further input from participating parties since the hearing the stb has taken no further action in the proceeding 

in april 2014 the stb announced it would receive comments to explore its methodology for determining railroad revenue adequacy the revenue adequacy standard represents the level of profitability for a healthy carrier shippers railroads and other parties filed comments in late 2014 the stb held a hearing in july 2015 to receive further input from participating parties since the hearing the stb has taken no further action in the proceeding 

csx participated in a public listening session on october 11 2017 at the stb in response to service complaints during the session the company addressed customer concerns and detailed the company’s service recovery plans at that time at the stbs request csx is providing additional operating measures on a weekly basis that are available on the companys website 

new rules regarding among other things competitive access or revenue adequacy could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations and liquidity as well as its ability to invest in enhancing and maintaining vital infrastructure for further discussion on regulatory risks to the company see item 1a risk factors

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the companys forwardlooking statements additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the company or that the company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

new legislation or regulatory changes could impact the companys earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices 

legislation passed by congress new regulations issued by federal agencies or executive orders issued by the president of the united states could significantly affect the revenues costs and profitability of the companys business for instance several of the proposals under consideration by the stb could have a significant negative impact on the companys ability to negotiate prices for the value of rail services provided and meet service standards which could force a reduction in capital spending in addition statutes imposing price constraints or affecting railtorail competition could adversely affect the companys profitability 

  

government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the companys operations and financial results 

the company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies including the stb fra phmsa tsa epa and other state provincial and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic health safety labor environmental tax legal and other matters new or modified rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the companys operating costs or reduce operating efficiencies and impact service performance for example the rsia mandates that the installation of ptc hardware be completed by december 31 2018 and assuming certain conditions are met requires that the ptc system be fully operational by december 31 2020 on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that have commuter or passenger operations although csx remains on track to meet this regulatory requirement noncompliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the company and can subject the company to fines penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions 

the company’s business strategies may not achieve the anticipated objectives 

the implementation of the company’s business strategies could result in operational disruptions loss of existing customers regulatory issues and other adverse consequences if these strategies fail to achieve the anticipated benefits or take longer to implement than expected the company’s operations and financial results may be adversely affected 

failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes andor work stoppages 

most of csxs employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements approximately 70 percent of these agreements are bargained for nationally by the national carriers conference committee and negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages under the railway labor acts procedures which include mediation coolingoff periods and the possibility of an intervention of the us president during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted if however csx is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements or if terms of existing agreements are disputed the employees covered by the railway labor act could strike which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members additionally from time to time the company enters into csxspecific or “local” bargaining agreements which could also be critical to the company and its new business strategies

network constraints could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency 

csxt could experience rail network difficulties related to i increased volume ii locomotive or crew shortages iii extreme weather conditions iv impacts from changes in yard capacity or network structure or composition including train routes v increased passenger activities including highspeed rail or vi regulatory changes impacting where and how fast csxt can transport freight or maintain routes which could have a negative effect on csxts operational fluidity leading to deterioration of service asset utilization and overall efficiency 

global economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight 

a decline or disruption in general domestic and global economic conditions that affects demand for the commodities and products the company transports including import and export volume could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects on the companys cost structure and profitability for example if the rate of economic growth in asia slows european economies contract or if the global supply of seaborne coal or price of seaborne coal changes from its current levels us export coal volume could be adversely impacted resulting in lower revenue for csx additionally changes to trade agreements or policies could result in reduced import and export volumes due to increased tariffs and lower consumer demand if the company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products the company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs workforce adjustments and other related activities which could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

  

changing dynamics in the us and global energy markets could negatively impact profitability 

over the past few years production and source locations of natural gas in the us have also increased dramatically which has resulted in lower natural gas prices in csx’s service territory as a result of sustained low natural gas prices many coalfired power plants have been displaced by natural gasfired power generation facilities if natural gas prices were to remain low additional coalfired plants could be displaced which would likely further reduce the companys domestic coal volumes and revenues additionally crude oil prices combined with increased pipeline activity have resulted in volatility in domestic crude oil production which has adversely affected crude oil volumes for csx 

csxt as a common carrier by rail is required by law to transport hazardous materials which could expose the company to significant costs and claims 

a train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury property or natural resource damage environmental penalties and remediation obligations such claims if insured could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates under federal regulations csxt is required to transport hazardous materials under the legal duty referred to as the common carrier mandate 

csxt is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials in november 2008 the tsa issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail noncompliance with these rules can subject the company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident finally legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances which could increase operating costs reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials

climate change and other emissionsrelated laws and regulations could adversely affect the companys operations and financial results 

climate change and other emissionsrelated laws and regulations have been proposed and in some cases adopted on the federal state provincial and local levels these final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions caps taxes or other controls on emissions in particular the epa has issued various regulations and may issue additional regulations targeting emissions including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles 

any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations could adversely affect the companys operations and financial results by among other things i reducing coalfired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards ii reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the united states and canada iii increasing the companys fuel capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies and iv making it difficult for the companys customers in the us and canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner any of these factors could reduce the amount of shipments the company handles and have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs 

the company is subject to wideranging federal state provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions into the air ground and water the handling storage use generation transportation and disposal of waste and other materials the cleanup of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees if the company violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations csx could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators the company can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which csx is responsible in certain circumstances environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties leased properties adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or company predecessors as well as to properties currently owned leased or used by the company 

the company has been and may in the future be subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated or is strictly liable under environmental laws or regulations and such violations can result in the companys incurring fines penalties or costs relating to the cleanup of environmental contamination although the company believes it has appropriately recorded current and longterm liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing the company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination 

  

the company relies on the security stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business 

the company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business the performance and reliability of the companys technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively a cybersecurity attack which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems or other significant disruption or failure could result in a service interruption train accident misappropriation of confidential information process failure security breach or other operational difficulties such an event could result in decreased revenues and increased capital insurance or operating costs including increased security costs to protect the companys infrastructure insurance maintained by the company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from cyber incidents may not be sufficient to cover all damages a disruption or compromise of the companys information technology systems even for short periods of time could have a material adverse effect

disruption of the supply chain could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs 

the capital intensive nature and sophistication of core rail equipment including rolling stock equipment locomotives rail and ties limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers if any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage csxt could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage in addition a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and as such adverse developments in international relations new trade regulations disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase csxts operating costs additionally if a fuel supply shortage were to arise the company would be negatively impacted 

the company faces competition from other transportation providers 

the company experiences competition in pricing service reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and to a less significant extent barges ships and pipelines other transportation providers generally use public rightsofway that are built and maintained by governmental entities while csxt and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation such as through the use of automation autonomy or electrification or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks could negatively impact the companys competitive position additionally any future consolidation in the rail industry could materially affect the regulatory and competitive environment in which the company operates 

future acts of terrorism war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the companys operations 

terrorist attacks along with any government response to those attacks may adversely affect the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity csxts rail lines other key infrastructure and information technology systems may be targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war this risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues in addition premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the company could increase dramatically or the coverage may no longer be available 

  

furthermore in response to the heightened risk of terrorism federal state and local governmental bodies are proposing and in some cases have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry for example the department of homeland security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials complying with these or future regulations could continue to increase the companys operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies 

severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage 

the companys operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences including floods fires hurricanes and earthquakes as a result the companys rail network may be damaged its workforce may be unavailable fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur in addition the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions insurance maintained by the company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations depending on the nature of the risk insured this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the companys damages or damages to others and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates even with insurance if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service the company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations

the company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures 

as part of its railroad and other operations the company is subject to various claims and lawsuits related to disputes over commercial practices labor and unemployment matters occupational and personal injury claims property damage environmental and other matters the company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits although the company maintains insurance to cover some of these types of claims and establishes reserves when appropriate final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may exceed the companys insurance coverage or differ materially from the recorded reserves additionally the company could be impacted by adverse developments not currently reflected in the companys reserve estimates 

the unavailability of critical resources could adversely affect the company’s operational efficiency and ability to meet demand   

marketplace conditions for resources like locomotives as well as the availability of qualified personnel particularly engineers and conductors could each have a negative impact on the company’s ability to meet demand for rail service although the company believes that it has adequate personnel for the current business environment unpredictable increases in demand for rail services or extreme weather conditions may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on the company’s operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity in a particular period 

weaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the company’s access to capital 

due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient railroad the company regularly relies on capital markets for the issuance of longterm debt instruments as well as on bank financing from time to time instability or disruptions of the capital markets including credit markets or the deterioration of the company’s financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit access and could increase the cost of financing sources a significant deterioration of the company’s financial condition could also reduce credit ratings and could limit or affect its access to external sources of capital and increase the costs of short and longterm debt financing

 item 2 properties 

  

the company’s properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure locomotives and freight cars and equipment these categories and the geography of the network are described below 

track and infrastructure 

serving 23  states the district of columbia and the canadian provinces of ontario and quebec the csxt rail network serves among other markets new york philadelphia and boston in the northeast and midatlantic the southeast markets of atlanta miami and new orleans and the midwestern cities of st louis memphis and chicago 

csxt’s track structure includes mainline track connecting terminals and yards track within terminals and switching yards sidings used for passing trains track connecting csxts track to customer locations and track that diverts trains from one track to another known as turnouts total track miles which reflect the size of csxt’s network that connects markets customers and western railroads are greater than csxt’s approximately 21000  route miles at december 2017  the breakdown of track miles was as follows 



in addition to its physical track structure the company operates numerous yards and terminals for rail and intermodal service these serve as points of connectivity between the company and its local customers and as sorting facilities where railcars and intermodal containers are received classed for destination and placed onto outbound trains or arrive and are delivered to the customer in 2017 csx converted a number of hump yards to flat switching operations which allows for less intermediate processing and the opportunity to improve transit time the company’s largest yards and terminals based on 2017 volume number of railcars or intermodal containers processed are listed below

network geography 

csxt’s operations are primarily focused on four major transportation networks and corridors which are defined geographically and by commodity flows below 

interstate 90 i90 corridor  – this csxt corridor links chicago and the midwest to metropolitan areas in new york and new england this route also known as the “waterlevel route” has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks referred to as double track these engineering attributes permit the corridor to support highspeed service across intermodal automotive and merchandise commodities this corridor is a primary route for import traffic coming from the far east through western ports moving eastward across the country through chicago and into the population centers in the northeast the i90 corridor is also a critical link between ports in new york new jersey and pennsylvania and consumption markets in the midwest this route carries goods from all three of the company’s major markets – merchandise coal and intermodal 

interstate 95 i95 corridor  – the csxt i95 corridor connects charleston jacksonville miami and many other cities throughout the southeast with the heavily populated midatlantic and northeastern cities of baltimore philadelphia and new york csxt primarily transports food and consumer products as well as metals and chemicals along this line it is the leading rail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of the district of columbia and provides access to major eastern ports 

southeastern corridor  – this critical part of the network runs between csxt’s western gateways of chicago st louis and memphis through the cities of nashville birmingham and atlanta and markets in the southeast the southeastern corridor is the premier rail route connecting these key cities gateways and markets and positions csxt to efficiently handle projected traffic volumes of intermodal automotive and general merchandise traffic the corridor also provides direct rail service between the coal reserves of the southern illinois basin and the demand for coal in the southeast 

coal network   – the csxt coal network connects the coal mining operations in the appalachian mountain region and illinois basin with industrial areas in the southeast northeast and midatlantic as well as many river lake and deep water port facilities the domestic coal market has declined significantly over the past several years and export coal remains subject to a high degree of volatility csxt’s coal network remains well positioned to supply utility markets in both the northeast and southeast and to transport coal shipments for export outside of the us roughly onethird  of the tons of export coal and the majority  of the domestic coal that the company transports is used for generating electricity

revenue 

in 2017 revenue increased   339 million  when compared to the previous year primarily due to gains in export coal price increases across nearly all other markets and fuel recovery partially offset by the 178 million impact of an extra fiscal week in 2016 and lower merchandise volumes revenue per unit increased over prior year as pricing gains and higher fuel recoveries were partially offset by unfavorable mix 

merchandise 

chemicals   volume declined primarily due to sustained challenges in the eastern crudebyrail market this decline offset an increase in shipments of frac sand and petroleum gases due to growth in drilling activity 

automotive   volume declined as north american vehicle production fell 

agricultural and food products    volume declined due to challenges in the export market as well as a large southeastern grain crop leading to local truck sourcing to feed mills 

minerals   volume slightly declined as shortterm competitive losses were mostly offset by growth in construction project activity 

fertilizers   volume declined primarily driven by the closure of a customer facility as well as hurricane irma’s impact on central florida phosphate operations 

forest products   volume declined as the decrease in shipments of paper products as a result of mill closures and truck competition was partially offset by strong pulp board volumes driven by ecommerce demand 

metals and equipment   volume slightly declined as a nonrecurring 2016 benefit from large pipe projects was partially offset by increases in equipment moves 

coal 

domestic   utility coal volume declined 12 percent as the competitive loss of shorthaul interchange traffic more than offset underlying growth at other utilities coke iron ore and other volume declined 13 percent primarily in iron ore shipments as a large customer temporarily halted its production 

export     volume increased 42 percent as global supply levels and pricing conditions supported strong growth in us coal exports 

intermodal 

domestic   volume declined 2 percent as rationalization of lowdensity lanes and competitive losses more than offset growth with existing customers 

international   volume was up 7 percent driven by competitive gains and strong performance with existing customers as eastern port volumes increased  

other 

other revenue increased 66 million versus prior year primarily due to a 58 million settlement in 2017 related to a customer that did not meet historical volume commitments and higher incidental charges

other income expense  net  includes investment gains and losses certain nonoperating equity earnings or losses and other nonoperating activities other income decreased   25 million  to 21 million  primarily due to the reclassification of real estate activities from other nonoperating to operating income in 2017 

income tax benefit expense   decreased   34 billion  from an expense of 10 billion in 2016 to a benefit of 23 billion  in 2017 primarily due to a 35 billion noncash reduction in income tax mostly resulting from the revaluation of the companys net deferred tax liabilities to reflect the recently enacted 21 percent federal corporate tax rate this reduction was partially offset by additional income tax expense resulting from increased earnings before income taxes 

net earnings   increased   38 billion  to 55 billion  and earnings per diluted share increased   418  to 599  due to the factors mentioned above including the significant impact of tax reform lower average shares outstanding resulting from higher share repurchase activity had a positive impact on earnings per diluted share

revenue 

in 2016 revenue decreased 742 million or six percent due to a five percent decline in volume including the 178 million positive impact of an extra week of volume and a significant decline in fuel recoveries partially offset by increased pricing 

merchandise 

chemicals   volume declined as energy market headwinds significantly reduced crude oil and frac sand shipments this reduction was partially offset by the ramp up of a fly ash remediation project and a modest increase in core chemical markets 

automotive   volume increased as a result of strong north american light vehicle production and growth across several customers additionally movement of trucks and suvs continued to outpace passenger cars consistent with customer buying patterns 

agricultural and food products   volume declined as the strong us dollar continued to support import grain and a robust southeastern crop spurred additional local truck sourcing displacing grain shipments by rail additionally ethanol market dynamics shifted to favor the gulf region for storage and export precluding csx from participation in shipments from western origins to the gulf 

minerals   volume was up slightly due to strong gains in aggregates which include crushed stone sand and gravel particularly for highway and nonresidential construction in southern markets the growth was partially offset by headwinds in salt and lime reflecting mild winter weather and steel production challenges respectively 

fertilizers   volume was flat as the strong us dollar which drove high levels of imported sulfur displaced rail transport and nitrogen demand fell in anticipation of further commodity price deterioration this offset growth in phosphate rock driven by operational efficiency that allowed for additional rail traffic conversion that would otherwise move by truck  

forest products   volume declined as headwinds from electronic substitution and reduced paper products demand drove industry consolidation that reduced rail volume further excess truck capacity in 2016 captured some volume that traditionally moved by rail 

metals and equipment   volume was down as the strong us dollar allowed for continued high levels of steel imports which led to reduced domestic steel production mill closures and the loss of associated rail moves these declines were partially offset by strength in the windenergy and power generation markets 

coal 

domestic   volume declined 23 percent as mild winter weather in the beginning of the year and low natural gas prices reduced utility coal burn rates and resulted in inflated coal stockpiles   further the weak domestic integrated steel market drove volume decreases in coke 

export   volume was down 15 percent in both metallurgical and thermal coal as a result of the strong us dollar and global oversupply which impacted us competitiveness in the world market particularly in the first half of the year

intermodal 

domestic   volume increased 4 percent as secular growth and new service offerings were partially offset by excess truck capacity headwinds and a shorthaul competitive loss 

international   volume declined 9 percent as headwinds from competitive losses more than offset moderate growth across other customers 

other 

other revenue decreased 110 million versus prior year primarily due to payments received in 2015 from customers that did not meet volume commitments further decreases in incidental revenue as well as lower coal revenue from affiliates were partially offset by adjustments to revenue reserves

nongaap measures  unaudited 

csx reports its financial results in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap csx also uses certain nongaap measures that fall within the meaning of securities and exchange commission regulation g and regulation sk item 10e which may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparison to prior reported results nongaap measures do not have standardized definitions and are not defined by gaap therefore csx’s nongaap measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies the presentation of these nongaap measures should not be considered in isolation from as a substitute for or as superior to the financial information presented in accordance with gaap reconciliations of nongaap measures to corresponding gaap measures are below 

adjusted operating results 

management believes that adjusted operating income adjusted operating ratio adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share assuming dilution are important in evaluating the company’s operating performance and for planning and forecasting future business operations and future profitability these nongaap measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating results because they exclude certain significant items that are not considered indicative of future financial trends 

the restructuring charge of 325 million  was tax effected using rates reflective of the applicable tax amounts for each component of the charge the 36 billion benefit to net earnings resulting from tax reform was comprised of a 35 billion aftertax reduction to income tax expense and a 142 million pretax benefit in operating income from equity earnings of affiliates partially offset by 1 million pretax of additional expense from minority interests

adjusted free cash flow 

free cash flow is considered a nongaap financial measure under sec regulation g   and regulation sk item 10e  management believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as it is important in evaluating the company’s financial performance more specifically free cash flow measures cash generated by the business after reinvestment this measure represents cash available for both equity and bond investors to be used for dividends share repurchases or principal reduction on outstanding debt free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than a substitute for cash provided by operating activities free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and certain other investing activities free cash flow before dividends increased   854 million  yearoveryear to 17 billion  the increase in free cash flow from the prior year is primarily due to lower property additions of 358 million  voluntary contributions to the companys qualified pension plans of 250 million  in 2016 and higher earnings from operations adjusted free cash flow excludes the impact cash payments of 135 million for restructuring charge 

  

the following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities gaap measure to free cash flow nongaap measure

operating statistics  estimated 



a the methodology for calculating train velocity and dwell differ from that prescribed by the stb csx will continue to report train velocity and dwell using the prescribed methodology to the stb on a weekly basis 

certain operating statistics are estimated and can continue to be updated as actuals settle 

key performance measures definitions 

fra personal injury frequency index   number of frareportable injuries per 200000 manhours 

fra train accident rate   number of frareportable train accidents per million trainmiles 

train velocity   average train speed between origin and destination in miles per hour does not include locals yard jobs work trains or passenger trains 

dwell   average amount of time in hours between car arrival to and departure from the yard 

ontime originations   percent of scheduled road trains that depart the origin yard ontime or ahead of schedule 

ontime arrivals   percent of scheduled road trains that arrive at the destination yard ontime 

the company measures and reports safety and service performance the company strives for continuous improvement in these measures through training innovation and investment investment in training and technology also is designed to allow csx employees to have an additional layer of protection that can detect and avoid many types of human factor incidents the companys safety programs are designed to prevent incidents that can adversely impact employees customers and communities continued capital investment in the companys assets including track bridges signals equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance 

csx’s fra reportable personal injury frequency index of 119 for the full year of 2017 was 13 percent unfavorable versus the prior year as manhours fell by nine percent while overall injuries were up slightly while the fra train accident frequency rate increased yearoveryear overall fra train accidents remained flat and train miles decreased 12 percent yearoveryear csx remains committed to ongoing safety improvement with a focus on reducing injury severity and avoiding catastrophic events 

in order to more accurately represent the company’s operating performance csx revised the way it calculates train velocity and terminal dwell effective third quarter 2017 these revisions are consistent with the principles of scheduled railroading updated definitions for each key performance measure are included beneath the operating statistics table prior periods have been restated to conform to the current methodology details of the changes are as follows

these revisions differ from the methodology prescribed by the surface transportation board stb for reporting train velocity and dwell csx will continue to report train velocity and dwell to the stb on a weekly basis using the prescribed methodology at the stbs request csx is providing additional operating measures on a weekly basis that are available on the companys website 

csx’s operating performance improved versus the prior year in certain categories as network fluidity challenges in the third quarter of 2017 were offset by substantial improvement from the implementation of scheduled railroading and a balanced train plan going forward csx remains focused on executing the operational plan to deliver further service gains improve transit times and drive asset utilization while controlling costs 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures including those to address regulatory and legislative requirements to have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity its balance sheet sources and uses of cash flow and external factors should be reviewed 

material changes in the consolidated balance sheets and significant cash flows 

consolidated balance sheets 

csxs balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of csxs balanced approach in deploying capital for the benefit of its shareholders which includes investments in infrastructure dividend payments and share repurchases 

total assets as well as total liabilities and shareholders equity increased   325 million  from prior year the increase in assets was driven by higher net properties of 614 million  resulting from capital investment and an increase in affiliates and other companies of 160 million primarily resulting from the benefits of recent tax reform these increases were partially offset by a decrease in cash and shortterm investments of 601 million the increase in total liabilities and shareholders equity combined was driven by net earnings of 55 billion partially offset by the decrease in deferred income taxes of 32 billion as a result of recent tax reform and share repurchases of 20 billion

sources of cash 

the company has multiple sources of cash first the company generates cash from operations in 2017  the company generated 35 billion  of cash provided by operating activities which was 431 million  higher than prior year primarily driven by 250 million in voluntary contributions in 2016 to the companys qualified pension plans and higher net earnings partially offset by payments related to restructuring activities in 2016 the company generated 30 billion of cash provided by operating activities which was 329 million lower than 2015 primarily driven by 250 million in voluntary contributions to the companys qualified pension plans 

  

second csx has access to numerous financing sources including a 1 billion fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in may 2020 as of the date of this filing the company has no outstanding balances under this facility see note 9 debt and credit agreements  for more information 

third csx filed a new shelf registration statement with the sec in february 2016 which is unlimited as to amount and may be used to issue debt or equity securities at csx’s discretion subject to market conditions and csx board authorization while csx seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit csx to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time or at all 

uses of cash 

csx continued to invest in its business to create longterm value for shareholders in 2017  net cash used in investing activities was 15 billion  a decrease of 303 million  from the prior year primarily driven by lower property additions in 2016 net cash used in investing activities was 18 billion a decrease of 11 billion from 2015 primarily driven by lower net purchases of shortterm investments and lower property additions 

the company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for longterm profitable growth through optimizing network and terminal capacity funds used for property additions are further described below

planned capital investments for 2018 are expected to be 16 billion  including about 200 million  for ptc of the 2018 investment the majority will be used to sustain the core infrastructure the remaining amounts will be allocated to projects supporting productivity initiatives service enhancements and profitable growth csx intends to fund capital investments through cash generated from operations 

the company expects to continue incurring significant capital costs in connection with the implementation of ptc csx estimates that the total multiyear cost of ptc implementation will be approximately  24 billion  this estimate includes costs for installing the new system along tracks upgrading locomotives adding communication equipment and developing new technologies total ptc spending through 2017 was  20 billion  

in addition to capital investments the company uses cash for scheduled payments of debt and leases share repurchases and to pay dividends to shareholders in april 2017 the company announced an 11 percent increase in the quarterly cash dividend to 020 per common share in 2017 net cash used in financing activities was 22 billion  which represents an increase in spending of 911 million  from the prior year primarily driven by higher share repurchases and lower net debt issued partially offset by the repayment of sellerfinanced assets in the prior year in 2016 net cash used in financing activities was 13 billion which represents an increase in spending of 749 million from 2015 primarily driven by the repayment of sellerfinanced assets higher share repurchases and lower net debt issued 

csx is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments csx may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors  under item 1a of this form 10k 

liquidity and working capital 

currently csx is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint the company ended the year with 419 million  of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments csx has a 1 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks this facility expires in may 2020 and as of the date of this filing the company has no outstanding balances under this facility additionally in 2017  csx issued a total of 850 million  of new longterm debt csx uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes which may include repayment of additional indebtedness outstanding from time to time repurchases of csxs common stock capital investments working capital requirements and improvements in productivity and other cost reduction initiatives see note 9 debt and credit agreements 

with the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act the act on december 22 2017 the federal corporate income tax rate was reduced from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 beginning in 2018 csx expects its effective federal and state income tax rate to be approximately 25 

the company has a receivables securitization facility with a three year term scheduled to expire in september 2019  the purpose of this facility is to provide an alternative to commercial paper and a low cost source of shortterm liquidity of up to 200 million  depending on eligible receivables balances under the terms of this facility csxt transfers eligible thirdparty receivables to csx trade receivables a bankruptcyremote special purpose subsidiary a separate subsidiary of csx services the receivables upon transfer the receivables become assets of csx trade receivables and are not available to the creditors of csx or any of its other subsidiaries in the event csx trade receivables draws under this facility the company will record an equivalent amount of debt on its consolidated financial statements as of the date of this filing the company has no outstanding balances under this facility 

csx 2017 form 10k p  43 

csx corporation 

part ii 

working capital can also be considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its shortterm needs csx had a working capital surplus  of 21 million  at december 2017  and 447 million  at december 2016  this decrease since year end is primarily due to shares repurchases of 20 billion cash paid for property additions of 20 billion and dividends paid of 708 million these working capital decreases were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of 35 billion and new debt issued of 850 million 

the company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above although the company currently has a surplus a working capital deficit is not unusual for csx or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity the company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due furthermore csx has sufficient financial capacity including its revolving credit facility trade receivable facility and shelf registration statement to manage its daytoday cash requirements and any anticipated obligations the company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity csx is currently reviewing its cash deployment strategy with respect to capital structure and shareholder distributions 

credit ratings 

credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” and moody’s investors service “moody’s” use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa for sp and moody’s respectively a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 

  

the cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by csxs longterm credit ratings csxs credit ratings remained stable during 2017  as of december 2017  and december 2016  sps longterm rating on csx was bbb stable and moodys was baa1 stable ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sp and moody’s respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade the company is committed to maintaining an investment grade credit rating if csxs credit ratings were to decline to below investment grade levels the company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt in addition a decline in csx’s credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market’s demand and thus the company’s ability to readily issue new debt

in addition to these plans the company sponsors a postretirement medical plan and a life insurance plan that provide certain benefits to fulltime salaried management employees hired prior to 2003 upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met eligible retirees who are age 65 years or older medicareeligible are covered by a health reimbursement arrangement which is an employerfunded account that can be used for reimbursement of eligible medical expenses eligible retirees younger than 65 years nonmedicare eligible are covered by a selfinsured program partially funded by participating retirees the life insurance plan is noncontributory as of december 2017  the projected benefit obligation for the company’s other postretirement benefit plans was 250 million  

for information related to the funded status of the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans see note 8 employee benefit plans  

the accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the compensationretirement benefits topic  in the asc this rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following 

 

the company engages independent actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the company determines are appropriate based on historical trends current market rates and future projections these amounts are reviewed by management

discount rates 

discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the service and interest cost components of pension and postretirement expense discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other postretirement benefits could be effectively settled or in other words how much it would cost the company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the companys expected future benefit payments the company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of yearend for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans expected benefit payments 

beginning in 2017 the company measures the service and interest cost components of the net pension and postretirement benefits expense by using individual spot rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year instead of a single weightedaverage discount rate approach which was used in prior years the company made this change to improve the correlation between projected pension and postretirement benefit liability cash flows and the corresponding spot discount rates and to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs under the spot rate approach individual spot discount rates along the same high quality corporate bonds yield curve used to measure the pension and postretirement benefit liabilities are applied to the relevant projected cash flows at the relevant maturity   the calculated pension and postretirement benefits liabilities are consistent under both the traditional and spot rate approaches the company accounted for this change on a prospective basis as a change in accounting estimate  

the weighted average discount rates used by the company to value its 2017  pension and postretirement obligations are 356 percent  and 334 percent  respectively for 2016  the weighted average discount rates used by the company to value its pension and postretirement obligations were 408 percent  and 371 percent  respectively discount rates may differ for pension and postretirement benefits due to varying duration of the liabilities for projected payments for each plan as of december 2017  the estimated duration of pensions and postretirement benefits is approximately 12  years and seven  years respectively   

each year these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates in general if interest rates decline or rise the assumed discount rates will change 

longterm rate of return on plan assets 

the expected longterm average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation in estimating that rate the company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected longterm rate of return on assets as this assumption is longterm the annual review may result in less frequent adjustment than other assumptions used in pension accounting the longterm rate of return on plan assets used by the company to value its benefit cost for the subsequent plan year was 675 percent  in both 2017  and 2016

salary scale inflation rates 

salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the company the company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates the company used a salary scale rate of 460 percent  in both 2017  and 2016  to value its pension obligations 

other assumptions 

the calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to health care cost trend rates mortality rates turnover and retirement age these assumptions are based upon historical data recent plan experience and industry trends and are determined by management 

2018  estimated pension and postretirement expense 

net pension expense and postretirement benefits expense for 2018  are expected to be a 7 million benefit and an 8 million expense respectively net pension costs for 2018 are expected to be a 7 million benefit and include service cost expense of 35 million postretirement benefits costs for 2018 are expected to be an 8 million expense and include service cost expense of 2 million service cost expense will be included in labor and fringe on the consolidated income statement net periodic pension expense and postretirement benefits expense in 2017 was a 2 million  benefit and a 9 million  expense respectively the decrease in expense is primarily due to favorable pension asset experience slightly offset by the decrease in discount rates 

the following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effects of a one percent change in certain assumptions like discount rates longterm rate of return and salaries on the 2018  estimated pension and postretirement expense 



depreciation policies for assets utilizing the grouplife method 

the depreciable assets of the company are depreciated using either the grouplife or straightline method of accounting which are both acceptable depreciation methods in accordance with gaap the company depreciates its railroad assets including mainline track locomotives and freight cars using the grouplife method of accounting assets depreciated under the grouplife method comprise 86  of total fixed assets of 44 billion  on a gross basis at december 2017  the remaining depreciable assets of the company including nonrailroad assets and assets under capital leases are depreciated using the straightline method on a per asset basis   land is not depreciated

critical accounting estimates  continued   

management performs a review of depreciation expense and useful lives on a regular basis under the grouplife method the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying management’s assumptions regarding the service lives of its properties there are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include 

 

recent experience with depreciation studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes that did not materially affect the company’s annual depreciation expense of 13 billion  13 billion  and 12 billion  for 2017  2016  and 2015 respectively a one percent  change in the average life of all grouplife assets would result in an approximate 12 million  change to the company’s annual depreciation expense for additional details including a more detailed description of our related accounting policies see note 6 properties in the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

csx accounts for income taxes in accordance with the income taxes topic  in the asc that addresses how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under this topic the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the amount recognized in the financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent  likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 

csx files a consolidated federal income tax return which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries examinations of the federal income tax returns of csx have been completed through 2015 during 2017  the company participated in a contemporaneous internal revenue service “irs” audit of tax years 2016 and 2017  management believes an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed while the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty it is the opinion of csx management that none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition results of operations or liquidity of csx an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items however could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year as of december 2017  the company’s uncertain tax positions were 24 million

company history 

a leader in freight rail transportation for nearly 190 years the company’s heritage dates back to the early nineteenth century when the baltimore and ohio railroad company “bo” – the nation’s first common carrier – was chartered in 1827 since that time the company has built on this foundation to create a railroad that could safely and reliably service the everincreasing demands of a growing nation 

  

since its founding numerous railroads have combined with the former bo through merger and consolidation to create what has become csx each of the railroads that combined into the csx family brought new geographical reach to valuable markets gateways cities ports and transportation corridors 

  

csx was incorporated in 1978 under virginia law in 1980 the company completed the merger of the chessie system and seaboard coast line industries into csx the merger allowed the company to connect northern population centers and appalachian coal fields to growing southeastern markets later the company’s acquisition of key portions of conrail inc conrail allowed csxt to link the northeast including new england and the new york metropolitan area with chicago and midwestern markets as well as the growing areas in the southeast already served by csxt this current rail network allows the company to directly serve every major market in the eastern united states with safe dependable environmentally responsible and fuel efficient freight transportation and intermodal service 

  

competition 

the business environment in which the company operates is highly competitive shippers typically select transportation providers that offer the most compelling combination of service and price service requirements both in terms of transit time and reliability vary by shipper and commodity as a result the company’s primary competition varies by commodity geographic location and mode of available transportation and includes other railroads motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and to a less significant extent barges ships and pipelines 

  

csxt’s primary rail competitor is norfolk southern railway which operates throughout much of the company’s territory other railroads also operate in parts of the company’s territory depending on the specific market competing railroads and deregulated motor carriers may exert pressure on price and service levels for further discussion on the risk of competition to the company see item 1a risk factors

regulatory environment 

the companys operations are subject to various federal state provincial canada and local laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses operating in the united states and canada in the us the railroad operations conducted by the companys subsidiaries including csxt are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the surface transportation board “stb” the federal railroad administration “fra” and its sister agency within the us department of transportation dot the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration “phmsa” together fra and phmsa have broad jurisdiction over railroad operating standards and practices including track freight cars locomotives and hazardous materials requirements in addition the us environmental protection agency “epa” has regulatory authority with respect to matters that impact the companys properties and operations the epa is considering regulatory action directed towards the railroad industry governing the disposal of creosote crossties and seeking to increase air emission regulations that may impact our operations or increase costs similarly the transportation security administration “tsa” a component of the department of homeland security has broad authority over railroad operating practices that may have homeland security implications in canada the railroad operations conducted by the company’s subsidiaries including csxt are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the canadian transportation agency 

    

although the staggers act of 1980 significantly deregulated the us rail industry the stb has broad jurisdiction over rail carriers the stb regulates routes fuel surcharges conditions of service rates for nonexempt traffic acquisitions of control over rail common carriers and the transfer extension or abandonment of rail lines among other railroad activities 

positive train control 

in 2008 congress enacted the rail safety improvement act the “rsia” the legislation included a mandate that all class i freight railroads implement an interoperable positive train control system “ptc” by december 31 2015 implementation of a ptc system is designed to prevent traintotrain collisions overspeed derailments incursions into established workzone limits and train diversions onto another set of tracks on october 29 2015 the president of the united states signed the positive train control enforcement and implementation act of 2015 into law extending the deadline this act requires the installation of all ptc hardware be completed by december 31 2018 and assuming certain conditions are met requires that the ptc system be fully operational by december 31 2020 

ptc must be installed on all main lines with passenger and commuter operations as well as most of those over which toxicbyinhalation hazardous materials are transported the company expects to incur significant capital costs in connection with the implementation of ptc as well as related ongoing operating expenses csx currently estimates that the total multiyear cost of ptc implementation will be approximately 24 billion  for the company total ptc investment through 2016  was  18 billion  

  

stb proceedings 

in 2012 the stb announced it would accept comments on a proposal by the national industrial transportation league that would require class i railroads to provide a form of competitive access to customers served solely by one railroad under this proposal csx would be required to allow a competing railroad to access certain customers that are currently solely served by csxs network in early 2013 shippers railroads and other parties submitted comments on the proposal and the stb held a hearing in march 2014 to receive further input from participating parties since the hearing the stb has taken no further action in the proceeding

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the companys forwardlooking statements additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the company or that the company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

new legislation or regulatory changes could impact the companys earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices 

legislation passed by congress new regulations issued by federal agencies or executive orders issued by the president of the united states could significantly affect the revenues costs and profitability of the companys business for instance several of the proposals under consideration by the stb could have a significant negative impact on the companys ability to negotiate prices for the value of rail services provided and meet service standards which could force a reduction in capital spending in addition statutes imposing price constraints or affecting railtorail competition could adversely affect the companys profitability 

  

government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the companys operations and financial results 

the company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies including the stb fra phmsa tsa epa and other state provincial and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic health safety labor environmental tax legal and other matters new or modified rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the companys operating costs or reduce operating efficiencies and impact service performance for example the rsia mandates that the installation of ptc hardware be completed by december 31 2018 and assuming certain conditions are met requires that the ptc system be fully operational by december 31 2020 on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that have commuter or passenger operations noncompliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the company and can subject the company to fines penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions 

failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes andor work stoppages 

most of csxs employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements most of these agreements are bargained for nationally by the national carriers conference committee and negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages under the railway labor acts procedures which include mediation coolingoff periods and the possibility of an intervention of the us president during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted if however csx is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements or if terms of existing agreements are disputed the employees covered by the railway labor act could strike which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members 

  

capacity constraints could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency 

csxt may experience rail network difficulties related to i increased volume ii locomotive or crew shortages iii extreme weather conditions iv increased passenger activities including highspeed rail or v regulatory changes impacting where and how fast   csxt can transport freight or maintain routes which could have a negative effect on csxts operational fluidity leading to deterioration of service asset utilization and overall efficiency 

csx 2016 form 10k p  7 

csx corporation 

part i 

global economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight 

a decline or disruption in general domestic and global economic conditions that affects demand for the commodities and products the company transports including import and export volume could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects on the companys cost structure and profitability for example if the rate of economic growth in asia slows or if european economies contract us export coal volume could be adversely impacted resulting in lower revenue for csx if the company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products the company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs associated with the storage of locomotives railcars and other equipment workforce adjustments and other related activities which could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

  

changing dynamics in the us and global energy markets could negatively impact profitability 

over the past few years production of natural gas in the us has also increased dramatically which has resulted in lower natural gas prices as a result of sustained low natural gas prices many coalfired power plants have been displaced by natural gasfired power generation facilities if natural gas prices were to remain low additional coalfired plants could be displaced which would likely further reduce the companys domestic coal volumes and revenues 

  

additionally depressed crude oil prices due to increased supply or lower demand could result in a further decrease in domestic crude oil production which could have an adverse effect on crude oil volumes for csx in addition new regulations related to the shipment of crude oil by rail including proposed rail car safety standards could increase costs for csx negatively impact network fluidity or have an adverse impact on customers 

csxt as a common carrier by rail is required by law to transport hazardous materials which could expose the company to significant costs and claims 

a train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury property or natural resource damage environmental penalties and remediation obligations such claims if insured could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates under federal regulations csxt is required to transport hazardous materials under the legal duty referred to as the common carrier mandate 

csxt is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials in november 2008 the tsa issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail noncompliance with these rules can subject the company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident finally legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances which could increase operating costs reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials 

climate change and other emissionsrelated laws and regulations could adversely affect the companys operations and financial results 

climate change and other emissionsrelated laws and regulations have been proposed and in some cases adopted on the federal state provincial and local levels these final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions caps taxes or other controls on emissions in particular the epa has issued various regulations and may issue additional regulations targeting emissions including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles

any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations could adversely affect the companys operations and financial results by among other things i reducing coalfired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards ii reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the united states and canada iii increasing the companys fuel capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies and iv making it difficult for the companys customers in the us and canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner any of these factors could reduce the amount of shipments the company handles and have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs 

the company is subject to wideranging federal state provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions into the air ground and water the handling storage use generation transportation and disposal of waste and other materials the cleanup of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees if the company violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations csx could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators the company can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which csx is responsible in certain circumstances environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties leased properties adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or company predecessors as well as to properties currently owned leased or used by the company 

the company has been and may in the future be subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated or is strictly liable under environmental laws or regulations and such violations can result in the companys incurring fines penalties or costs relating to the cleanup of environmental contamination although the company believes it has appropriately recorded current and longterm liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing the company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination 

  

the company relies on the security stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business 

the company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business the performance and reliability of the companys technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively    a cybersecurity attack which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems or other significant disruption or failure could result in a service interruption train accident misappropriation of confidential information process failure security breach or other operational difficulties such an event could result in increased capital insurance or operating costs including increased security costs to protect the companys infrastructure a disruption or compromise of the companys information technology systems even for short periods of time could have a material adverse effect on the company 

disruption of the supply chain could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs 

the capital intensive nature and sophistication of core rail equipment including rolling stock equipment locomotives rail and ties limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers if any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage csxt could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage in addition a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and as such adverse developments in international relations new trade regulations disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase csxts operating costs additionally if a fuel supply shortage were to arise whether due to production restrictions lower refinery outputs a disruption of oil imports adverse political developments or otherwise the company would be negatively impacted

the company faces competition from other transportation providers 

the company experiences competition in pricing service reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and to a less significant extent barges ships and pipelines other transportation providers generally use public rightsofway that are built and maintained by governmental entities while csxt and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks could negatively impact the companys competitive position additionally any future consolidation in the rail industry could materially affect the regulatory and competitive environment in which the company operates 

future acts of terrorism war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the companys operations 

terrorist attacks along with any government response to those attacks may adversely affect the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity csxts rail lines other key infrastructure and information technology systems may be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war this risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues in addition premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the company could increase dramatically or the coverage may no longer be available 

  

furthermore in response to the heightened risk of terrorism federal state and local governmental bodies are proposing and in some cases have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry for example the department of homeland security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials complying with these or future regulations could continue to increase the companys operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies 

severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage 

the companys operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences including floods fires hurricanes and earthquakes as a result the companys rail network may be damaged its workforce may be unavailable fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur in addition the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions insurance maintained by the company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations depending on the nature of the risk insured this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the companys damages or damages to others and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates even with insurance if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service the company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations 

the company could be adversely impacted by actions of activist stockholders and such activism could impact the value of the company’s securities 

while the company continually engages with shareholders and considers their views on business and strategy responding to activist shareholders can be costly and timeconsuming disrupt operations and divert the attention of management and employees the uncertainties associated with such activities could interfere with the company’s ability to effectively execute its strategic plan impact customer retention and longterm growth and limit the companys ability to hire and retain personnel in addition a proxy contest for the election of directors could require the company to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses and require significant time and attention by management and the board of directors uncertainties related to or the results of such activism could affect the market price and volatility of the companys securities

the company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures 

as part of its railroad and other operations the company is subject to various claims and lawsuits related to disputes over commercial practices labor and unemployment matters occupational and personal injury claims property damage environmental and other matters the company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits although the company maintains insurance to cover some of these types of claims and establishes reserves when appropriate final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may exceed the companys insurance coverage or differ materially from the recorded reserves additionally the company is subject to adverse developments not currently reflected in the companys reserve estimates 

the unavailability of critical resources could adversely affect the company’s operational efficiency and ability to meet demand   

marketplace conditions for resources like locomotives as well as the availability of qualified personnel particularly engineers and trainmen could each have a negative impact on the company’s ability to meet demand for rail service although the company believes that it has adequate personnel for the current business environment unpredictable increases in demand for rail services or extreme weather conditions may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on the company’s operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity in a particular period 

weaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the company’s access to capital 

due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient railroad the company regularly relies on capital markets for the issuance of longterm debt instruments as well as on bank financing from time to time instability or disruptions of the capital markets including credit markets or the deterioration of the company’s financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit access and could increase the cost of financing sources a significant deterioration of the company’s financial condition could also reduce credit ratings and could limit or affect its access to external sources of capital and increase the costs of short and longterm debt financing

 item 2 properties 

  

the company’s properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure locomotives and freight cars and equipment these categories and the geography of the network are described below 

track and infrastructure 

serving 23  states the district of columbia and the canadian provinces of ontario and quebec the csxt rail network serves among other markets new york philadelphia and boston in the northeast and midatlantic the southeast markets of atlanta miami and new orleans and the midwestern cities of st louis memphis and chicago 

csxt’s track structure includes main thoroughfares connecting terminals and yards known as mainline track track within terminals and switching yards track adjacent to the mainlines used for passing trains track connecting the mainline track to customer locations and track that diverts trains from one track to another known as turnouts total track miles are greater than csxt’s approximately 21000  route miles which reflect the size of csxt’s network that connects markets customers and western railroads at december 2016  the breakdown of track miles was as follows 



in addition to its physical track structure the company operates numerous yards and terminals for rail and intermodal service these serve as hubs between the company and its local customers and as sorting facilities where railcars and intermodal containers often are received resorted and placed onto new outbound trains the company’s ten largest yards and terminals based on annual volume number of railcars or intermodal containers processed are listed in the table below

network geography 

csxt’s operations are primarily focused on four major transportation networks and corridors which are defined geographically and by commodity flows below 

interstate 90 i90 corridor  – this csxt corridor links chicago and the midwest to metropolitan areas in new york and new england this route also known as the “waterlevel route” has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks referred to as double track these superior engineering attributes permit the corridor to support consistent highspeed intermodal automotive and merchandise service this corridor is a primary route for import traffic coming from the far east through western ports moving eastward across the country through chicago and into the population centers in the northeast the i90 corridor is also a critical link between ports in new york new jersey and pennsylvania and consumption markets in the midwest this route carries goods from all three of the company’s major markets – merchandise coal and intermodal 

interstate 95 i95 corridor  – the csxt i95 corridor connects charleston jacksonville miami and many other cities throughout the southeast with the heavily populated midatlantic and northeastern cities of baltimore philadelphia and new york csxt primarily transports food and consumer products as well as metals and chemicals along this line it is the leading rail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of the district of columbia and provides access to major eastern ports 

southeastern corridor  – this critical part of the network runs between csxt’s western gateways of chicago st louis and memphis through the cities of nashville birmingham and atlanta and markets in the southeast the southeastern corridor is the premier rail route connecting these key cities gateways and markets and positions csxt to efficiently handle projected traffic volumes of intermodal automotive and general merchandise traffic the corridor also provides direct rail service between the coal reserves of the southern illinois basin and the demand for coal in the southeast 

coal network   – the csxt coal network connects the coal mining operations in the appalachian mountain region and illinois basin with industrial areas in the southeast northeast and midatlantic as well as many river lake and deep water port facilities the domestic coal market has declined significantly over the past several years and export coal remains subject to a high degree of volatility csxt’s coal network remains well positioned to supply utility markets in both the northeast and southeast and to transport coal shipments for export outside of the us roughly onethird  of the tons of export coal and the majority  of the domestic coal that the company transports is used for generating electricity

strategic overview   

csx provides railbased freight transportation services including traditional rail service the transport of intermodal containers and trailers as well as other transportation services such as railtotruck transfers and bulk commodity operations the company and the rail industry provide customers with access to an expansive and interconnected transportation network that plays a key role in north american commerce and is critical to the longterm economic success and improved global competitiveness of the united states in addition freight railroads provide the most economical and environmentally efficient means to transport goods over land 

csxs transportation solutions connect industries and population centers across the united states with each other and with global markets through access to over 70 port facilities allowing the company to meet the dynamic transportation needs of manufacturers industrial producers construction companies farmers and feed mills wholesalers and retailers energy producers and the us armed forces through its network the company transports a diverse portfolio of commodities and products to meet the countrys needs these products range from agricultural goods such as grains to chemicals automobiles metals building materials paper consumer products and energy sources like coal ethanol and liquefied petroleum gas the company categorizes these products into three primary lines of business merchandise intermodal and coal 

to support longterm growth and value creation consistent with the evolving trends in freight transportation csx has launched a new strategic initiative known as the csx of tomorrow  a safe highly automated resourceefficient railroad enabling service excellence profitable growth and improved cash flow the csx of tomorrow  is comprised of four distinct strategic pillars and builds on the company’s vision purpose and core values 

csx of tomorrow strategic initiatives 

network of tomorrow 

the csx of tomorrow relies on the reach capability and efficiency of the company’s rail network to safely and effectively meet the demands of the evolving marketplace and provide increasingly flexible and responsive service to more diverse customers to facilitate future productivity and growth csx is implementing a fundamentally new approach to the network—transforming the railroad into two interconnected networks a primary network and a local network the company is expanding capacity in its primary network to enable increasingly dense traffic while providing improved service for customers and enabling future growth further the company’s capacity investments along the primary network will allow for additional train lengthening improving efficiency and profitability the local network will be operated at lower density and speed and will better allow for new customer site development as a result of easier access to the local network and the company’s enhanced focus on local pickup and delivery of freight to customers 

expanding capacity on us rail networks provides substantial public benefits including job creation increased business activity at us ports reduced highway congestion and lower air emissions therefore csx and its government partners are jointly working to invest in multiyear rail infrastructure projects these publicprivate partnerships are a critical part of the network of tomorrow strategy for the company an example of one of these initiatives is the national gateway which is a publicprivate partnership that will increase intermodal capacity and create substantial environmental and efficiency advantages by clearing key corridors between midatlantic ports and the midwest for doublestack intermodal trains

the modernization of the virginia avenue tunnel in washington dc is the capstone project for the second and final phase of the national gateway this project improves the flow of freight traffic through the district of columbia and eliminates a rail traffic bottleneck that also impacts commuter and passenger trains in the region csx completed the first of two new doublestackcleared tunnels in 2016 and the second tunnel will be finished in late 2018 with the completion of the first tunnel 95 of csx intermodal freight now moves in doublestack service going forward csx will continue to explore other opportunities to partner with the public sector to maximize the many public benefits of freight rail 

going forward csx will continue to explore other opportunities to partner with the public sector to maximize the many public benefits of freight rail the network of tomorrow along with enhanced operational efficiency will allow csx to continue to improve safety lower the cost structure and provide superior service to customers 

service excellence 

service excellence has long been a core component of csx’s culture that engages all employees to focus on delivering value to customers through improved service levels communications tools and advanced technologies as part of the csx of tomorrow  the company will continually strive to consistently meet or exceed customer commitments while ensuring all interactions with customers result in a positive experience improving the customer experience will allow csx to continue delivering a safe reliable and competitive product while enhancing the ability to profitably grow the business and continue to value price its service product in addition service excellence across the network of tomorrow will enable additional volume growth opportunities with new and existing customers especially in the company’s intermodal and merchandise businesses 

for example csx’s intermodal network connects all major population centers east of the mississippi river and positions the company to capture a significant share of the growing domestic intermodal market opportunity currently estimated at nine million truckloads in the eastern united states that move over 550 miles the company’s highwaytorail initiative assists in growing this traffic by helping customers identify new conversion opportunities for both domestic intermodal moves and the us portion of international intermodal moves 

to further enhance the company’s intermodal offering and support future growth csx announced a new terminal in eastern north carolina known as the carolina connector to capture local regional national and international intermodal freight movement opportunities prevalent in the vibrant midatlantic market this new terminal will be poised to replicate and leverage the success of the northwest ohio intermodal terminal by expanding the reach of the company’s hub and spoke network strategy to provide further profitable growth network connectivity and density especially in smaller and midsized markets 

csx continues to proactively seek the right opportunities to profitably grow the merchandise business the company will continue capitalizing on new opportunities to locate industries on the csx network especially on the local network where network connectivity costs will generally be the lowest for customers through industrial development the company helps new and existing customers grow their business and target new markets by providing access to precertified locations as well as project management services 

the company’s coal markets have shifted dramatically over the past several years and continue to rapidly evolve domestic utility coal demand decreased again in 2016 relative to previous years while export coal remains subject to a high degree of volatility as a result of changes in the global economy competition from foreign producers and regulatory impacts on coal mining in the united states longerterm downward pressure on domestic utility coal volumes will likely persist as a result of continued low natural gas prices while global coal demand will likely be mixed as developing countries become more urbanized and industrialized countries continue to use an increasing amount of alternative fuels other than coal for electrical power generation csx will continue to provide a competitive service product amid coal’s market shifts while efficiently capitalizing on shortterm demand fluctuations

highly automated railroad 

for many years csx has utilized technology to enhance operational performance and decisionmaking the csx of tomorrow will build upon this expertise and increasingly leverage technology focusing on automation advanced analytics and the use of mobility tools innovation and process improvement csx is accelerating its technology investments to improve safety resource efficiency asset reliability and service levels for customers several key initiatives aimed at generating longterm value are focused on automating and optimizing critical operations across the company csx will continue to implement specific workforce and regulatory strategies to ensure the safe effective adoption of new technologies as the company progresses towards becoming a highly automated railroad 

team of tomorrow 

csx’s approximately 27000  dedicated employees are the driving force behind the csx of tomorrow  contributing to the successful development and implementation of all strategic initiatives as the csx of tomorrow requires an increasingly diverse skillset the team of tomorrow will be a highlycapable flexible collaborative team relentlessly focused on safety service and value creation to attract retain and motivate the best talent in the marketplace csx will continue to provide a compelling value proposition for its employees the company is going to further enhance its investment in employee development provide career opportunities have marketcompetitive employee benefits and continue to reward the creation of customer and employee excellence through the team of tomorrow initiative csx strives to align our people with a culture that embraces the company’s vision purpose and core values to safely and efficiently serve our customers and help ensure the successful implementation of the csx of tomorrow  

balanced approach to cash deployment 

csx remains highly committed to delivering value to shareholders through a balanced approach to deploying cash that includes investments in the business dividend growth and share repurchases in 2016 the company invested 27 billion  to further enhance the safety reliability efficiency flexibility and capability of its network and its overall business in addition during 2016 csx repaid 14 billion  in outstanding debt to capitalize on the lower interest rate environment 

the company continues to return value to its shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases during 2016  the company paid a quarterly cash dividend of 018  per common share with total dividends paid to shareholders of 680 million  for the year also in 2016  csx continued share repurchases under its 20 billion  program which began in 2015 and is expected to be completed by april 2017 csx repurchased 11 billion  or 38 million  shares during 2016  under this program as part of this balanced approach the company is committed to maintaining a credit profile consistent with a bbb rating by standard  poor’s and a baa1 rating by moody’s investment services 

summary 

the strategic initiatives and opportunities as well as the strategic investments discussed above provide a foundation for volume growth continued value pricing productivity improvement enhanced customer service and continued advancements in the safety and reliability of operations to continue these types of investments the company must be able to operate in a balanced regulatory environment in which it can generate adequate returns and drive shareholder value these investments will enable the company to deliver the csx of tomorrow  a safe highly automated resourceefficient railroad enabling service excellence profitable growth and improved cash flow

revenue 

in 2016 revenue decreased 742 million or six percent due to a five percent decline in volume including the 178 million positive impact of an extra week of volume and a significant decline in fuel recoveries partially offset by pricing strength 

merchandise 

agricultural 

agricultural and food products    volume declined as the strong us dollar continued to support import grain and a robust southeastern crop spurred additional local truck sourcing displacing grain shipments by rail additionally ethanol market dynamics shifted to favor the gulf region for storage and export precluding csx from participation in shipments from western origins to the gulf 

fertilizers   volume was flat as the strong us dollar which drove high levels of imported sulfur displaced rail transport and nitrogen demand fell in anticipation of further commodity price deterioration this offset growth in phosphate rock driven by operational efficiency that allowed for additional rail traffic conversion that would otherwise move by truck  

industrial 

chemicals   volume declined as energy market headwinds significantly reduced crude oil and frac sand shipments this reduction was partially offset by the ramp up of a fly ash remediation project and a modest increase in core chemical markets 

  

automotive   volume increased as a result of strong north american light vehicle production and growth across several customers additionally movement of trucks and suvs continued to outpace passenger cars consistent with customer buying patterns 

metals and equipment   volume was down as the strong us dollar allowed for continued high levels of steel imports which led to reduced domestic steel production mill closures and the loss of associated rail moves these declines were partially offset by strength in the windenergy and power generation markets 

housing and construction 

minerals   volume was up slightly due to strong gains in aggregates which include crushed stone sand and gravel particularly for highway and nonresidential construction in southern markets the growth was partially offset by headwinds in salt and lime reflecting mild winter weather and steel production challenges respectively 

forest products   volume declined as headwinds from electronic substitution and reduced paper products demand drove industry consolidation that reduced rail volume further excess truck capacity in 2016 captured some volume that traditionally moved by rail 

coal 

domestic   volume declined as mild winter weather in the beginning of the year and low natural gas prices reduced utility coal burn rates and resulted in inflated coal stockpiles   further the weak domestic integrated steel market drove volume decreases in coke 

export   volume was down in both metallurgical and thermal coal as a result of the strong us dollar and global oversupply which impacted us competitiveness in the world market particularly in the first half of the year

intermodal 

domestic   volume increased as secular growth from the highwaytorail conversion program and new service offerings were partially offset by excess truck capacity headwinds and a shorthaul competitive loss 

international   volume declined as headwinds from competitive losses more than offset moderate growth across other customers 

other 

other revenue decreased 110 million versus prior year primarily due to payments received in 2015 from customers that did not meet volume commitments further decreases in incidental revenue as well as lower coal revenue from affiliates were partially offset by adjustments to revenue reserves

other income expense  net   decreased   52 million  to 46 million  primarily due to a prior year 59 million gain on a sale of nonoperating easements and reimbursement of environmental costs of 21 million related to this sale this decrease was partially offset by other nonoperating items none of which were individually significant 

income tax expense   decreased   143 million  to 10 billion  primarily due to lower earnings 

net earnings   decreased   254 million  to 17 billion  and earnings per diluted share decreased   019  to 181  due to the factors mentioned above lower average shares outstanding resulting from higher share repurchase activity had a positive impact on earnings per diluted share

in 2015 revenue decreased 858 million or seven percent mostly due to the decline in fuel surcharge of 646 million additionally the decline in volume of two percent and unfavorable mix were partially offset by pricing strength 

merchandise 

agricultural 

agricultural and food products   volume declined due to challenging world market conditions and a strong us dollar specifically high levels of imported ethanol reduced rail moves to eastern markets and the strong dollar hampered export grain competitiveness additionally excess truck capacity led to lower shipments of food products these declines were partially offset by strength in feed grain and domestic soybean moves reflecting the record 20142015 harvest 

fertilizers   volume was down reflecting weak demand driven by oversupply of fertilizer low corn prices and a challenged export market due to strength of the us dollar 

industrial 

chemicals   volume was flat as strong gains in lpg and petroleum products were offset by the slowdown in crude oil and frac sand due to low oil prices and the conclusion of major waste remediation projects 

  

automotive   volume increased as gains in auto movement especially suvs and trucks resulted from strong north american light vehicle production and consumer demand 

metals and equipment   volume declined primarily due to high levels of steel imports which resulted from the strength of the us dollar and led to lower production of domestic steel 

housing and construction 

minerals   volume growth reflects strength in aggregates which include crushed stone sand and gravel due to increased highway and nonresidential construction activity 

forest products   volume declines reflect high inventories of building products in the housing sector as well as declining demand due to electronic substitution in paper products 

coal 

domestic    volume declined as a result of mild weather high stockpiles and low natural gas prices favoring natural gas power generation 

export    reductions in both metallurgical and thermal coal volume resulted from ongoing weak market conditions due to global oversupply and the strength of the us dollar

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures including those to address regulatory and legislative requirements to have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity its balance sheet sources and uses of cash flow and external factors should be reviewed 

material changes in the consolidated balance sheets and significant cash flows 

consolidated balance sheets 

csxs balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of csxs balanced approach in deploying capital for the benefit of its shareholders which includes investments in infrastructure dividend payments and share repurchases 

total assets as well as total liabilities and shareholders equity increased   669 million  from prior year the increase in assets was driven by higher net properties of 976 million  resulting from capital investments partially offset by payments of about 300 million made on debt related to assets purchased in 2015 under seller financing the increase in total liabilities and shareholders equity combined was driven by an increase in net borrowings of about 450 million including payments made on debt for assets purchased in 2015 under seller financing and an increase in deferred income tax liabilities of 417 million partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in other longterm liabilities due to voluntary pension contributions of 250 million 

significant cash flows

part ii 

sources of cash 

the company has multiple sources of cash first the company generates cash from operations in 2016  the company generated 30 billion  of cash from operating activities which was 329 million  lower than prior year primarily driven by 250 million in voluntary contributions to the companys qualified pension plans in 2015 the company generated 34 billion  of cash from operating activities which was 27 million  higher than 2014 primarily driven by higher collections of freight account receivables 

second csx has access to numerous financing sources including a 1 billion fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in may 2020 as of the date of this filing the company has no outstanding balances under this facility see note 9 debt and credit agreements for more information 

third csx filed a new shelf registration statement with the sec in february 2016 which is unlimited as to amount and may be used to issue debt or equity securities at csx’s discretion subject to market conditions and csx board authorization while csx seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit csx to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time or at all 

uses of cash 

csx continued to invest in its business to create longterm value for shareholders in 2016  net cash used in investing activities was 18 billion  a decrease of 11 billion  from the prior year primarily driven by lower net purchases of shortterm investments and lower property additions in 2015 net cash used in investing activities was 29 billion  an increase in net investing of 709 million  from 2014 primarily driven by fewer net sales of shortterm investments 

the company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for longterm growth through expanding network and terminal capacity funds used for property additions are further described below

planned capital investments for 2017 are expected to be 22 billion  including about 270 million  for ptc this 22 billion  excludes investments related to partially or wholly reimbursable publicprivate partnerships where reimbursements may not be fully received in the year the reimbursement obligation arises approximately half of the 2017 investment will be used to sustain the core infrastructure the remaining amounts will be allocated to locomotives freight cars and high return projects supporting longterm profitable growth productivity initiatives and service improvements to optimize performance csx intends to fund capital investments through cash generated from operations 

the company expects to continue incurring significant capital costs in connection with the implementation of ptc csx estimates that the total multiyear cost of ptc implementation will be approximately  24 billion  this estimate includes costs for installing the new system along tracks upgrading locomotives adding communication equipment and developing new technologies total ptc spending through 2016 was  18 billion  

in addition to capital investments the company uses cash for scheduled payments of debt and leases share repurchases and to pay dividends to shareholders in 2016 net cash used in financing activities was 13 billion  which represents an increase in spending of 749 million  from the prior year primarily driven by the repayment of sellerfinanced assets higher share repurchases and lower net debt issued in 2015 net cash used in financing activities was 519 million  which represents a decrease  in spending of 564 million  from the prior year primarily driven by higher net longterm debt issued of 904 million net of lower debt repayments partially offset by higher share repurchases of 287 million 

csx is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments csx may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors under item 1a of this form 10k 

liquidity and working capital 

currently csx is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint the company ended the year with 10 billion  of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments csx has a 1 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks this facility expires in may 2020 and as of the date of this filing the company has no outstanding balances under this facility additionally in 2016  csx issued a total of 22 billion  of new longterm debt 14 billion  of which was used to repay outstanding debt to capitalize on the lower interest rate environment csx uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes which may include repayment of additional indebtedness outstanding from time to time repurchases of csxs common stock capital investments working capital requirements and improvements in productivity and other cost reduction initiatives see note 9 debt and credit agreements 

in september 2016 the company renewed and modified its existing receivables securitization facility the facility was extended with a three year term scheduled to expire in september 2019  it was modified to provide liquidity of up to 200 million  changed from the 250 million  along with modifications to other terms the purpose of this facility is to provide an alternative to commercial paper and a low cost source of shortterm liquidity under the terms of this facility csxt transfers eligible thirdparty receivables to csx trade receivables a bankruptcyremote special purpose subsidiary a separate subsidiary of csx services the receivables upon transfer the receivables become assets of csx trade receivables and are not available to the creditors of csx or any of its other subsidiaries in the event csx trade receivables draws under this facility the company will record an equivalent amount of debt on its consolidated financial statements as of the date of this filing the company has no outstanding balances under this facility 

csx 2016 form 10k p  43

working capital can also be considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its shortterm needs csx had a working capital surplus  of 447 million  at december 2016  and 888 million  after reclassification of current deferred taxes at december 2015  this decrease since the prior year end is primarily due to an increase in longterm debt maturing within a year of 311 million and cash from operations used for property additions share repurchases and dividend payments 

the company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above although the company currently has a surplus a working capital deficit is not unusual for csx or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity the company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due furthermore csx has sufficient financial capacity including its revolving credit facility trade receivable facility and shelf registration statement to manage its daytoday cash requirements and any anticipated obligations the company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity 

credit ratings 

credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” and moody’s investors service “moody’s” use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa for sp and moody’s respectively a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 

  

the cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by csxs longterm credit ratings csxs credit ratings remained stable during 2016  as of december 2015  and december 2016  sps longterm rating on csx was bbb stable and moodys was baa1 stable ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sp and moody’s respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade if csxs credit ratings were to decline to below investment grade levels the company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt in addition a decline in csx’s credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market’s demand and thus the company’s ability to readily issue new debt

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results may differ from those estimates these estimates and assumptions are discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors on a regular basis consistent with the prior year significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas 

 

casualty environmental and legal reserves 

  casualty 

casualty reserves of 229 million  and 269 million  for 2016  and 2015  respectively represent accruals for personal injury occupational disease and occupational injury claims a majority of the casualty reserves relate to personal injuries the companys selfinsured retention amount for these claims is 50 million per occurrence currently no individual claim is expected to exceed the selfinsured retention amount in accordance with the contingencies topic  in the asc to the extent the value of an individual claim exceeds the selfinsured retention amount the company would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries these reserves fluctuate based upon the timing of payments as well as changes in estimate actual results may vary from estimates due to the number type and severity of the injury costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation most of the companys casualty claims relate to csxt unless otherwise noted below defense and processing costs which historically have been insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future are not included in the recorded liabilities 

personal injury 

personal injury reserves of 170 million  and 204 million  for 2016  and 2015  represent liabilities for employee workrelated and thirdparty injuries workrelated injuries for csxt employees are primarily subject to fela in addition to fela liabilities employees of other current or former csx subsidiaries are covered by various state workers’ compensation laws the federal longshore and harbor workers’ compensation program or the maritime jones act 

csxt retains an independent actuary to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims an analysis is performed by the actuary quarterly and is reviewed by management the methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims it is based largely on csxts historical claims and settlement experience 

as a direct result of improvements in safety in recent years the company has experienced a downward trend in the severity of injuries which has resulted in a decrease in the estimate of costs per incident during 2016 the company reduced casualty reserves primarily personal injury reserves by 28 million resulting in aftertax effect on earnings from continuing operations and net earnings of 18 million and an aftertax effect on earnings per share of 002 the personal injury reserve reductions were included in materials supplies and other on the consolidated income statements during 2015 and 2014 there were no significant changes in estimate recorded to adjust casualty reserves

critical accounting estimates  continued 

occupational 

occupational reserves of 59 million  and 65 million  for 2016  and 2015  respectively represent liabilities for occupational disease claims and occupational injury claims occupational disease claims arise primarily from allegations of exposure to asbestos in the workplace occupational injury claims arise from allegations of exposure to certain other materials in the workplace such as solvents soaps chemicals collectively referred to as “irritants” and diesel fuels like exhaust fumes or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions such as repetitive stress injuries the company has experienced a downward trend in the number of occupational claims and reserves for these claims have decreased to a level that is no longer material to the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

environmental 

environmental reserves were 95 million  and 82 million  and 2016   and 2015  respectively the company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 222  environmentally impaired sites many of these are or may be subject to remedial action under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 cercla also known as the superfund law or similar state statutes most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations a number of these proceedings however are based on allegations that the company or its predecessors sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment recycling or disposal in addition some of the company’s land holdings were leased to others for commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the company 

in any such proceedings the company is subject to environmental cleanup and enforcement actions under the superfund law as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct these costs could be substantial 

in accordance with the asset retirement and environmental obligations topic  in the asc the company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least quarterly giving consideration to a number of factors such as 

 

csx 2016 form 10k p  48

critical accounting estimates  continued 

based on the review process the company has recorded amounts to cover contingent anticipated future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are reasonably estimable and probable the recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted the liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated insurance recoveries payments related to these liabilities are expected to be made over the next several years environmental remediation costs are included in materials supplies and other on the consolidated income statement 

currently the company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities if any on some sites until completion of future environmental studies in addition conditions that are currently unknown could at any given location result in additional exposure the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated based upon information currently available however the company believes its environmental reserves accurately reflect the cost of remedial actions currently required 

legal 

in accordance with the contingencies topic  in the asc an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated if no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred

the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried management personnel for employees hired prior to 2003 the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement for employees hired in 2003 or thereafter benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age service and compensation   as of december 2016  the projected benefit obligation for the company’s pension plans was 29 billion  

in addition to these plans the company sponsors a postretirement medical plan and a life insurance plan that provide certain benefits to fulltime salaried management employees hired prior to 2003 upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met eligible retirees who are age 65 years or older medicareeligible are covered by a health reimbursement arrangement which is an employerfunded account that can be used for reimbursement of eligible medical expenses eligible retirees younger than 65 years nonmedicare eligible are covered by a selfinsured program partially funded by participating retirees the life insurance plan is noncontributory as of december 2016  the projected benefit obligation for the company’s other postretirement benefit plans was 274 million

the accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the compensationretirement benefits topic  in the asc this rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following 

 

the company engages independent actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the company determines are appropriate based on historical trends current market rates and future projections these amounts are reviewed by management 

discount rates 

discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component of pension and postretirement expense discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other postretirement benefits could be effectively settled or in other words how much it would cost the company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the companys expected future benefit payments the company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of yearend for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans expected benefit payments 

the discount rates used by the company to value its 2016  pension and postretirement obligations are 408 percent  and 371 percent  respectively for 2015  the discount rate used by the company to value its pension and postretirement obligations was 430 percent  and 385 percent  respectively discount rates may differ for pension and postretirement benefits due to varying duration of the liabilities for projected payments for each plan as of december 2016  the estimated duration of pensions and postretirement benefits is approximately 12  years and eight  years respectively   

each year these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates in general if interest rates decline or rise the assumed discount rates will change 

longterm rate of return on plan assets 

the expected longterm average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation in estimating that rate the company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected longterm rate of return on assets as this assumption is longterm the annual review may result in less frequent adjustment than other assumptions used in pension accounting the longterm rate of return on plan assets used by the company to value its benefit cost for the subsequent plan year was 675 percent  and 7 percent  in 2016  and 2015  respectively

salary scale inflation rates 

salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the company the company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates the company used a salary scale rate of 460 percent  in both 2016  and 2015  to value its pension obligations 

other assumptions 

the calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to health care cost trend rates mortality rates turnover and retirement age these assumptions are based upon historical data recent plan experience and industry trends and are determined by management 

2017  estimated pension and postretirement expense 

net pension expense and postretirement benefits expense for 2017  are each expected to be approximately 10 million  compared to 58 million  and 17 million  respectively in 2016  the decrease in expense is primarily due to a change in approach to measuring service and interest costs the impact of 250 million in voluntary pension contributions and other favorable plan experience 

in 2017  the company will measure the service and interest cost components of the net pension and postretirement benefits expense by using individual spot rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year instead of a single weightedaverage discount rate approach which has been used in prior years 

the company made this change to improve the correlation between projected pension and postretirement benefit liability cash flows and the corresponding spot discount rates and to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs under the spot rate approach individual spot discount rates along the same high quality corporate bonds yield curve used to measure the pension and postretirement benefit liabilities are applied to the relevant projected cash flows at the relevant maturity   the calculated pension and postretirement benefits liabilities are consistent under both the traditional and spot rate approaches the company accounted for this change on a prospective basis as a change in accounting estimate  

the following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effects of a one percent change in certain assumptions like discount rates longterm rate of return and salaries on the 2017  estimated pension and postretirement expense

depreciation policies for assets utilizing the grouplife method 

the company depreciates its rail assets including mainline track locomotives and freight cars using the grouplife method of accounting assets depreciated under the grouplife method comprise 86 percent  of total fixed assets of 43 billion  on a gross basis at december 2016  all other assets of the company are depreciated on a straightline basis the grouplife method aggregates assets with similar lives and characteristics into groups and depreciates each of these groups as a whole when using the grouplife method an underlying assumption is that each group of assets as a whole is used and depreciated to the end of its recoverable life 

the company currently utilizes more than 130  different depreciable asset categories to account for depreciation expense for the railroad assets that are depreciated under the grouplife method of accounting examples of depreciable asset categories include 18  different categories for crossties due to the different combinations of density classifications and asset types by utilizing various depreciable categories the company can more accurately account for the use of its assets all assets of the company are depreciated on a time or life basis 

the company believes the grouplife method of depreciation closely approximates the straightline method of depreciation additionally due to the nature of most of its assets eg track is one contiguous connected asset the company believes that this is the most effective way to properly depreciate its assets 

management performs a detailed review of depreciation expense and useful lives on a regular basis under the grouplife method of accounting the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying managements assumptions regarding the service lives of its properties a depreciation study also referred to as a life study is the periodic review of asset service lives salvage values accumulated depreciation and other related factors for group assets conducted by a thirdparty specialist analyzed by the company’s management and approved by the stb the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices the stb requires depreciation studies be performed for equipment assets generally every three  years and for road eg bridges and signals and track eg rail ties and ballast assets generally every six  years the company believes the frequency currently required by the stb provides adequate review of asset service lives and that a more frequent review would not result in a material change due to the longlived nature of most of the assets in 2016 the company completed a depreciation study for its equipment assets in 2014 the company completed a depreciation study for its road and track assets the company plans to complete the next depreciation study for road and track assets in 2020 and for equipment assets in 2019 

changes in asset service lives due to the results of the depreciation studies are applied on a prospective basis and could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense and thus the companys results of operations 

csx 2016 form 10k p  52 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates  continued 

there are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include 

   

recent experience with depreciation studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes that did not materially affect the company’s annual depreciation expense of 13 billion  12 billion  and 12 billion  for 2016  2015  and 2014 respectively a 1  change in the average life of all grouplife assets would result in an approximate 12 million  change to the company’s annual depreciation expense 

for retirements or disposals of depreciable rail assets that occur in the ordinary course of business the asset cost net of salvage value or sales proceeds is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized as individual assets within a specific group are retired resulting gains and losses are recorded in accumulated depreciation this practice is consistent with accounting treatment normally prescribed under the grouplife method as part of the depreciation study an assessment of the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is made to determine if it is deficient or in excess of the appropriate amount indicated by the study any such deficiency or excess including any deferred gains or losses is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service life of the asset group until the next required depreciation study since the overall assumption with grouplife is that the assets within the group on average have the same service life and characteristics it is therefore concluded that the deferred gains and losses offset over time 

in the event that large groups of assets are removed from service as a result of unusual acts or sales resulting gains and losses are recognized immediately these acts are not considered to be in the normal course of business and are therefore recognized when incurred examples of such acts would be the major destruction of assets due to significant storm damage eg major hurricanes the sale of a rail line segment to another railroad or the disposal of an entire class of assets eg disposal of all refrigerated freight cars 

income taxes 

csx accounts for income taxes in accordance with the income taxes topic  in the asc that addresses how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under this topic the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the amount recognized in the financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent  likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution

company history 

a leader in freight rail transportation for nearly 190 years the company’s heritage dates back to the early nineteenth century when the baltimore and ohio railroad company “bo” – the nation’s first common carrier – was chartered in 1827 since that time the company has built on this foundation to create a railroad that could safely and reliably service the everincreasing demands of a growing nation 

  

since its founding numerous railroads have combined with the former bo through merger and consolidation to create what has become csx each of the railroads that combined into the csx family brought new geographical reach to valuable markets gateways cities ports and transportation corridors 

  

csx was incorporated in 1978 under virginia law in 1980 the company completed the merger of the chessie system and seaboard coast line industries into csx the merger allowed the company to connect northern population centers and appalachian coal fields to growing southeastern markets later the company’s acquisition of key portions of conrail inc conrail allowed csxt to link the northeast including new england and the new york metropolitan area with chicago and midwestern markets as well as the growing areas in the southeast already served by csxt this current rail network allows the company to directly serve every major market in the eastern united states with safe dependable environmentally responsible and fuel efficient freight transportation and intermodal service 

  

competition 

the business environment in which the company operates is highly competitive shippers typically select transportation providers that offer the most compelling combination of service and price service requirements both in terms of transit time and reliability vary by shipper and commodity as a result the company’s primary competition varies by commodity geographic location and mode of available transportation and includes other railroads motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and to a less significant extent barges ships and pipelines 

  

csxt’s primary rail competitor is norfolk southern railway which operates throughout much of the company’s territory other railroads also operate in parts of the company’s territory depending on the specific market competing railroads and deregulated motor carriers may exert pressure on price and service levels for further discussion on the risk of competition to the company see item 1a risk factors

regulatory environment 

the companys operations are subject to various federal state provincial canada and local laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses operating in the united states and canada in the us the railroad operations conducted by the companys subsidiaries including csxt are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the surface transportation board “stb” the federal railroad administration “fra” and its sister agency within the us department of transportation the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration “phmsa” together fra and phmsa have broad jurisdiction over railroad operating standards and practices including track freight cars locomotives and hazardous materials requirements in addition the us environmental protection agency “epa” has regulatory authority with respect to matters that impact the companys properties and operations the epa is considering regulatory action directed towards the railroad industry governing the disposal of creosote crossties and seeking to increase air emission regulations that may impact our operations or increase costs similarly the transportation security administration “tsa” a component of the department of homeland security has broad authority over railroad operating practices that may have homeland security implications in canada the railroad operations conducted by the company’s subsidiaries including csxt are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the canadian transportation agency 

    

although the staggers act of 1980 significantly deregulated the us rail industry the stb has broad jurisdiction over rail carriers the stb regulates routes fuel surcharges conditions of service rates for nonexempt traffic acquisitions of control over rail common carriers and the transfer extension or abandonment of rail lines among other railroad activities 

positive train control 

in 2008 congress enacted the rail safety improvement act the “rsia” the legislation included a mandate that all class i freight railroads implement an interoperable positive train control system “ptc” by december 31 2015 implementation of a ptc system is designed to prevent traintotrain collisions overspeed derailments incursions into established workzone limits and train diversions onto another set of tracks on october 29 2015 the president of the united states signed the positive train control enforcement and implementation act of 2015 into law extending the deadline this act requires the installation of all ptc hardware be completed by december 31 2018 and assuming certain conditions are met requires that the ptc system be fully operational by december 31 2020 

ptc must be installed on all main lines with passenger and commuter operations as well as most of those over which toxicbyinhalation hazardous materials are transported the company expects to incur significant capital costs in connection with the implementation of ptc as well as related ongoing operating expenses csx currently estimates that the total multiyear cost of ptc implementation will be approximately 22 billion  for the company total ptc investment through 2015  was  15 billion  

  

stb proceedings 

in 2012 the stb announced it would accept comments on a proposal by the national industrial transportation league that would require class i railroads to provide a form of competitive access to customers served solely by one railroad under this proposal csx would be required to allow a competing railroad to access certain customers that are currently solely served by csxs network in early 2013 shippers railroads and other parties submitted comments on the proposal and the stb held a hearing in march 2014 to receive further input from participating parties since the hearing the stb has taken no further action in the proceeding 

in april 2014 the stb announced it would receive comments to explore its methodology for determining railroad revenue adequacy the revenue adequacy standard represents the level of profitability for a healthy carrier shippers railroads and other parties filed comments in late 2014 more recently the stb held a hearing in july 2015 to receive further input from participating parties since the hearing the stb has taken no further action in the proceeding

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the companys forwardlooking statements additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the company or that the company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

new legislation or regulatory changes could impact the companys earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices 

legislation passed by congress or new regulations issued by federal agencies can significantly affect the revenues costs and profitability of the companys business for instance several of the proposals under consideration by the stb could have a significant negative impact on the companys ability to negotiate prices for the value of rail services provided and meet service standards which could force a reduction in capital spending in addition statutes imposing price constraints or affecting railtorail competition could adversely affect the companys profitability 

  

government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the companys operations and financial results 

the company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies including the stb fra phmsa tsa epa and other state provincial and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic health safety labor environmental tax legal and other matters new or modified rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the companys operating costs or reduce operating efficiencies and impact service performance for example the rsia mandates that the installation of ptc hardware be completed by december 31 2018 and assuming certain conditions are met requires that the ptc system be fully operational by december 31 2020 on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that have commuter or passenger operations noncompliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the company and can subject the company to fines penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions

climate change and other emissionsrelated legislation and regulation could adversely affect the companys operations and financial results 

climate change and other emissionsrelated legislation and regulation have been proposed and in some cases adopted on the federal state provincial and local levels these final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions caps taxes or other controls on emissions in particular the epa has issued various regulations and is expected to issue additional regulations targeting emissions including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles 

any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations could adversely affect the companys operations and financial results by among other things i reducing coalfired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards ii reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the united states and canada iii increasing the companys fuel capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies and iv making it difficult for the companys customers in the us and canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner any of these factors could reduce the amount of shipments the company handles and have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

capacity constraints could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency 

csxt may experience rail network difficulties related to i increased volume ii locomotive or crew shortages iii extreme weather conditions iv increased passenger activities including highspeed rail or v regulatory changes impacting where and how fast   csxt can transport freight or maintain routes which could have a negative effect on csxts operational fluidity leading to deterioration of service asset utilization and overall efficiency 

global economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight 

a decline or disruption in general domestic and global economic conditions that affects demand for the commodities and products the company transports including import and export volume could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects on the companys cost structure and profitability for example if the rate of economic growth in asia slows or if european economies contract us export coal volume could be adversely impacted resulting in lower revenue for csx if the company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products the company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs associated with the storage of locomotives railcars and other equipment workforce adjustments and other related activities which could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

  

changing dynamics in the us and global energy markets could negatively impact profitability 

over the past few years production of natural gas in the us has also increased dramatically which has resulted in lower natural gas prices as a result of sustained low natural gas prices many coalfired power plants have been displaced by natural gasfired power generation facilities if natural gas prices were to remain low additional coalfired plants could be displaced which would likely further reduce the companys domestic coal volumes and revenues 

  

additionally depressed crude oil prices due to increased supply or lower demand could result in a decrease in domestic crude oil production which could have an adverse effect on crude oil volumes for csx in addition new regulations related to the shipment of crude oil by rail including proposed rail car safety standards could increase costs for csx negatively impact network fluidity or have an adverse impact on customers

csxt as a common carrier by rail is required by law to transport hazardous materials which could expose the company to significant costs and claims 

a train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury property or natural resource damage environmental penalties and remediation obligations such claims if insured could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates under federal regulations csxt is required to transport hazardous materials under the legal duty referred to as the common carrier mandate 

csxt is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials in november 2008 the tsa issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail noncompliance with these rules can subject the company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident finally legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances which could increase operating costs reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials 

  

the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs 

the company is subject to wideranging federal state provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions into the air ground and water the handling storage use generation transportation and disposal of waste and other materials the cleanup of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees if the company violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations csx could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators the company can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which csx is responsible in certain circumstances environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties leased properties adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or company predecessors as well as to properties currently owned leased or used by the company 

  

the company has been and may in the future be subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated or is strictly liable under environmental laws or regulations and such violations can result in the companys incurring fines penalties or costs relating to the cleanup of environmental contamination although the company believes it has appropriately recorded current and longterm liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing the company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination 

  

the company relies on the security stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business 

the company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business the performance and reliability of the companys technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively    a cybersecurity attack which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems or other significant disruption or failure could result in a service interruption train accident misappropriation of confidential information process failure security breach or other operational difficulties such an event could result in increased capital insurance or operating costs including increased security costs to protect the companys infrastructure a disruption or compromise of the companys information technology systems even for short periods of time could have a material adverse effect on the company

disruption of the supply chain could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs 

the capital intensive nature and sophistication of core rail equipment including rolling stock equipment locomotives rail and ties limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers if any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage csxt could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage in addition a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and as such adverse developments in international relations new trade regulations disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase csxts operating costs additionally if a fuel supply shortage were to arise whether due to production restrictions lower refinery outputs a disruption of oil imports adverse political developments or otherwise the company would be negatively impacted 

  

failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes andor work stoppages 

    most of csxs employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements most of these agreements are bargained for nationally by the national carriers conference committee and negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages under the railway labor acts procedures which include mediation coolingoff periods and the possibility of an intervention of the us president during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted if however csx is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements or if terms of existing agreements are disputed the employees covered by the railway labor act could strike which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members 

the company faces competition from other transportation providers 

the company experiences competition in pricing service reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and to a less significant extent barges ships and pipelines other transportation providers generally use public rightsofway that are built and maintained by governmental entities while csxt and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks could negatively impact the companys competitive position additionally any future consolidation in the rail industry could materially affect the regulatory and competitive environment in which the company operates 

future acts of terrorism war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the companys operations 

terrorist attacks along with any government response to those attacks may adversely affect the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity csxts rail lines other key infrastructure and information technology systems may be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war this risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues in addition premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the company could increase dramatically or the coverage may no longer be available 

  

furthermore in response to the heightened risk of terrorism federal state and local governmental bodies are proposing and in some cases have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry for example the department of homeland security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials complying with these or future regulations could continue to increase the companys operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies

severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage 

the companys operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences including floods fires hurricanes and earthquakes as a result the companys rail network may be damaged its workforce may be unavailable fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur in addition the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions insurance maintained by the company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations depending on the nature of the risk insured this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the companys damages or damages to others and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates even with insurance if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service the company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations 

the company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures 

as part of its railroad and other operations the company is subject to various claims and lawsuits related to disputes over commercial practices labor and unemployment matters occupational and personal injury claims property damage environmental and other matters the company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits although the company establishes reserves and maintains insurance to cover these types of claims final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may differ materially from the recorded reserves and exceed the companys insurance coverage additionally the company is subject to adverse developments not currently reflected in the companys reserve estimates 

the unavailability of critical resources could adversely affect the company’s operational efficiency and ability to meet demand   

marketplace conditions for resources like locomotives as well as the availability of qualified personnel particularly engineers and trainmen could each have a negative impact on the company’s ability to meet demand for rail service although the company believes that it has adequate personnel for the current business environment unpredictable increases in demand for rail services or extreme weather conditions may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on the company’s operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity in a particular period 

weaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the company’s access to capital 

due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient railroad the company regularly relies on capital markets for the issuance of longterm debt instruments as well as on bank financing from time to time instability or disruptions of the capital markets including credit markets or the deterioration of the company’s financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit access and could increase the cost of financing sources a significant deterioration of the company’s financial condition could also reduce credit ratings and could limit or affect its access to external sources of capital and increase the costs of short and longterm debt financing

 item 2 properties 

the company’s properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure locomotives and freight cars and equipment these categories and the geography of the network are described below 

track and infrastructure 

serving 23  states the district of columbia and the canadian provinces of ontario and quebec the csxt rail network serves among other markets new york philadelphia and boston in the northeast and midatlantic the southeast markets of atlanta miami and new orleans and the midwestern cities of st louis memphis and chicago 

csxt’s track structure includes main thoroughfares connecting terminals and yards known as mainline track track within terminals and switching yards track adjacent to the mainlines used for passing trains track connecting the mainline track to customer locations and track that diverts trains from one track to another known as turnouts total track miles are greater than csxt’s approximately 21000  route miles which reflect the size of csxt’s network that connects markets customers and western railroads at december 2015  the breakdown of track miles was as follows 



in addition to its physical track structure csxt operates numerous yards and terminals these serve as hubs between csxt and its local customers and as sorting facilities where railcars often are received resorted and placed onto new outbound trains the company’s ten largest yards and terminals based on annual volume number of railcars or intermodal containers processed are listed in the table below

network geography 

csxt’s operations are primarily focused on four major transportation networks and corridors which are defined geographically and by commodity flows below 

interstate 90 i90 corridor  – this csxt corridor links chicago and the midwest to metropolitan areas in new york and new england this route also known as the “waterlevel route” has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks referred to as double track these superior engineering attributes permit the corridor to support consistent highspeed intermodal automotive and merchandise service this corridor is a primary route for import traffic coming from the far east through western ports moving eastward across the country through chicago and into the population centers in the northeast the i90 corridor is also a critical link between ports in new york new jersey and pennsylvania and consumption markets in the midwest this route carries consumer goods from all three of the company’s major markets – merchandise coal and intermodal 

interstate 95 i95 corridor  – the csxt i95 corridor connects charleston jacksonville miami and many other cities throughout the southeast with the heavily populated midatlantic and northeastern cities of baltimore philadelphia and new york csxt primarily transports food and consumer products as well as metals and chemicals along this line it is the only rail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of the district of columbia and provides access to major eastern ports 

southeastern corridor  – this critical part of the network runs between csxt’s western gateways of chicago st louis and memphis through the cities of nashville birmingham and atlanta and markets in the southeast the southeastern corridor is the premier rail route connecting these key cities gateways and markets and positions csxt to efficiently handle projected traffic volumes of intermodal automotive and general merchandise traffic the corridor also provides direct rail service between the coal reserves of the southern illinois basin and the demand for coal in the southeast 

coal network   – the csxt coal network connects the coal mining operations in the appalachian mountain region and illinois basin with industrial areas in the southeast northeast and midatlantic as well as many river lake and deep water port facilities csxt’s coal network is well positioned to supply utility markets in both the northeast and southeast and to transport coal shipments for export outside of the us roughly onethird  of the tons of export coal and the majority  of the domestic coal that the company transports is used for generating electricity

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

strategic overview 

csx provides railbased freight transportation services including traditional rail service the transport of intermodal containers and trailers as well as other transportation services such as railtotruck transfers and bulk commodity operations with its approximately 29000  dedicated employees the company and the rail industry provide customers with access to an expansive and interconnected transportation network that plays a key role in north american commerce and is critical to the longterm economic success and improved global competitiveness of the united states low natural gas prices increased foreign labor costs and supply chain factors have helped to improve competitiveness of csxs customers over the long term 

the rail industry benefits from this longterm improved global competitiveness continued economic growth and the shift towards more railbased solutions us demand to move more goods by rail is expected to rise and freight railroads provide the most environmentally efficient and economical means to meet this growing demand csx can move a ton of freight about 475 miles on one gallon of diesel fuel as trains are four times more fuel efficient than trucks on average shipping freight by rail also alleviates highway congestion eases air pollution and saves energy 

csxs network reaches nearly twothirds of the us population which accounts for the majority of the nations consumption of goods through this network the company transports a diverse portfolio of commodities and products to meet the countrys needs these products range from agricultural goods such as grains to chemicals automobiles metals building materials paper consumer products and energy sources like coal ethanol and crude oil the company categorizes these products into three primary lines of business merchandise intermodal and coal csxs transportation solutions connect industries and population centers across the united states with each other and with global markets through access to over 70 port facilities whereby meeting the transportation needs of energy producers manufacturers industrial producers construction companies farmers and feed mills wholesalers and retailers and the united states armed forces 

operating initiatives 

to support longterm growth csx is focused on meeting or exceeding customers’ expectations while improving profitability several key operating initiatives have been implemented over the past several years that lay a foundation for meeting these objectives the overall goal is sustained high customer service levels which is in part achieved through a relentless focus on using advanced network modeling analytics and tools to create a disciplined scheduled approach to designing and running csxs network the company continues to identify the most efficient costeffective routes for csxt customers traffic while providing timely service with the fewest handlings and car miles possible 

through the service excellence initiative csx is building a culture that engages all employees and focuses on the value delivered to customers through improved service this initiative increases employee communication and dialogue to help identify and resolve customer issues at the lowest level improving the customer experience and allowing csx to grow the business this process involves engagement from all operating employees as well as collaboration with sales and marketing employees and ultimately with the company’s customers higher levels of customer service and satisfaction support csx’s ability to profitably grow the business by increasing customer retention price sustainability and asset utilization

in addition total service integration “tsi” is intended to align operating capabilities with customers needs resulting in an efficient and effective service product tsi was first implemented in the unit train network where it successfully increased the average number of cars per train and improved asset utilization csx has been implementing tsi in the carload network over the past few years and has focused on improving the “first and last mile” service experience for carload customers providing a more consistent and reliable service product the carload network is connected to more than 5000 customer facilities and has a high degree of variability each day new tools and technology have allowed the company to more effectively communicate with customers not only providing the service the company has promised to deliver but proactively notifying the customer of service status applying tsi to the carload network has improved local customer service satisfaction and local service performance 

finally enterprise asset management “eam” focuses on improving the utilization of the company’s most critical assets namely crews locomotives cars and track infrastructure projects are currently in place to deploy technology improve processes and reduce unproductive time because the railroad is an asset intensive industry eam helps reduce the overall expense associated with asset ownership by monitoring the overall condition of equipment helping proactively schedule maintenance increasing utilization and also effectively managing the investment required for new or replacement assets by improving asset utilization csx expects to sustain longterm operating efficiencies and reduce future capital expenditures associated with asset replacement 

in summary these initiatives are designed to improve service levels in a cost effective manner and enhance the reliability of rail transportation these improvements to operational processes customer communication and service are better aligning csxs operating capabilities with customers needs and are enabling the company to capitalize on the strategic opportunities described below 

strategic opportunities 

intermodal growth 

csx’s intermodal business is a growth opportunity that provides an economical and environmentally friendly alternative to transporting freight on highways via truck csx’s intermodal network connects all major population centers east of the mississippi river and over 90 of intermodal traffic moves in doublestack two containers high service this positions the company to capture a significant share of the incremental domestic intermodal market opportunity estimated at nine million truckloads in the eastern united states that move over 550 miles the company’s highwaytorail initiatives assist in capturing this traffic and also help customers identify conversion opportunities for both domestic moves and the us portion of international moves 

to further enhance the companys intermodal offering and support future growth csx recently completed new or expanded terminal construction to increase network capacity and broaden its market presence in key growth areas in 2015 csx began construction on a new terminal near pittsburgh pa enhancing the company’s reach and supporting continued growth over the past several years the company also opened or expanded seven other terminals in winter haven fl quebec canada columbus oh louisville ky atlanta ga and worcester ma as well as the companys northwest ohio terminal which is part of the national gateway initiative discussed below 

illinois basin coal shift 

energy markets have shifted over the past few years and continue to evolve for instance domestic utility coal demand decreased in 2015 relative to previous years in the long term downward pressure on domestic coal volumes will likely continue as the result of increasingly stringent existing and proposed environmental regulations and continued low natural gas prices in addition mining economics are causing a shift from central appalachian coal to thermal coal in the illinois basin and the powder river basin csx will capitalize on these shifts and address structural costs in the regions of declining volume 

 21 

csx corporation 

part ii 

export coal 

csx export coal volume and pricing is subject to a high degree of volatility as a result of changes in the global economy competition from foreign coal producers and regulatory shifts over the past few years csx has capitalized on the global coal demand in both steel manufacturing and power generation currently both global thermal and metallurgical coal prices are low due to oversupply but csx sees longterm growth in global demand as developing countries become more urbanized the company remains opportunistic based on the global markets and the resulting level of demand 

energy markets 

shale drilling for the extraction of oil and natural gas has created the opportunity for csx to serve energy markets such as crude oil liquefied petroleum gases “lpg” frac sand and other related materials although energy market volume is volatile from year to year for example csx is capitalizing on the opportunity to move the supply of crude oil from the domestic oil fields particularly those located in the bakken shale region of north dakota to customers at eastern refineries this service also provides greater flexibility in source locations as compared to pipelines volume however may vary depending upon oil prices and spreads 

csx’s lpg market is also benefiting from drilling in ohio pennsylvania and west virginia within the utica shale region midstream energy companies which are involved in the transportation storage and wholesale of refined petroleum products are taking advantage of the abundance of inexpensive wet gas with newly constructed gas processing plants or “fractionators” in the region rail will also play a vital role in moving lpg products from the fractionators to the market 

over the longer term the energy supply outlook for the us will create a sustainable competitive advantage for domestic chemical producers and generate additional growth opportunities for rail since natural gas is the primary component in the production of a wide range of petrochemicals the supply growth and the resulting lower prices have now placed the us amongst the lowest cost production regions in the world this increased competitiveness is sparking significant investment in new us chemical industry capacity for the first time in more than a decade csx is wellpositioned to participate in this growing chemical business over the next several years 

publicprivate partnerships 

expanding capacity on us rail networks provides substantial public benefits including job creation increased business activity at us ports reduced highway congestion and lower air emissions therefore csx and its government partners are jointly working to invest in multiyear rail infrastructure projects such as the national gateway this initiative is a publicprivate partnership which will increase intermodal capacity and create substantial environmental and efficiency advantages by clearing key corridors between midatlantic ports and the midwest for doublestack intermodal trains 

as part of the national gateway project csx broke ground on the modernization of the virginia avenue tunnel in washington dc in 2015this project will improve the flow of freight traffic through the district of columbia and will eliminate a railtraffic bottleneck that also impacts commuter and passenger trains in the region the new structure will provide doublestack train clearances in maryland west virginia and the district of columbia going forward csx will continue to explore other opportunities to partner with the public sector to maximize the many public benefits of freight rail

balanced approach to cash deployment 

csx remains highly committed to delivering value to shareholders through a balanced approach to deploying cash that includes investments in the business dividend growth and share repurchases in 2015 the company invested 26 billion  to further enhance the capacity quality safety and flexibility of its network in addition csx continues to return value to its shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases during 2015 the company announced a 13 percent increase in the quarterly cash dividend to 018 per common share the company has increased its quarterly cash dividend 13 times over the last ten years which represents a 26 percent compounded annual growth rate also in 2015 csx announced a new 2 billion share repurchase program which is expected to be completed by april 2017 based on market and business decisions csx repurchased 804 million  or 26 million  shares during 2015 under this program since 2006 csx has repurchased 520 million shares adjusted for stock splits for 96 billion which represents about onehalf of total shares currently outstanding as part of this balanced approach the company is committed to maintaining a credit profile consistent with a bbb rating by standard  poor’s and a baa1 rating by moody’s investment services 

summary 

these operating initiatives strategic areas longterm investments and shareholder returns discussed above provide a foundation for volume growth productivity improvement enhanced customer service and continued advancements in the safety and reliability of operations to continue these types of investments the company must be able to operate in an environment in which it can generate adequate returns and drive shareholder value csx will continue to advocate for a fair and balanced regulatory environment to ensure that the value of the companys rail service would be reflected in any potential new legislation or policies

csx corporation 

part ii 

revenue 

in 2015 revenue decreased 858 million or 7 mostly due to the decline in fuel surcharge of 646 million additionally the decline in volume of 2 and unfavorable mix were partially offset by pricing strength 

merchandise 

agricultural 

agricultural products   volume declined due to challenging world market conditions and a strong us dollar specifically high levels of imported ethanol reduced rail moves to eastern markets and export grain was down significantly these declines were partially offset by strength in feed grain and domestic soybean moves reflecting the record 20142015 harvest 

phosphates and fertilizers   volume was down reflecting weak demand for fertilizers driven by oversupply low corn prices and a challenged export market due to strength of the us dollar 

food and consumer   volume declined as excess truck capacity and poor western crop yields in produce led to lower shipments of fresh foods 

industrial 

chemicals   volume was flat as strong gains in lpg and petroleum products were offset by a slowdown in crude oil and frac sand due to low oil prices 

  

automotive   volume increased as gains in auto movement especially suvs and trucks resulted from strong north american light vehicle production and consumer demand 

metals   volume declined due to high levels of steel imports which resulted from the strength of the us dollar and led to lower production of domestic steel 

housing and construction 

forest products   volume declines reflect high inventories of building products in the housing sector as well as declining demand due to electronic substitution in paper products 

minerals   volume growth reflects strength in aggregates which include crushed stone sand and gravel due to increased highway and nonresidential construction activity 

waste and equipment    volume was down as a result of the conclusion of major remediation projects and reduced military vehicle movement partially offset by increases in municipal waste 

coal 

domestic   volume declined as a result of mild weather high stockpiles and low natural gas prices favoring natural gas power generation 

export   reductions in both metallurgical and thermal coal volume resulted from ongoing weak market conditions due to global oversupply and the strength of the us dollar

revenue 

in 2014 volume increased 6 year over year with growth across most markets revenue increased by 5 year over year driven by this broadbased volume growth 

merchandise 

agricultural 

agricultural products   volume growth was driven by increased shipments of grain and ethanol a combined record corn and soybean crop in 2013 led to higher grain shipments and reduced us corn prices resulting in increased ethanol production in 2014 

phosphates and fertilizers   volume growth was driven by increased shipments of finished fertilizer products to replenish inventories and phosphate rock shipments due to capacity at a customer facility returning to normal levels 

food and consumer   volume declined due to lower shipments of canned goods and rice the decline in canned goods was driven by market losses while rice shipments were lower as customers substituted lowerpriced corn this decline was partially offset by growth in alcoholic beverage shipments due to a customer’s gain in market share 

industrial 

chemicals   volume growth was driven by an increase in energyrelated shipments that included crude oil lpg and frac sand the rise in crude oil shipments to east coast refineries was due to increased supply of lowcost crude oil from shale drilling activity

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures including those to address regulatory and legislative requirements to have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity its balance sheet sources and uses of cash flow and external factors should be reviewed 

material changes in the consolidated balance sheets and significant cash flows 

consolidated balance sheets 

csxs balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of csxs balanced approach in deploying capital for the benefit of its shareholders which includes investments in infrastructure dividend improvement and share repurchases 

total assets as well as total liabilities and shareholders equity increased   20 billion  from prior year the increase in assets was driven by higher net properties of 16 billion  resulting from capital investments as well as higher shortterm investments of 518 million  the increase in total liabilities and shareholders equity combined was driven by net earnings of 19 billion  and new debt of 15 billion which includes about 300 million of deferred seller financing partially offsetting these increases were dividends paid of 686 million  and share repurchases of 804 million  

significant cash flows 

the following tables present net cash provided by used in operating investing and financing activities for full years 2013 2014 and 2015 



sources of cash 

the company has multiple sources of cash first the company generates cash from operations in 2015  the company generated 34 billion  of cash from operating activities which was 27 million  higher than prior year primarily driven by higher collections of freight accounts receivable in 2014 the company generated 33 billion  of cash from operating activities which was 76 million  higher than 2013 primarily driven by higher net earnings 

second csx has access to numerous financing sources including a 1 billion fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in may 2020 as of the date of this filing the company has no outstanding balances under this facility see note 9 debt and credit agreements for more information 

third csx filed a shelf registration statement with the sec in february 2013 which the company expects to renew in february 2016 this shelf registration statement is unlimited as to amount and may be used to issue debt or equity securities at csx’s discretion subject to market conditions and csx board authorization while csx seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit csx to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time or at all

uses of cash 

csx continued to invest in its business to create longterm value for shareholders in 2015  net cash used in investing activities was 29 billion  an increase in net investing of 709 million  from the prior year primarily driven by fewer net sales of shortterm investments in 2014 net cash used in investing activities was 22 billion  a decrease in spending of 44 million  from 2013 primarily driven by higher net sales of shortterm investments 

the company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for longterm growth through expanding network and terminal capacity funds used for property additions are further described below 



   

planned capital investments for 2016 are expected to be 24 billion  including approximately 300 million  for ptc this 24 billion  excludes investments related to partially or wholly reimbursable publicprivate partnerships where reimbursements may not be fully received in the year the reimbursement obligation arises approximately half of the 2016 investment will be used to sustain the core infrastructure the remaining amounts will be allocated to locomotives freight cars and high return projects supporting longterm profitable growth productivity initiatives and service improvements csx intends to fund capital investments through cash generated from operations 

  

over the long term the company expects to incur significant capital costs in connection with the implementation of ptc csx estimates that the total multiyear cost of ptc implementation will be approximately  22 billion  this estimate includes costs for installing the new system along tracks upgrading locomotives adding communication equipment and developing new technologies total ptc spending through 2015 was  15 billion  

in addition to capital investments the company uses cash for scheduled payments of debt and leases share repurchases and to pay dividends to shareholders in 2015 net cash used in financing activities was 519 million  which represents a decrease in spending of 564 million  from the prior year primarily driven by higher net longterm debt issued of 904 million net of lower debt repayments partially offset by higher share repurchases of 287 million in 2014 net cash used in financing activities was 11 billion  which represents a decrease  in spending of 149 million  from 2013 this decrease was driven by higher net longterm debt issued of 347 million net of debt repayments partially offset by share repurchases of 164 million 

 36 

csx corporation 

part ii 

csx is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments csx may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors under item 1a of this form 10k 

liquidity and working capital 

currently csx is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint the company ended the year with 14 billion  of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments csx has a 1 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks this facility expires in may 2020 and as of the date of this filing the company has no outstanding balances under this facility additionally in 2015 csx issued a total of 12 billion  of new longterm debt csx uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes which may include repayment of additional indebtedness outstanding from time to time repurchases of csxs common stock capital investments working capital requirements and improvements in productivity and other cost reduction initiatives see note 9 debt and credit agreements 

the company has a receivables securitization facility with a three year term expiring in june 2017  the purpose of this facility is to provide an alternative to commercial paper and a low cost source of shortterm liquidity of up to 250 million under the terms of this facility csxt transfers eligible thirdparty receivables to csx trade receivables a bankruptcyremote special purpose subsidiary a separate subsidiary of csx services the receivables upon transfer the receivables become assets of csx trade receivables and are not available to the creditors of csx or any of its other subsidiaries in the event csx trade receivables draws under this facility the company will record an equivalent amount of debt on its consolidated financial statements as of the date of this filing the company has no outstanding balances under this facility 

working capital can also be considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its shortterm needs csx had a working capital surplus  of 1 billion  and 465 million  at december 2015  and 2014  respectively this increase since the prior year end is primarily due to the net proceeds from a debt issuance partially offset by debt repayments also see sources and uses of cash description above 

the company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above although the company currently has a surplus a working capital deficit is not unusual for csx or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity the company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due furthermore csx has sufficient financial capacity including its revolving credit facility trade receivable facility and shelf registration statement to manage its daytoday cash requirements and any anticipated obligations the company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity 

credit ratings 

credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” and moody’s investors service “moody’s” use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa for sp and moody’s respectively a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 

 37 

csx corporation

the cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by csxs longterm credit ratings csxs credit ratings remained stable during 2015 as of december 2014  and december 2015  sps longterm rating on csx was bbb stable and moodys was baa1 stable ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sp and moody’s respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade if csxs credit ratings were to decline to below investment grade levels the company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt in addition a decline in csx’s credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market’s demand and thus the company’s ability to readily issue new debt 

schedule of contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following tables set forth maturities of the companys contractual obligations and other significant commitments

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results may differ from those estimates these estimates and assumptions are discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors on a regular basis consistent with the prior year significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas 

 

casualty environmental and legal reserves 

  casualty 

casualty reserves of 265 million   and   269 million  for 2014  and 2015  respectively represent accruals for personal injury asbestos and occupational injury claims the companys selfinsured retention amount for these claims is 50 million  per occurrence currently no individual claim is expected to exceed the selfinsured retention amount in accordance with the contingencies topic  in the asc to the extent the value of an individual claim exceeds the selfinsured retention amount the company would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries these reserves fluctuate based upon the timing of payments as well as changes in estimate actual results may vary from estimates due to the number type and severity of the injury costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation most of the companys casualty claims relate to csxt unless otherwise noted below defense and processing costs which historically have been insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future are not included in the recorded liabilities during 2015 2014 and 2013 there were no  significant changes in estimate recorded to adjust casualty reserves 

personal injury 

personal injury reserves represent liabilities for employee workrelated and thirdparty injuries workrelated injuries for csxt employees are primarily subject to fela in addition to fela liabilities employees of other current or former csx subsidiaries are covered by various state workers’ compensation laws the federal longshore and harbor workers’ compensation program or the maritime jones act 

csxt retains an independent actuary to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims an analysis is performed by the actuary quarterly and is reviewed by management the methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims it is based largely on csxts historical claims and settlement experience 

asbestos  occupational 

the company is party to a number of asbestos claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the workplace the greatest possible exposure for employees resulted from work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines that were largely phased out beginning around the 1950s other types of exposures however including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials continued until these exposures were substantially eliminated by 1985 additionally the company has retained liability for asbestos claims filed against its previously owned international container shipping business diseases associated with asbestos typically have long latency periods amount of time between exposure to asbestos and the onset of the disease which can range from 10  to 40  years after exposure

m anagement reviews asserted asbestos claims quarterly since exposure to asbestos has been substantially eliminated unasserted or incurred but not reported ibnr asbestos claims are analyzed by a thirdparty specialist and reviewed by management annually in 2014 management extended the forecast period from seven years to ten years based on a review of historical settlement trends management concluded that ten years is the most probable time period in which unasserted asbestos claim filings and claim values can be estimated the company does not believe there is sufficient data to justify a projection period longer than ten years at this time the change in the forecast period resulted in an immaterial increase in the asbestos reserves during 2014 approximately 20 of the recorded undiscounted liability is related to asserted claims and approximately 80 is related to unasserted claims as of december 25 2015 

csxt’s historical claim filings settlement amounts and dismissal rates are analyzed to determine future anticipated claim filing rates and average settlement values for asbestos claims reserves the potentially exposed population is estimated by using csxt’s employment records and industry data from this analysis the specialist estimates the ibnr claims liabilities 

the estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for these reserves a 1 increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of asbestos ibnr claims or the average claim values would result in approximately a 1 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted asbestos claims 

occupational claims arise from allegations of exposure to certain materials in the workplace such as solvents soaps chemicals collectively referred to as “irritants” and diesel fuels like exhaust fumes or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions such as repetitive stress injuries carpal tunnel syndrome and hearing loss 

environmental 

environmental reserves were 94 million  and 82 million  for 2014  and 2015  respectively the company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 242  environmentally impaired sites many of these are or may be subject to remedial action under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 cercla also known as the superfund law or similar state statutes most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations a number of these proceedings however are based on allegations that the company or its predecessors sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment recycling or disposal in addition some of the company’s land holdings were leased to others for commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the company 

in any such proceedings the company is subject to environmental cleanup and enforcement actions under the superfund law as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct these costs could be substantial

critical accounting estimates  continued 

in accordance with the asset retirement and environmental obligations topic  in the asc the company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least quarterly giving consideration to a number of factors such as 

 

based on the review process the company has recorded amounts to cover contingent anticipated future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are estimable and probable the recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted the liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated insurance recoveries payments related to these liabilities are expected to be made over the next several years environmental remediation costs are included in materials supplies and other on the consolidated income statement 

currently the company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities if any on some sites until completion of future environmental studies in addition conditions that are currently unknown could at any given location result in additional exposure the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated based upon information currently available however the company believes its environmental reserves accurately reflect the cost of remedial actions currently required 

legal 

in accordance with the contingencies topic  in the asc an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated if no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred 

the company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above the amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings newly discovered or developed evidence or changes in laws regulations and evidentiary standards see item 3 legal proceedings for further discussion of these items 

pension and postretirement medical plan accounting 

the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried management personnel for employees hired prior to january 1 2003 the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement for employees hired in 2003 or thereafter benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age service and compensation   as of december 2015  the projected benefit obligation for the company’s pension plans and other postemployment benefit plans were 3 billion  and 314 million  respectively no  significant contributions to the companys qualified pension plans are expected in 2016  

 41 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates  continued 

in addition to these plans the company sponsors a postretirement medical plan and a life insurance plan that provide benefits to fulltime salaried management employees hired prior to january 1 2003 upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met eligible retirees who are age 65 years or older medicareeligible are covered by a health reimbursement arrangement which is an employerfunded account that can be used for reimbursement of eligible medical expenses eligible retirees younger than 65 years nonmedicare eligible are covered by a selfinsured program partially funded by participating retirees the life insurance plan is noncontributory 

for information related to the funded status of the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans see note 8 employee benefit plans 

the accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the compensationretirement benefits topic  in the asc this rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following 

 

the company engages independent actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the company selects these amounts are reviewed by management 

discount rates 

discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component of pension and postretirement expense discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other postretirement benefits could be effectively settled or in other words how much it would cost the company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the companys expected future benefit payments the company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans expected benefit payments 

the discount rates used by the company to value its 2015  pension and postretirement obligations are 430  and 385  respectively for 2014  the discount rate used by the company to value its pension and postretirement obligations was 400  and 360  respectively discount rates may differ for pension and postretirement benefits due to varying duration of the liabilities for projected payments for each plan as of december 2015  the estimated duration of pensions and postretirement benefits is approximately 12  years and 8  years respectively 

each year these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates in general if interest rates decline or rise the assumed discount rates will change

critical accounting estimates  continued 

longterm rate of return on plan assets 

the expected longterm average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation in estimating that rate the company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected longterm rate of return on assets as this assumption is longterm the annual review may result in less frequent adjustment than other assumptions used in pension accounting the longterm rate of return on plan assets used by the company to value its pension obligation was 700  and 725  in 2015  and 2014  respectively 

salary scale inflation rates 

salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the company the company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates the company used a salary scale rate of 460  and 410  in 2015  and 2014  respectively to value its pension obligations 

other assumptions 

the calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to health care cost trend rates mortality rates turnover and retirement age these assumptions are based upon historical data recent plan experience and industry trends and are selected by management 

2016  estimated pension and postretirement expense 

net pension and postretirement benefits expense for 2016  is expected to be approximately 58 million   and 16 million  respectively compared to 69 million  and 17 million  respectively in 2015  the decrease in expense is largely related to the impact of higher discount rates and historically favorable pension asset experience 

the following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effect of changes in certain assumptions like discount rates longterm rate of return and salaries on the 2015  estimated pension and postretirement expense 



depreciation policies for assets utilizing the grouplife method 

the company depreciates its rail assets including mainline track locomotives and freight cars using the grouplife method of accounting assets depreciated under the grouplife method comprise 86  of total fixed assets of 42 billion  on a gross basis at december 2015  all other assets of the company are depreciated on a straightline basis the grouplife method aggregates assets with similar lives and characteristics into groups and depreciates each of these groups as a whole when using the grouplife method an underlying assumption is that each group of assets as a whole is used and depreciated to the end of its recoverable life 

 43 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates  continued   

the company currently utilizes more than 130  different depreciable asset categories to account for depreciation expense for the railroad assets that are depreciated under the grouplife method of accounting examples of depreciable asset categories include 18  different categories for crossties due to the different combinations of density classifications and asset types by utilizing various depreciable categories the company can more accurately account for the use of its assets all assets of the company are depreciated on a time or life basis 

the company believes the grouplife method of depreciation closely approximates the straightline method of depreciation additionally due to the nature of most of its assets eg track is one contiguous connected asset the company believes that this is the most effective way to properly depreciate its assets 

under the grouplife method of accounting the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying managements assumptions regarding the service lives of its properties a depreciation study also referred to as a life study is the periodic review of asset service lives salvage values accumulated depreciation and other related factors for group assets conducted by a thirdparty specialist analyzed by the company’s management and approved by the stb the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices the stb requires depreciation studies be performed for equipment assets generally every three  years and for road eg bridges and signals and track eg rail ties and ballast assets generally every six  years the company believes the frequency currently required by the stb provides adequate review of asset service lives and that a more frequent review would not result in a material change due to the longlived nature of most of the assets in 2014 the company completed a depreciation study for its road and track assets in 2012 the company completed a depreciation study for its equipment assets and a technical update an update to the prior depreciation study for its road and track assets the company plans to complete the next depreciation study for road and track assets in 2020 and for equipment assets in 2016 

changes in asset service lives due to the results of the depreciation studies are applied on a prospective basis and could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense and thus the companys results of operations 

there are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include

critical accounting estimates  continued 

for retirements or disposals of depreciable rail assets that occur in the ordinary course of business the asset cost net of salvage value or sales proceeds is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized as individual assets within a specific group are retired resulting gains and losses are recorded in accumulated depreciation this practice is consistent with accounting treatment normally prescribed under the grouplife method as part of the depreciation study an assessment of the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is made to determine if it is deficient or in excess of the appropriate amount indicated by the study any such deficiency or excess including any deferred gains or losses is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service life of the asset group until the next required depreciation study since the overall assumption with grouplife is that the assets within the group on average have the same service life and characteristics it is therefore concluded that the deferred gains and losses offset over time 

in the event that large groups of assets are removed from service as a result of unusual acts or sales resulting gains and losses are recognized immediately these acts are not considered to be in the normal course of business and are therefore recognized when incurred examples of such acts would be the major destruction of assets due to significant storm damage eg major hurricanes the sale of a rail line segment to another railroad or the disposal of an entire class of assets eg disposal of all refrigerated freight cars 

recent experience with depreciation studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes which did not materially affect the company’s annual depreciation expense of 12 billion  12 billion  and 11 billion  for 2015  2014  and 2013 respectively a 1  change in the average life of all grouplife assets would result in an approximate 11 million  change to the company’s annual depreciation expense 

income taxes 

csx accounts for income taxes in accordance with the income taxes topic  in the asc that addresses how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under this topic the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the amount recognized in the financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent  likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 

csx files a consolidated federal income tax return which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries examinations of the federal income tax returns of csx have been completed through 2014  during 2015  the company participated in a contemporaneous internal revenue service “irs” audit of tax year 2015  management believes an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed while the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty it is the opinion of csx management that none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition results of operations or liquidity of csx an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items however could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year as of december 2015  the company’s uncertain tax positions were 23 million

financial information 

see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for operating revenue operating income and total assets for each of the last three fiscal years 

  

company history 

a leader in freight rail transportation for more than 185 years the company’s heritage dates back to the early nineteenth century when the baltimore and ohio railroad company “bo” – the nation’s first common carrier – was chartered in 1827 since that time the company has built on this foundation to create a railroad that could safely and reliably service the everincreasing demands of a growing nation 

  

since its founding numerous railroads have combined with the former bo through merger and consolidation to create what has become csx each of the railroads that combined into the csx family brought new geographical reach to valuable markets gateways cities ports and transportation corridors 

  

csx was incorporated in 1978 under virginia law in 1980 the company completed the merger of the chessie system and seaboard coast line industries into csx the merger allowed the company to connect northern population centers and appalachian coal fields to growing southeastern markets later the company’s acquisition of key portions of conrail inc conrail allowed csxt to link the northeast including new england and the new york metropolitan area with chicago and midwestern markets as well as the growing areas in the southeast already served by csxt this current rail network allows the company to directly serve every major market in the eastern united states with safe dependable environmentally responsible and fuel efficient freight transportation and intermodal service 

  

competition 

the business environment in which the company operates is highly competitive shippers typically select transportation providers that offer the most compelling combination of service and price service requirements both in terms of transit time and reliability vary by shipper and commodity as a result the company’s primary competition varies by commodity geographic location and mode of available transportation

csx corporation 

part i 

csxt’s primary rail competitor is norfolk southern railway which operates throughout much of the company’s territory other railroads also operate in parts of the company’s territory depending on the specific market competing railroads and deregulated motor carriers may exert pressure on price and service levels for further discussion on the risk of competition to the company see item 1a risk factors 

  

regulatory environment 

the companys operations are subject to various federal state provincial canada and local laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses operating in the united states and canada in the us the railroad operations conducted by the companys subsidiaries including csxt are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the surface transportation board “stb” the federal railroad administration “fra” and its sister agency within the us department of transportation the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration “phmsa” together fra and phmsa have broad jurisdiction over railroad operating standards and practices including track freight cars locomotives and hazardous materials requirements in addition the us environmental protection agency “epa” has regulatory authority with respect to matters that impact the companys properties and operations the epa is considering regulatory action directed towards the railroad industry governing the disposal of creosote crossties and seeking to increase air emission regulations that may impact our operations or increase costs similarly the transportation security administration “tsa” a component of the department of homeland security has broad authority over railroad operating practices that may have homeland security implications in canada the railroad operations conducted by the company’s subsidiaries including csxt are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the canadian transportation agency 

    

although the staggers act of 1980 significantly deregulated the us rail industry the stb has broad jurisdiction over rail carriers the stb regulates routes fuel surcharges conditions of service rates for nonexempt traffic acquisitions of control over rail common carriers and the transfer extension or abandonment of rail lines among other railroad activities 

positive train control 

in 2008 congress enacted the rail safety improvement act the “rsia” the legislation includes a mandate that all class i freight railroads implement an interoperable positive train control system “ptc” by december 31 2015 implementation of a ptc system is designed to prevent traintotrain collisions overspeed derailments incursions into established workzone limits and train diversions onto another set of tracks in 2012 the association of american railroads aar advised the fra on behalf of the industry that a nationwide interoperable ptc network could not be completed by the deadline in 2012 the fra revised its final rule on the design operational requirements and implementation of ptc technology and is now reexamining certain additional aspects of the rule in response to rail industry concerns in 2012 the fra filed a report with congress stating that it also believed that the majority of railroads would not be able to complete ptc implementation by the 2015 deadline and recommending that congress amend the rsia to allow the fra to grant conditional extensions of the 2015 deadline as of the date of this filing congress has taken no action to extend the statutory deadline 

ptc must be installed on all main lines with passenger and commuter operations as well as most of those over which toxicbyinhalation hazardous materials are transported the company expects to incur significant capital costs in connection with the implementation of ptc as well as related ongoing operating expenses csx currently estimates that the total multiyear cost of ptc implementation will be at least 19 billion  for the company total ptc spending through 2014  was  12 billion

stb proceedings 

in 2012 the stb announced it would accept comments on a proposal by the national industrial transportation league that would require class i railroads to provide a form of competitive access to customers served solely by one railroad under this proposal csx would be required to allow a competing railroad to access certain customers that are currently solely served by csxs network in early 2013 shippers railroads and other parties submitted comments on the proposal and the stb held a hearing in march 2014 since the hearing the stb has taken no further action in the proceeding  

in july 2013 the stb released a decision that raised the limitations on the monetary recovery that a shipper may obtain when bringing a simplified rate reasonableness case csx and norfolk southern filed a joint appeal to the dc circuit in august 2014 the dc circuit upheld the stb’s decision to raise the limitations in simplified rate reasonableness cases 

in april 2014 the stb announced it would receive comments to explore its methodology for determining railroad revenue adequacy the revenue adequacy standard represents the level of profitability for a healthy carrier shippers railroads and other parties filed opening comments in september 2014 and filed reply comments in november 2014 

new rules regarding competitive access or revenue adequacy could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations and liquidity as well as its ability to invest in enhancing and maintaining vital infrastructure for further discussion on regulatory risks to the company see item 1a risk factors

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the companys forwardlooking statements additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the company or that the company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

new legislation or regulatory changes could impact the companys earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices 

legislation passed by congress or new regulations issued by federal agencies can significantly affect the revenues costs and profitability of the companys business for instance several of the proposals under consideration by the stb could have a significant negative impact on the companys ability to negotiate prices for the value of rail services provided and meet service standards which could force a reduction in capital spending in addition statutes imposing price constraints or affecting railtorail competition could adversely affect the companys profitability 

  

government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the companys operations and financial results 

the company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies including the stb fra phmsa tsa epa and other state provincial and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic health safety labor environmental tax legal and other matters new rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the companys operating costs or reduce operating efficiencies for example the rsia mandated that the installation of ptc be completed by december 31 2015 on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that have commuter or passenger operations noncompliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the company and can subject the company to fines penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions 

  

climate change and other emissionsrelated legislation and regulation could adversely affect the companys operations and financial results 

climate change and other emissionsrelated legislation and regulation have been proposed and in some cases adopted on the federal state provincial and local levels these final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions caps taxes or other controls on emissions in particular the epa has issued various regulations and is expected to issue additional regulations targeting emissions including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles 

any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations could adversely affect the companys operations and financial results by among other things i reducing coalfired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards ii reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the united states iii increasing the companys fuel capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies and iv making it difficult for the companys customers in the us and canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner particularly in the absence of similar regulations in other manufacturing countries any of these factors could reduce the amount of shipments the company handles and have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

capacity constraints could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency 

csxt may experience rail network difficulties related to i increased volume ii locomotive or crew shortages iii extreme weather conditions iv increased passenger activities including highspeed rail or v regulatory changes impacting when   csxt can transport freight or maintain routes which could have a negative effect on csxts operational fluidity leading to deterioration of service asset utilization and overall efficiency

part i 

global economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight 

a decline or disruption in general domestic and global economic conditions that affects demand for the commodities and products the company transports including import and export volume could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects on the companys cost structure for example if the rate of economic growth in asia slows or if european economies contract us export coal volume could be adversely impacted resulting in lower revenue for csx if the company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products the company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs associated with the storage of locomotives railcars and other equipment workforce adjustments and other related activities which could have a material adverse effect on operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

changing dynamics in the us and global energy markets could negatively impact profitability 

domestic energy production continues to evolve creating both opportunities and challenges for csx increased production of crude oil from the new domestic oil fields particularly those located in the bakken shale region of north dakota has created opportunities for csx to transport crude oil by rail to east coast refineries crude oil production from this region is subject to the volatility of global crude oil prices depressed crude oil prices due to increased supply or lower demand could result in a decrease in domestic crude oil production which could have an adverse effect on crude oil volumes for csx in addition new regulations related to the shipment of crude oil by rail including proposed rail car safety standards could increase costs for csx negatively impact network fluidity or have an adverse impact on customers 

over the past few years production of natural gas in the us has also increased dramatically which has resulted in lower natural gas prices as a result of sustained low natural gas prices coalfired power plants have been displaced by natural gasfired power generation facilities if natural gas prices were to remain low additional coalfired plants could be displaced which could further reduce the companys domestic coal volumes and revenues 

csxt as a common carrier by rail is required by law to transport hazardous materials which could expose the company to significant costs and claims 

a train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury property or natural resource damage environmental penalties and remediation obligations such claims if insured could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates under federal regulations csxt is required to transport hazardous materials under the legal duty referred to as the common carrier mandate 

csxt is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials in november 2008 the tsa issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail noncompliance with these rules can subject the company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident finally legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances which could increase operating costs reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials

the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs 

the company is subject to wideranging federal state provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions into the air ground and water the handling storage use generation transportation and disposal of waste and other materials the cleanup of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees if the company violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations csx could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators the company can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which csx is responsible in certain circumstances environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties leased properties adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or company predecessors as well as to properties currently owned leased or used by the company 

  

the company has been and may in the future be subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated or is strictly liable under environmental laws or regulations and such violations can result in the companys incurring fines penalties or costs relating to the cleanup of environmental contamination although the company believes it has appropriately recorded current and longterm liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing the company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination 

  

the company relies on the stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business 

the company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business the performance and reliability of the companys technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively    a cybersecurity attack which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems or other significant disruption or failure could result in a service interruption train accident misappropriation of confidential information process failure security breach or other operational difficulties such an event could result in increased capital insurance or operating costs including increased security costs to protect the companys infrastructure a disruption or compromise of the companys information technology systems even for short periods of time could have a material adverse effect on the company 

disruption of the supply chain could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs 

the capital intensive nature and sophistication of core rail equipment including rolling stock equipment locomotives rail and ties limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers if any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage csxt could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage in addition a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and as such adverse developments in international relations new trade regulations disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase csxts operating costs additionally if a fuel supply shortage were to arise whether due to production restrictions lower refinery outputs a disruption of oil imports adverse political developments or otherwise the company would be negatively impacted

failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes andor work stoppages 

    most of csxs employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements most of these agreements are bargained for nationally by the national carriers conference committee and negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages under the railway labor acts procedures which include mediation coolingoff periods and the possibility of presidential intervention during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted if however csx is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements or if terms of existing agreements are disputed the employees covered by the railway labor act could strike which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members 

the company faces competition from other transportation providers 

the company experiences competition in pricing service reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and to a less significant extent barges ships and pipelines other transportation providers generally use public rightsofway that are built and maintained by governmental entities while csxt and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks could negatively impact the companys competitive position 

  

future acts of terrorism war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the companys operations 

terrorist attacks along with any government response to those attacks may adversely affect the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity csxts rail lines or other key infrastructure may be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war this risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues in addition premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the company could increase dramatically or the coverage may no longer be available 

  

furthermore in response to the heightened risk of terrorism federal state and local governmental bodies are proposing and in some cases have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry for example the department of homeland security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials complying with these or future regulations could continue to increase the companys operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies 

severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage 

the companys operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences including floods fires hurricanes and earthquakes as a result the companys rail network may be damaged its workforce may be unavailable fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur in addition the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions insurance maintained by the company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations depending on the nature of the risk insured this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the companys damages or damages to others and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates even with insurance if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service the company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations

the company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures 

as part of its railroad operations the company is subject to various claims and lawsuits related to disputes over commercial practices labor and unemployment matters occupational and personal injury claims property damage environmental and other matters the company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits although the company establishes reserves and maintains insurance to cover these types of claims final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may differ materially from the recorded reserves and exceed the companys insurance coverage additionally the company is subject to adverse developments not currently reflected in the companys reserve estimates 

the unavailability of critical resources could adversely affect the company’s operational efficiency and ability to meet demand   

marketplace conditions for resources like locomotives as well as the availability of qualified personnel particularly engineers and trainmen could each have a negative impact on the company’s ability to meet demand for rail service although the company believes that it has adequate personnel for the current business environment unpredictable increases in demand for rail services or extreme weather conditions may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on the company’s operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

weaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the company’s access to capital 

due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient railroad the company regularly relies on capital markets for the issuance of longterm debt instruments as well as on bank financing from time to time instability or disruptions of the capital markets including credit markets or the deterioration of the company’s financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit access and could increase the cost of financing sources a significant deterioration of the company’s financial condition could also reduce credit ratings and could limit or affect its access to external sources of capital and increase the costs of short and longterm debt financing

 item 2 properties 

the company’s properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure locomotives and freight cars and equipment these categories and the geography of the network are described below 

track and infrastructure 

serving 23  states the district of columbia and the canadian provinces of ontario and quebec the csxt rail network serves among other markets new york philadelphia and boston in the northeast and midatlantic the southeast markets of atlanta miami and new orleans and the midwestern cities of st louis memphis and chicago 

csxt’s track structure includes main thoroughfares connecting terminals and yards known as mainline track track within terminals and switching yards track adjacent to the mainlines used for passing trains track connecting the mainline track to customer locations and track that diverts trains from one track to another known as turnouts total track miles are greater than csxt’s approximately 21000  route miles which reflect the size of csxt’s network that connects markets customers and western railroads at december 2014  the breakdown of track miles was as follows 



in addition to its physical track structure csxt operates numerous yards and terminals these serve as hubs between csxt and its local customers and as sorting facilities where railcars often are received resorted and placed onto new outbound trains the company’s ten largest yards and terminals based on annual volume number of railcars or intermodal containers processed are listed below

network geography 

csxt’s operations are primarily focused on four major transportation networks and corridors which are defined geographically and by commodity flows below 

interstate 90 i90 corridor  – this csxt corridor links chicago and the midwest to metropolitan areas in new york and new england this route also known as the “waterlevel route” has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks referred to as double track these superior engineering attributes permit the corridor to support consistent highspeed intermodal automotive and merchandise service this corridor is a primary route for import traffic coming from the far east through western ports moving eastward across the country through chicago and into the population centers in the northeast the i90 corridor is also a critical link between ports in new york new jersey and pennsylvania and consumption markets in the midwest this route carries consumer goods from all three of the company’s major markets – merchandise coal and intermodal 

interstate 95 i95 corridor  – the csxt i95 corridor connects charleston jacksonville miami and many other cities throughout the southeast with the heavily populated midatlantic and northeastern cities of baltimore philadelphia and new york csxt primarily transports food and consumer products as well as metals and chemicals along this line it is the only rail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of the district of columbia and provides access to major eastern ports 

southeastern corridor  – this critical part of the network runs between csxt’s western gateways of chicago st louis and memphis through the cities of nashville birmingham and atlanta and markets in the southeast the southeastern corridor is the premier rail route connecting these key cities gateways and markets and positions csxt to efficiently handle projected traffic volumes of intermodal automotive and general merchandise traffic the corridor also provides direct rail service between the coal reserves of the southern illinois basin and the demand for coal in the southeast 

coal network   – the csxt coal network connects the coal mining operations in the appalachian mountain region and illinois basin with industrial areas in the northeast and midatlantic as well as many river lake and deep water port facilities csxt’s coal network is well positioned to supply utility markets in both the northeast and southeast and to transport coal shipments for export outside of the us almost half  the tons of export coal and nearly all  of the domestic coal that the company transports is used for generating electricity

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

strategic overview 

csx provides railbased freight transportation services including traditional rail service the transport of intermodal containers and trailers as well as other transportation services such as railtotruck transfers and bulk commodity operations with its approximately 32000  dedicated employees the company and the rail industry provide customers with access to an expansive and interconnected transportation network that plays a key role in north american commerce and is critical to the economic success and improved global competitiveness of the united states this improved competitiveness is driven by lower natural gas prices increased foreign labor costs and supply chain factors 

the rail industry benefits from this improved global competitiveness continued economic growth and the shift towards more railbased solutions us demand to move more goods by rail is expected to rise and freight railroads provide the most environmentally efficient and economical means to meet this growing demand csx can move a ton of freight about 450 miles on one gallon of diesel fuel as trains are four times more fuel efficient than trucks on average shipping freight by rail also alleviates highway congestion eases air pollution and saves energy 

csxs network reaches nearly twothirds of the us population which accounts for the majority of the nations consumption of goods through this network the company transports a diverse portfolio of commodities and products to meet the countrys needs these products range from agricultural goods such as grains to chemicals automobiles metals building materials paper consumer products and energy sources like coal ethanol and crude oil the company categorizes these products into three primary lines of business merchandise intermodal and coal csxs transportation solutions connect industries and population centers across the united states with each other and with global markets through access to over 70 port facilities whereby meeting the transportation needs of energy producers manufacturers industrial producers construction companies farmers and feed mills wholesalers and retailers and the united states armed forces 

operating initiatives 

to support longterm growth csx is focused on meeting customers’ needs while improving profitability several key operating initiatives have been implemented over the past several years that lay a foundation for meeting these objectives the overall goal is sustained high customer service levels which is in part achieved through a relentless focus on using advanced network modeling analytics and tools to create a disciplined scheduled approach to designing and running csxs network the company continues to identify the most efficient costeffective routes for csxt customers traffic while providing timely service with the fewest handlings and car miles possible 

through the service excellence initiative csx is building a culture that engages all employees and focuses on the value delivered to customers through improved service this initiative increases employee communication and dialogue to help identify and resolve customer issues at the lowest level improving the customer experience and allowing csx to grow the business this process involves engagement from all operating employees as well as collaboration with sales and marketing employees and ultimately with the company’s customers higher levels of customer service and satisfaction support csx’s ability to profitably grow the business by increasing customer retention price sustainability and asset utilization 

 22 

csx corporation

in addition total service integration “tsi” is intended to align operating capabilities with customers needs to reduce loading and unloading times and create more capacity tsi was first implemented on the unit train network where it has successfully increased the average number of cars per train and improved asset utilization csx is implementing tsi for the carload network which focuses on improving the “first and last mile” service experience for carload customers providing a more consistent and reliable service product the carload network is connected to more than 5000 customer facilities and has a high degree of variability each day new tools and technology are allowing the company to more effectively communicate with customers not only providing the service the company has promised to deliver but proactively notifying the customer of service status applying tsi to the carload network will improve service consistency for each merchandise shipper 

finally enterprise asset management “eam” focuses on improving the utilization of the company’s most critical assets namely crews locomotives cars and track infrastructure projects are currently in place to deploy technology improve processes and reduce unproductive time because the railroad is an asset intensive industry eam helps reduce the overall expense associated with asset ownership by monitoring the overall condition of equipment helping proactively schedule maintenance increasing utilization and also effectively managing the investment required for new or replacement assets by improving asset utilization csx expects to sustain longterm operating efficiencies and reduce future capital expenditures associated with asset replacement 

in summary these initiatives are designed to improve service levels in a cost effective manner and enhance the reliability of rail transportation these improvements to operational processes customer communication and service are better aligning csxs operating capabilities with customers needs and are enabling the company to capitalize on the growth opportunities described below 

strategic growth opportunities 

intermodal 

csx’s intermodal business is an economical and environmentally friendly alternative to transporting freight on highways via truck csx’s intermodal network connects all major population centers east of the mississippi river and is over 90 cleared for the use of doublestack two containers high intermodal movements this positions the company to capture a significant share of the incremental domestic intermodal market opportunity estimated at nine million truckloads in the eastern united states that move over 550 miles the company’s highwaytorail initiatives assist in capturing this traffic and also help customers identify conversion opportunities for both domestic moves and the us portion of international moves 

csx is also building new terminals and increasing network capacity to broaden its market presence in key growth areas the companys northwest ohio intermodal terminal which started operations in 2011 and was expanded in 2014 is part of the national gateway initiative discussed below this highcapacity terminal expands service offerings to customers improves market access to and from east coast ports reduces interchanges in chicago and enhances the fluidity of the network during 2014 the company opened terminals in winter haven fl and quebec canada the company expects to begin construction on a new terminal near pittsburgh pa in 2015 enhancing the company’s intermodal reach and supporting future growth

illinois basin coal shift 

energy markets have shifted over the past few years and continue to evolve in spite of declines in domestic utility coal consumption over the last few years csx coal volumes have recently grown as a result of colder winter weather in the longer term downward pressure on domestic coal volumes could resume as the result of increasingly stringent proposed environmental regulations and continued low natural gas prices in addition mining economics are causing a shift from central appalachian coal to thermal coal in the illinois basin and the powder river basin to capitalize on these shifts csx continues to enhance its network to support these changes such as adding sidings track which enables trains on the same line to pass and increasing yard capacity 

export coal 

csx export coal volume and pricing is subject to a high degree of volatility as a result of changes in the global economy competition from foreign coal producers and regulatory shifts over the past few years csx has capitalized on the global coal demand in both steel manufacturing and power generation currently both global thermal and metallurgical coal prices are low due to oversupply but csx sees longterm growth in global demand as developing countries become more urbanized the company remains opportunistic based on the global markets and the resulting level of demand in addition to the company’s ready access to large us coal suppliers and multiple port facilities csx expects to continue to enhance the operating efficiency of its export coal network which will favorably position the company to capitalize on growth as it is made available 

new energy markets 

the ongoing surge in shale drilling for the extraction of oil and natural gas has created the opportunity for csx to serve new energy markets such as crude oil liquefied petroleum gases “lpg” frac sand and other related materials for example csx is capitalizing on the opportunity to move the growing supply of crude oil from the new domestic oil fields particularly those located in the bakken shale region of north dakota to customers at eastern refineries this service also provides greater flexibility in source locations as compared to pipelines 

csx’s lpg market is also benefiting from drilling in ohio pennsylvania and west virginia within the utica shale region midstream energy companies which are involved in the transportation storage and wholesale of refined petroleum products are taking advantage of the abundance of inexpensive wet gas with newly constructed gas processing plants or “fractionators” in the region rail will also play a vital role in moving lpg products from the fractionators to the market 

csx’s frac sand market a key input in the drilling process has also expanded rapidly over the last few years the company has invested in new operating capacity such as railcars and terminals to accommodate this growth which has been concentrated mainly in the region of the utica shale and the western marcellus shale which covers most of western pennsylvania and northern west virginia the csx network not only provides access to many frac sand transload terminals located near the drilling activity but also offers the advantage of csxdirect routes from several key sand producing regions to the frac sand terminals 

over the longer term the improved energy supply outlook for the us will create a sustainable competitive advantage for domestic chemical producers and generate additional growth opportunities for rail since natural gas is the primary component in the production of a wide range of petrochemicals the supply growth and the resulting lower prices have now placed the us amongst the lowest cost production regions in the world this increased competitiveness is sparking significant investment in new us chemical industry capacity for the first time in more than a decade csx is wellpositioned to participate in this growing chemical business over the next several years

publicprivate partnerships 

expanding capacity on us rail networks provides substantial public benefits including job creation increased business activity at us ports reduced highway congestion and lower air emissions therefore csx and its government partners are jointly working to invest in multiyear rail infrastructure projects such as the national gateway this initiative is a publicprivate partnership which will increase intermodal capacity and create substantial environmental and efficiency advantages by clearing key corridors between midatlantic ports and the midwest for doublestack intermodal trains 

as part of the national gateway project csx expects to break ground on the modernization of the virginia avenue tunnel in washington dc in 2015this project will improve the flow of freight traffic through the district of columbia and will eliminate a railtraffic bottleneck that also impacts commuter and passenger trains in the region the new structure will provide doublestack train clearances in maryland west virginia and the district of columbia going forward csx will continue to explore other opportunities to partner with the public sector to maximize the many public benefits of freight rail 

balanced approach to cash deployment 

csx remains highly committed to delivering value to shareholders through a balanced approach to deploying cash that includes investments in the business dividend growth and share repurchases in 2014 the company invested 24 billion  to further enhance the capacity quality safety and flexibility of its network in addition csx continues to return value to its shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases during 2014 the company announced a 7 percent increase in the quarterly cash dividend to 016 per common share the company has increased its quarterly cash dividend 12 times over the last nine years which represents a 27 percent compounded annual growth rate also in 2014 csx continued share repurchases under its 1 billion program which began in 2013 and is expected to be completed in 2015 based on market and business decisions csx repurchased 517 million  or 17 million shares during 2014 under this program since 2006 csx has repurchased 493 million shares adjusted for stock splits for 88 billion which represents about onehalf of total shares outstanding as part of this balanced approach the company is committed to maintaining a credit profile consistent with a bbb rating by standard  poor’s and a baa1 rating by moody’s investment services 

summary 

these operating initiatives strategic growth areas longterm investments and shareholder returns discussed above provide a foundation for volume growth productivity improvement enhanced customer service and continued advancements in the safety and reliability of operations to continue these types of investments the company must be able to operate in an environment in which it can generate adequate returns and drive shareholder value csx will continue to advocate for a fair and balanced regulatory environment to ensure that the value of the companys rail service would be reflected in any potential new legislation or policies

export declines were driven by decreased shipments of us thermal coal as a result of global oversupply and lower coal prices shipments of domestic coal declined due to continued low natural gas prices and utility stockpiles above target levels 

intermodal 

domestic volume growth was driven by continued success with highwaytorail conversions growth with existing customers and service product enhancements international volume increased due to strength with existing customers and the cycling of disruptions resulting from hurricane sandy in the prior year 

other 

other revenue increased primarily due to higher revenue from customers who did not meet minimum contractual volumes 

expenses 

in 2013 total expenses increased 254 million or 3 compared to prior year descriptions of each expense category as well as significant yearoveryear changes are described below 

  

labor and fringe  expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes health and welfare costs pension other postretirement benefits and incentive compensation these expenses increased 118 million primarily due to the following items 

 

materials supplies and other   expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment and for terminal services at automotive facilities as well as professional services this category also includes costs related to materials travel casualty claims environmental remediation train accidents property and sales tax utilities and other items total materials supplies and other expense increased 119 million primarily driven by the following

fuel  expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as nonlocomotive fuel this expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel fuel expense decreased 16 million driven by the following 

 

depreciation  expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of a capital asset such as locomotives railcars and track structure over its useful life this expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year depreciation expense increased 45 million primarily due to a larger asset base related to higher capital spending 

equipment and other   includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies net of rents received by csxt for use of its equipment this category of expenses also includes lease expenses for locomotives railcars containers and trailers office and other rentals these expenses decreased 12 million primarily due to improved asset utilization partially offset by increased rates and volume 

interest expense  decreased 4 million to 562 million primarily due to lower average interest rates partially offset by higher average debt balances 

other income  net  decreased 62 million to 11 million primarily related to the prior year gain recognized on the sale of a nonoperating property that was not repeated in the current year 

income tax expens e decreased 50 million to 106 billion primarily due to the yearoveryear decrease in earnings before income taxes as well as federal and state legislative changes 

net earnings  increased 1 million to 186 billion and earnings per diluted share increased 004 to 183 due to the factors mentioned above lower average shares outstanding also had a positive impact on earnings per diluted share

the company measures and reports safety and service performance the company strives for continuous improvement in these measures through training innovation and investment for example the companys safety and train accident prevention programs rely on the latest tools programs and employee participation that strengthen the safety culture in a supportive environment that allows each employee to be successful at csx continued capital investment in the companys assets including track bridges signals equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance csx safety programs are designed to prevent incidents that can impact employees customers and the communities we serve 

  

the company consistently collaborates with the fra and industry organizations as well as federal state and local governments on the development and implementation of safety programs and initiatives for example earlier this year csx and other major freight railroads met with the us department of transportation dot and other key stakeholders to discuss potential safety enhancements to our nation’s freight railroad network csx as part of a wider industry initiative voluntarily committed to take specific longterm actions to increase its strong safety performance csx agreed to reduce the speed of certain trains to 40 miles per hour through high threat urban areas increase the frequency of track inspections and work collaboratively and proactively with local communities to address areaspecific concerns furthermore csx partnered with operation lifesaver inc the dot and other major railroads in the common sense campaign to reduce the number of injuries and fatalities around the railroad right of way csxt continues an ongoing public safety program to clearcut trees and vegetation at public passive highwayrail intersections crossings with no flashing lights or gates to improve the publics ability to discern rail activities

  at csx operational success is built on employee commitment to maintaining a constant focus on safety during 2014 the fra reportable personal injury frequency index worsened 6 percent  year over year to 095  the reported fra train accident frequency rate weakened 12 percent  year over year to 222  despite these results csx remains an industry leader in employee safety 

despite significant volume growth the company expects service to gradually improve to superior levels with the addition of strategic infrastructure investments locomotives and operating employees coming online ontime originations were 56 percent  and ontime arrivals were 45 percent  which are both down versus 2013 but stabilized by the end of the year year over year average train velocity declined 13 percent  to 201  miles per hour and dwell worsened 18 percent  to 263  hours 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures including those to address regulatory and legislative requirements to have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity its balance sheet sources and uses of cash flow and external factors should be reviewed 

material changes in the consolidated balance sheets and significant cash flows 

consolidated balance sheets 

csxs balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of csxs balanced approach in deploying capital for the benefit of its shareholders which includes investments in infrastructure dividend improvement and share repurchases 

total assets as well as total liabilities and shareholders equity increased   13 billion  from prior year the increase in assets was driven by higher net properties of 13 billion  resulting from planned capital investments the increase in total liabilities and shareholders equity combined was driven by net earnings of 19 billion  higher pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities of 269 million mostly driven by lower discount rates and higher deferred income taxes of 196 million primarily related to accelerated tax depreciation partially offsetting these increases were dividends paid of 629 million and share repurchases of 517 million 

significant cash flows 

the following tables present net cash provided by used in operating investing and financing activities for full years 2012 2013 and 2014

sources of cash 

the company has multiple sources of cash first the company generates cash from operations and in 2014  the company generated 33 billion  of cash from operating activities which was 76 million  higher than the prior year primarily driven by higher net earnings in 2013 the company generated 33 billion of cash from operating activities which increased 321 million from 2012 primarily driven by a 275 million contribution to the companys qualified pension plans in 2012 that did not repeat 

second csx has access to numerous financing sources including a 1 billion fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in september 2016 as of the date of this filing the company has no outstanding balances under this facility see note 9 debt and credit agreements for more information 

csx filed a shelf registration statement with the sec on february 15 2013 this shelf registration statement is unlimited as to amount and may be used to issue debt or equity securities at csx’s discretion subject to market conditions and csx board authorization while csx seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit csx to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time or at all 

uses of cash 

csx continued to invest in its business to create longterm value for shareholders in 2014  net cash used in investing activities was 22 billion  a decrease in spending of 44 million  from the prior year primarily driven by higher net sales of shortterm investments in 2013 net cash used in investing activities was 22 billion a decrease in spending of 50 million from 2012 primarily driven by higher net sales of shortterm investments partially offset by lower proceeds from property dispositions 

the company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for longterm growth through expanding network and terminal capacity funds used for property additions are further described below

planned capital investments for 2015 are expected to be 25 billion  including expected spending of approximately 300 million  for ptc this 25 billion  excludes investments related to partially or wholly reimbursable publicprivate partnerships where reimbursements may not be fully received in a given year approximately half of the 2015 investment will be used to sustain the core infrastructure the remaining amounts will be allocated to locomotives freight cars and high return projects supporting longterm profitable growth productivity initiatives and service improvements to optimize performance csx intends to fund capital investments through cash generated from operations 

  

over the long term the company expects to incur significant capital costs in connection with the implementation of ptc csx estimates that the total multiyear cost of ptc implementation will be at least  19 billion  this estimate includes costs for installing the new system along tracks upgrading locomotives adding communication equipment and developing new technologies total ptc spending through 2014 was  12 billion  

in addition to capital investments the company uses cash for scheduled payments of debt and leases share repurchases and to pay dividends to shareholders in 2014 net cash used in financing activities was 11 billion  which represents a decrease  in spending of 149 million  this decrease was driven by higher net longterm debt issued of 347 million net of debt repayments partially offset by share repurchases of 164 million in 2013 net cash used in financing activities was 12 million which was an increase in spending of 564 million driven by higher debt repayments and a lower amount of debt issued partially offset by lower share repurchases 

csx is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments csx may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors under item 1a of this form 10k 

liquidity and working capital 

currently csx is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint the company ended the year with 961 million  of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments csx has a 1 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks this facility expires in september 2016  and as of the date of this filing the company has no outstanding balances under this facility additionally in 2014 csx issued a total of 1 billion  of new longterm debt csx uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes which may include reduction or refinancing of outstanding indebtedness capital expenditures working capital requirements contributions to the companys qualified pension plan redemptions and repurchases of csx common stock and dividends to shareholders see note 9 debt and credit agreements 

the companys 250 million receivables securitization facility has a three year term and expires in june 2017  the purpose of this facility is to provide an alternative to commercial paper and a low cost source of shortterm liquidity the company anticipates either renewing the facility or replacing it with another liquiditybased solution under the terms of this facility csxt transfers eligible thirdparty receivables to csx trade receivables a bankruptcyremote special purpose subsidiary a separate subsidiary of csx services the receivables upon transfer the receivables become assets of csx trade receivables and are not available to the creditors of csx or any of its other subsidiaries in the event csx trade receivables draws under this facility the company will record an equivalent amount of debt on its consolidated financial statements as of the date of this filing the company has no outstanding balances under this facility

csx corporation 

part ii 

working capital can also be considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its shortterm needs csx had a working capital surplus  of 465 million  and 178 million  at december 2014  and 2013  respectively this increase since the prior year is primarily due to a lower current maturities of longterm debt partially offset by a net decrease in shortterm investments driven by higher sales of these investments also see sources and uses of cash description above 

the company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above although the company currently has a surplus a working capital deficit is not unusual for csx or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity the company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due furthermore csx has sufficient financial capacity including its revolving credit facility trade receivable facility and shelf registration statement to manage its daytoday cash requirements and any anticipated obligations the company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity 

credit ratings 

  credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” and moody’s investors service “moody’s” use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa for sp and moody’s respectively a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 

the cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by csxs longterm credit ratings csxs credit ratings improved during 2014 as of december 2013  and december 2014  sps longterm rating on csx was bbb stable moodys improved the longterm credit rating on csx from baa2 at december 2013  to baa1 stable as of december 2014  ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sp and moody’s respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade if csxs credit ratings were to decline to below investment grade levels the company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt in addition a decline in csx’s credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market’s demand and thus the company’s ability to readily issue new debt

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results may differ from those estimates these estimates and assumptions are discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors on a regular basis consistent with the prior year significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas 

 

casualty environmental and legal reserves 

  casualty 

casualty reserves of 265 million  in 2014 represent accruals for personal injury occupational injury and asbestos claims the companys selfinsured retention amount for these claims is 50 million  per occurrence currently no individual claim is expected to exceed the companys selfinsured retention amount in accordance with the contingencies topic  in the financial accounting standards boards fasb accounting standards codification asc to the extent the value of an individual claim exceeds the selfinsured retention amount the company would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries these reserves fluctuate based upon the timing of payments as well as changes in independent thirdparty estimates which are reviewed by management actual results may vary from estimates due to the number type and severity of the injury costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation most of the companys casualty claims relate to csxt unless otherwise noted below defense and processing costs which historically have been insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future are not included in the recorded liabilities during 2014 2013 and 2012 there were no  significant changes in estimate recorded to adjust casualty reserves 

personal injury 

personal injury reserves represent liabilities for employee workrelated and thirdparty injuries workrelated injuries for csxt employees are primarily subject to the federal employers’ liability act “fela” in addition to fela liabilities employees of other csx subsidiaries are covered by various state workers’ compensation laws the federal longshore and harbor workers’ compensation program or the maritime jones act 

csxt retains an independent actuary to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims an analysis is performed by the actuary quarterly and is reviewed by management the methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims it is based largely on csxts historical claims and settlement experience

occupational  asbestos 

occupational claims arise from allegations of exposures to certain materials in the workplace such as solvents soaps chemicals collectively referred to as “irritants” and diesel fuels like exhaust fumes or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions such as repetitive stress injuries carpal tunnel syndrome and hearing loss 

the company is also party to a number of asbestos claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the workplace the heaviest possible exposure for employees resulted from work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines that were largely phased out beginning around the 1950s other types of exposures however including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials continued until these exposures were substantially eliminated by 1985 additionally the company has retained liability for asbestos claims filed against its previously owned international container shipping business diseases associated with asbestos typically have long latency periods amount of time between exposure to asbestos and the onset of the disease which can range from ten  to 40  years after exposure 

occupational claims excluding asbestos are analyzed on a quarterly basis by an independent actuary in order to determine the number of unasserted or incurred but not reported “ibnr” claims the actuary’s analyses are reviewed by management with the exception of carpal tunnel management has determined that seven years is the most probable time period in which these unasserted occupational claim filings and claim values can be estimated carpal tunnel claims use a threeyear period to estimate the reserve due to the shorter latency period for these types of injuries 

asbestos claims are analyzed by an independent specialist in order to determine the number of unasserted or incurred but not reported “ibnr” claims since exposure to asbestos has been substantially eliminated management reviews asserted asbestos claims quarterly and the review by the specialist is completed annually in 2014 management increased the forecast period from seven years to ten years based on a review of historical settlement trends management concluded that ten years is the most probable time period in which unasserted asbestos claim filings and claim values can be estimated the company does not believe there is sufficient data to justify a projection period longer than ten years at this time the change in the forecast period resulted in an immaterial increase in the asbestos reserves during 2014 

the actuary and specialist analyze csxt’s historical claim filings settlement amounts and dismissal rates to determine future anticipated claim filing rates and average settlement values for occupational and asbestos claims reserves the potentially exposed population is estimated by using csxt’s employment records and industry data from this analysis the actuary and specialist provide estimates of the ibnr claims liabilities 

the estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for these reserves a 1  increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of occupational and asbestos ibnr claims or the average claim values would result in approximately a 1 million  increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted occupational and asbestos claims

environmental 

environmental reserves were 94 million  for 2014  the company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 250  environmentally impaired sites many of these are or may be subject to remedial action under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 also known as the superfund law or similar state statutes most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations a number of these proceedings however are based on allegations that the company or its predecessors sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment recycling or disposal in addition some of the company’s land holdings were leased to others for commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the company 

in any such proceedings the company is subject to environmental cleanup and enforcement actions under the superfund law as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct these costs could be substantial 

in accordance with the asset retirement and environmental obligations topic  in the asc the company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least quarterly giving consideration to a number of factors such as 

 

these recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted and include future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs but exclude any anticipated insurance recoveries based on the review process the company has recorded amounts to cover contingent anticipated future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are estimable and probable payments related to these liabilities are expected to be made over the next several years environmental remediation costs are included in materials supplies and other on the consolidated income statements 

currently the company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities if any on some sites until completion of future environmental studies in addition conditions that are currently unknown could at any given location result in additional exposure the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated based upon information currently available however the company believes its environmental reserves accurately reflect the cost of remedial actions currently required

legal 

in accordance with the contingencies topic  in the asc an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated if no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred 

the company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above the amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings newly discovered or developed evidence or changes in laws regulations and evidentiary standards see item 3 legal proceedings for further discussion of these items 

pension and postretirement medical plan accounting 

the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried management personnel for employees hired prior to january 1 2003 the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement for employees hired in 2003 or thereafter benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age service and compensation   as of december 2014  the projected benefit obligation for the company’s pension plans and other postemployment benefit plans were 3 billion  and 340 million  respectively no  significant contributions to the companys qualified pension plans are expected in 2015  

in addition to these plans the company sponsors a postretirement medical plan and a life insurance plan that provide benefits to fulltime salaried management employees hired prior to january 1 2003 upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met medicareeligible retirees are covered by a health reimbursement arrangement which is an employerfunded account that can be used for reimbursement of eligible medical expenses nonmedicare eligible retirees are covered by a selfinsured program partially funded by participating retirees the life insurance plan is noncontributory 

for information related to the funded status of the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans see note 8 employee benefit plans 

the accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the compensationretirement benefits topic  in the asc this rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following 

 

the company engages independent actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the company selects these amounts are reviewed by management 

 45 

csx corporation

critical accounting estimates  continued   

discount rates 

discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component of pension and postretirement expense discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other postretirement benefits could be effectively settled or in other words how much it would cost the company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the companys expected future benefit payments the company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans expected benefit payments 

the discount rates used by the company to value its 2014  pension and postretirement obligations are 400  and 360  respectively for 2013  the discount rate used by the company to value its pension and postretirement obligations was 475  and 425  respectively discount rates may differ for pension and postretirement benefits due to varying duration of the liabilities for projected payments for each plan as of december 2014  the estimated duration of pensions and postretirement benefits is approximately 12  years and 8  years respectively 

each year these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates in general if interest rates decline or rise the assumed discount rates will change 

longterm rate of return on plan assets 

the expected longterm average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation in estimating that rate the company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected longterm rate of return on assets as this assumption is longterm it is adjusted less frequently than other assumptions used in pension accounting the longterm rate of return on plan assets used by the company to value its pension obligation was 725  and 750  in 2014  and 2013  respectively 

salary scale inflation rates 

salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the company the company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates the company used a salary scale rate of 375  to value its 2014  and 2013  pension obligations 

other assumptions 

the calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to health care cost trend rates mortality rates turnover and retirement age these assumptions are based upon historical data recent plan experience and industry trends and are selected by management

2015  estimated pension and postretirement expense 

net pension and postretirement benefits expense for 2015  is expected to be approximately  70 million  and  20 million  respectively compared to 58 million  and 20 million  respectively in 2014  the increase in pension expense is primarily related to lower discount rates and adoption of new mortality tables partially offset by favorable pension asset experience 

the following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effect of changes in certain assumptions like discount rates salaries and health care costs on the 2014  estimated pension and postretirement expense 



depreciation policies for assets utilizing the grouplife method 

the company depreciates its rail assets including mainline track locomotives and freight cars using the grouplife method of accounting assets depreciated under the grouplife method comprise 85  of total fixed assets of 39 billion  on a gross basis at december 2014  all other assets of the company are depreciated on a straightline basis the grouplife method aggregates assets with similar lives and characteristics into groups and depreciates each of these groups as a whole when using the grouplife method an underlying assumption is that each group of assets as a whole is used and depreciated to the end of its recoverable life 

the company currently utilizes more than 130  different depreciable asset categories to account for depreciation expense for the railroad assets that are depreciated under the grouplife method of accounting examples of depreciable asset categories include 18  different categories for crossties due to the different combinations of density classifications and asset types by utilizing various depreciable categories the company can more accurately account for the use of its assets all assets of the company are depreciated on a time or life basis 

the company believes the grouplife method of depreciation closely approximates the straightline method of depreciation additionally due to the nature of most of its assets eg track is one contiguous connected asset the company believes that this is the most effective way to properly depreciate its assets 

under the grouplife method of accounting the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying managements assumptions regarding the service lives of its properties a depreciation study also referred to as a life study is the periodic review of asset service lives salvage values accumulated depreciation and other related factors for group assets conducted by a thirdparty specialist analyzed by the company’s management and approved by the stb the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices the stb requires depreciation studies be performed for equipment assets every three  years and for road eg bridges and signals and track eg rail ties and ballast assets every six  years in 2014 the company completed a depreciation study for its road and track assets in 2012 the company completed a depreciation study for its equipment assets and a technical update an update to the prior depreciation study for its road and track assets the company believes the frequency currently required by the stb provides adequate review of asset service lives and that a more frequent review would not result in a material change due to the longlived nature of most of the assets 

 47 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates  continued 

changes in asset service lives due to the results of the depreciation studies are applied on a prospective basis and could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense and thus the companys results of operations 

there are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include 

 

for retirements or disposals of depreciable rail assets that occur in the ordinary course of business the asset cost net of salvage value or sales proceeds is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized as individual assets within a specific group are retired resulting gains and losses are recorded in accumulated depreciation as part of the depreciation study an assessment of the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is made to determine if it is deficient or in excess of the appropriate amount indicated by the study any such deficiency or excess including any deferred gains or losses is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service life of the asset group until the next required depreciation study since the overall assumption with grouplife is that the assets within the group on average have the same service life and characteristics it is therefore concluded that the deferred gains and losses offset over time 

in the event that large groups of assets are removed from service as a result of unusual acts or sales resulting gains and losses are recognized immediately these acts are not considered to be in the normal course of business and are therefore recognized when incurred examples of such acts would be the major destruction of assets due to significant storm damage eg major hurricanes the sale of a rail line segment to another railroad or the disposal of an entire class of assets eg disposal of all refrigerated freight cars 

recent experience with depreciation studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes which did not materially affect the company’s annual depreciation expense of 12 billion  and 11 billion  for 2014  and 2013  respectively a 1  change in the average life of all grouplife assets would result in an approximate 10 million  change to the company’s annual depreciation expense

income taxes 

csx accounts for income taxes in accordance with the income taxes topic  in the asc that addresses how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under this topic the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the amount recognized in the financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent  likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 

csx files a consolidated federal income tax return which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries examinations of the federal income tax returns of csx have been completed through 2013  during 2014  the company participated in a contemporaneous internal revenue service “irs” audit of tax year 2014  management believes an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed while the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty it is the opinion of csx management that none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition results of operations or liquidity of csx an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items however could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year as of december 2014  the company’s uncertain tax positions were 21 million

financial information 

  

see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for operating revenue operating income and total assets for each of the last three fiscal years 

  

company history 

  

a leader in freight rail transportation for more than 185 years the company’s heritage dates back to the early nineteenth century when the baltimore and ohio railroad company “bo” – the nation’s first common carrier – was chartered in 1827 since that time the company has built on this foundation to create a railroad that could safely and reliably service the everincreasing demands of a growing nation 

  

since its founding numerous railroads have combined with the former bo through merger and consolidation to create what has become csx each of the railroads that combined into the csx family brought new geographical reach to valuable markets gateways cities ports and transportation corridors 

  

csx was incorporated in 1978 under virginia law in 1980 the company completed the merger of the chessie system and seaboard coast line industries into csx the merger allowed the company to connect northern population centers and appalachian coal fields to growing southeastern markets later the company’s acquisition of key portions of conrail inc allowed csxt to link the northeast including new england and the new york metropolitan area with chicago and midwestern markets as well as the growing areas in the southeast already served by csxt this current rail network allows the company to directly serve every major market in the eastern united states with safe dependable environmentally responsible and fuel efficient freight transportation and intermodal service 

  

competition 

  

the business environment in which the company operates is highly competitive shippers typically select transportation providers that offer the most compelling combination of service and price service requirements both in terms of transit time and reliability vary by shipper and commodity as a result the company’s primary competition varies by commodity geographic location and mode of available transportation

csx corporation 

part i 

csxt’s primary rail competitor is norfolk southern railway which operates throughout much of the company’s territory other railroads also operate in parts of the company’s territory depending on the specific market competing railroads and deregulated motor carriers may exert pressure on price and service levels for further discussion on the risk of competition to the company see item 1a risk factors 

  

regulatory environment 

the companys operations are subject to various federal state provincial canada and local laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses operating in the united states and canada in the us the railroad operations conducted by the companys subsidiaries including csxt are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the surface transportation board “stb” the federal railroad administration “fra” and its sister agency within the us department of transportation the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration “phmsa” together fra and phmsa have broad jurisdiction over railroad operating standards and practices including track freight cars locomotives and hazardous materials requirements in addition the us environmental protection agency “epa” has regulatory authority with respect to matters that impact the companys properties and operations the epa is considering regulatory action directed towards the railroad industry governing the disposal of creosote crossties and seeking to increase air emission regulations that may impact our operations or increase costs similarly the transportation security administration “tsa” a component of the department of homeland security has broad authority over railroad operating practices that may have homeland security implications in canada the railroad operations conducted by the company’s subsidiaries including csxt are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the canadian transportation agency 

    

although the staggers act of 1980 significantly deregulated the us rail industry the stb has broad jurisdiction over rail carriers the stb regulates routes fuel surcharges conditions of service rates for nonexempt traffic acquisitions of control over rail common carriers and the transfer extension or abandonment of rail lines among other railroad activities 

in 2008 congress enacted the rail safety improvement act the “rsia” the legislation includes a mandate that all class i freight railroads implement an interoperable positive train control system “ptc” by december 31 2015 implementation of a ptc system is designed to prevent traintotrain collisions overspeed derailments incursions into established workzone limits and train diversions onto another set of tracks in 2012 the association of american railroads aar advised the fra on behalf of the industry that a nationwide interoperable ptc network could not be completed by the deadline in 2012 the fra revised its final rule on the design operational requirements and implementation of ptc technology and is now reexamining certain additional aspects of the rule in response to rail industry concerns in 2012 the fra filed a report with congress stating that it also believed that the majority of railroads would not be able to complete ptc implementation by the 2015 deadline and recommending that congress amend the rsia to allow the fra to grant conditional extensions of the 2015 deadline 

ptc must be installed on all main lines with passenger and commuter operations as well as most of those over which toxicbyinhalation hazardous materials are transported the company expects to incur significant capital costs in connection with the implementation of ptc as well as related ongoing operating expenses csx currently estimates that the total multiyear cost of ptc implementation will be at least 17 billion  for the company total ptc spending through 2013 was  875 million

csx corporation 

part i 

in 2012 the stb announced that it would accept comments on a proposal by the national industrial transportation league that would require class i railroads to provide a form of competitive access to customers served solely by one railroad under this proposal csx would be required to allow a competing railroad to access certain customers that are currently solely served by csxs network in early 2013 shippers railroads and other parties submitted comments on the proposal after the comment period ended the stb announced it would hold a hearing on the proposal which is scheduled for march 25 2014 

in july 2013 the stb released a decision that raised the limitations on the monetary recovery that a shipper may obtain when bringing a simplified rate reasonableness case the stb also made a number of technical modifications to current rate case methodologies including a change to the interest rate a railroad must pay when it is found to have assessed unreasonable rates and refunds are ordered csx and norfolk southern have filed a joint appeal to the dc circuit and a decision is expected by the end of 2014 

implementation of either of these two proposals could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations and liquidity as well as its ability to invest in enhancing and maintaining vital infrastructure for further discussion on regulatory risks to the company see item 1a risk factors

 item 1a risk factors 

  

the risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the companys forwardlooking statements additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the company or that the company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity

csx corporation 

part i 

new legislation or regulatory changes could impact the companys earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices 

  

legislation passed by congress or new regulations issued by federal agencies can significantly affect the revenues costs and profitability of the companys business for instance several of the proposals under consideration by the stb could have a significant negative impact on the companys ability to negotiate prices for the value of rail services provided and meet service standards which could force a reduction in capital spending in addition statutes imposing price constraints or affecting railtorail competition could adversely affect the companys profitability 

  

government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the companys operations and financial results 

  

the company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies including the stb the fra phmsa tsa epa and other state provincial and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic health safety labor environmental tax legal and other matters new rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the companys operating costs or reduce operating efficiencies for example the rsia mandated that the installation of ptc be completed by december 31 2015 on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that have commuter or passenger operations noncompliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the company and can subject the company to fines penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions 

  

climate change and other emissionsrelated legislation and regulation could adversely affect the companys operations and financial results 

  

climate change and other emissionsrelated legislation and regulation have been proposed and in some cases adopted on the federal state provincial and local levels these final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions caps taxes or other controls on emissions in particular the epa has issued various regulations and is expected to issue additional regulations targeting emissions including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles 

any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations could adversely affect the companys operations and financial results by among other things 1 reducing coalfired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards 2 reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the united states 3 increasing the companys fuel capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies and 4 making it difficult for the companys customers in the us and canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner particularly in the absence of similar regulations in other manufacturing countries any of these factors could reduce the amount of shipments the company handles and have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

capacity constraints could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency 

  

csxt may experience rail network difficulties related to i increased passenger activities including highspeed rail in capacityconstrained areas or ii regulatory changes impacting when   csxt can transport freight or service routes which could have a negative effect on csxts operational fluidity leading to deterioration of service asset utilization and overall efficiency

csx corporation 

part i 

general economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight 

  

a decline in general domestic and global economic conditions that affect demand for the commodities and products the company transports could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects for example if the rate of economic growth in asia slows or if european economies contract us export coal volume could be adversely impacted resulting in lower revenue for csx if the company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products the company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs associated with the storage of locomotives railcars and other equipment workforce adjustments and other related activities which could have a material adverse effect on operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

changing dynamics in the us energy markets could negatively impact profitability 

over the past few years production of natural gas in the us has increased dramatically which resulted in lower natural gas prices causing a negative impact on csx as a result of sustained low natural gas prices coalfired power plants have been displaced by natural gasfired power generation facilities if natural gas prices remain low additional coalfired plants could be displaced which could further reduce the companys domestic coal volumes and revenues 

csxt as a common carrier by rail is required by law to transport hazardous materials which could expose the company to significant costs and claims 

  

a train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury property or natural resource damage environmental penalties and remediation obligations such claims if insured could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates under federal regulations csxt is required to transport hazardous materials under the legal duty referred to as the common carrier mandate 

csxt is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials in november 2008 the tsa issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail noncompliance with these rules can subject the company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident finally legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances which could increase operating costs reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials 

  

the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs 

the company is subject to wideranging federal state provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions into the air ground and water the handling storage use generation transportation and disposal of waste and other materials the cleanup of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees if we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which we are responsible in certain circumstances environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties leased properties adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or company predecessors as well as to properties currently owned leased or used by the company

csx corporation 

part i 

the company has been and may in the future be subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated or is strictly liable under environmental laws or regulations and such violations can result in the companys incurring fines penalties or costs relating to the cleanup of environmental contamination although the company believes it has appropriately recorded current and longterm liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing the company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination 

  

the company relies on the stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business 

  

the company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business the performance and reliability of the companys technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively    a cybersecurity attack which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems or other significant disruption or failure could result in a service interruption train accident misappropriation of confidential information process failure security breach or other operational difficulties such an event could result in increased capital insurance or operating costs including increased security costs to protect the companys infrastructure a disruption or compromise of the companys information technology systems even for short periods of time could have a material adverse effect on the company 

disruption of the supply chain could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs 

  

the capital intensive nature and sophistication of core rail equipment including rolling stock equipment locomotives rail and ties limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers if any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage csxt could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage in addition a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and as such adverse developments in international relations new trade regulations disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase csxts operating costs 

  

additionally if a fuel supply shortage were to arise whether due to production restrictions lower refinery outputs a disruption of oil imports adverse political developments or otherwise the company would be negatively impacted 

  

failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes andor work stoppages 

  

most of csxs employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements most of these agreements are bargained for nationally by the national carriers conference committee and negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages under the railway labor acts procedures which include mediation coolingoff periods and the possibility of presidential intervention during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted if however csx is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements or if terms of existing agreements are disputed the employees covered by the railway labor act could strike which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members

csx corporation 

part i 

the company faces competition from other transportation providers 

  

the company experiences competition in pricing service reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and to a less significant extent barges ships and pipelines other transportation providers generally use public rightsofway that are built and maintained by governmental entities while csxt and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks could negatively impact the companys competitive position 

  

future acts of terrorism war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the companys operations 

  

terrorist attacks along with any government response to those attacks may adversely affect the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity csxts rail lines or other key infrastructure may be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war this risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues in addition premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the company could increase dramatically or the coverage may no longer be available 

  

furthermore in response to the heightened risk of terrorism federal state and local governmental bodies are proposing and in some cases have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry for example the department of homeland security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials complying with these or future regulations could continue to increase the companys operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies 

severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage 

  

the companys operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences including floods fires hurricanes and earthquakes as a result the companys rail network may be damaged its workforce may be unavailable fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur in addition the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions insurance maintained by the company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations depending on the nature of the risk insured this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the companys damages or damages to others and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates even with insurance if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service the company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations 

  

the company may be subject to lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures 

  

the company is subject to various claims and lawsuits including putative class action litigation alleging violations of antitrust laws the company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits additionally existing litigation may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in the companys reserve estimates as the ultimate outcome of existing litigation is subject to numerous factors outside of the companys control final judgments or settlement amounts may differ materially from the recorded reserves

increases in the number and magnitude of property damage and personal injury claims could adversely affect the companys operating results 

  

the company faces inherent business risk from exposure to occupational and personal injury claims property damage including storm damage and claims related to train accidents the company may incur significant costs to restore these damages and defend such claims 

  

existing claims may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in reserve estimates as the ultimate outcome of existing claims is subject to numerous factors outside of the companys control although the company establishes reserves and maintains insurance to cover these types of claims final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may differ materially from the recorded reserves and exceed the companys insurance coverage

 item 2 properties 

  

the company’s properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure locomotives and freight cars and equipment these categories and the geography of the network are described below 

track and infrastructure 

  

serving 23  states the district of columbia and the canadian provinces of ontario and quebec the csxt rail network serves among other markets new york philadelphia and boston in the northeast and midatlantic the southeast markets of atlanta miami and new orleans and the midwestern cities of st louis memphis and chicago 

csxt’s track structure includes main thoroughfares connecting terminals and yards known as mainline track track within terminals and switching yards track adjacent to the mainlines used for passing trains track connecting the mainline track to customer locations and track that diverts trains from one track to another known as turnouts total track miles are greater than csxt’s approximately 21000  route miles which reflect the size of csxt’s network that connects markets customers and western railroads at december 2013  the breakdown of track miles was as follows 



in addition to its physical track structure csxt operates numerous yards and terminals these serve as the hubs between csxt and its local customers and as sorting facilities where railcars often are received resorted and placed onto new outbound trains 

the company’s ten largest yards and terminals based on annual volume number of railcars or intermodal containers processed are listed below

network geography 

  

csxt’s operations are primarily focused on four major transportation networks and corridors which are defined geographically and by commodity flows below 

interstate 90 i90 corridor  – this csxt corridor links chicago and the midwest to metropolitan areas in new york and new england this route also known as the “waterlevel route” has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks referred to as double track these superior engineering attributes permit the corridor to support consistent highspeed intermodal automotive and merchandise service this corridor is a primary route for import traffic coming from the far east through western ports moving eastward across the country through chicago and into the population centers in the northeast the i90 corridor is also a critical link between ports in new york new jersey and pennsylvania and consumption markets in the midwest this route carries consumer goods from all three of the company’s major markets – merchandise coal and intermodal 

interstate 95 i95 corridor  – the csxt i95 corridor connects charleston jacksonville miami and many other cities throughout the southeast with the heavily populated midatlantic and northeastern cities of baltimore philadelphia and new york csxt primarily transports food and consumer products as well as metals and chemicals along this line it is the only rail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of the district of columbia and provides access to major eastern ports 

southeastern corridor  – this critical part of the network runs between csxt’s western gateways of chicago st louis and memphis through the cities of nashville birmingham and atlanta and markets in the southeast the southeastern corridor is the premier rail route connecting these key cities gateways and markets and positions csxt to efficiently handle projected traffic volumes of intermodal automotive and general merchandise traffic the corridor also provides direct rail service between the coal reserves of the southern illinois basin and the demand for coal in the southeast 

coal network   – the csxt coal network connects the coal mining operations in the appalachian mountain region and illinois basin with industrial areas in the northeast and midatlantic as well as many river lake and deep water port facilities csxt’s coal network is well positioned to supply utility markets in both the northeast and southeast and to transport coal shipments for export outside of the us almost half  the tons of export coal and nearly all  of the domestic coal that the company transports is used for generating electricity

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

strategic overview 

csx provides railbased freight transportation services including traditional rail service the transport of intermodal containers and trailers as well as other transportation services such as railtotruck transfers and bulk commodity operations with its approximately 31000 dedicated employees the company and the rail industry provide customers with access to an expansive and interconnected transportation network that plays a key role in north american commerce and is critical to the economic success and improved global competitiveness of the united states this improved competitiveness is driven by lower domestic energy prices from natural gas increased foreign labor costs and supply chain factors 

the rail industry benefits from this improved global competitiveness continued economic growth and the shift towards more railbased solutions us demand to move more goods by rail is expected to rise and freight railroads provide the most environmentallyefficient and economical means to meet this growing demand csx can move a ton of freight about 450 miles on one gallon of diesel fuel as trains are four times more fuel efficient than trucks on average shipping freight by rail also alleviates highway congestion eases air pollution and saves energy 

csxs network is positioned to reach nearly twothirds of the us population which accounts for the majority of the nations consumption of goods through this network the company transports a diverse portfolio of commodities and products to meet the countrys needs these products range from agricultural goods such as grains to chemicals automobiles metals building materials paper consumer products and energy sources like coal ethanol and crude oil the company categorizes these products into three primary lines of business merchandise intermodal and coal csxs transportation solutions connect industries and population centers across the united states with each other and with global markets through access to over 70 port facilities whereby meeting the transportation needs of energy producers manufacturers industrial producers construction companies farmers and feed mills wholesalers and retailers and the united states armed forces 

strategic growth opportunities 

intermodal 

csx’s intermodal business is an economical and environmentallyfriendly alternative to transporting freight on highways via truck csx’s intermodal network connects all major population centers east of the mississippi river and is 90 cleared for the use of doublestack two containers high intermodal movements this positions the company to capture a significant share of the incremental domestic intermodal market opportunity estimated at the nine million truckloads in the eastern united states that move over 550 miles the company’s highwaytorail initiatives assist in capturing this traffic and also help customers identify conversion opportunities for both domestic moves and the us portion of international moves 

csx is capturing this opportunity by building new terminals and increasing network capacity to broaden its market presence in key growth areas the companys northwest ohio intermodal terminal which started operations in 2011 is part of csxs national gateway initiative discussed below this highcapacity terminal expands service offerings to customers improves market access to and from east coast ports and consumption centers and enhances the fluidity of the network during 2013 the company opened or expanded terminals in columbus oh louisville ky atlanta ga and worcester ma the company expects to open new terminals in winter haven fl and quebec canada in 2014 these projects further enhance the companys intermodal offering and support future growth

illinois basin coal shift 

energy markets have shifted over the past few years and continue to evolve in spite of recent declines in domestic utility coal consumption that primarily resulted from low natural gas prices coal sourced from mines on the csx network is now becoming more economical as natural gas prices have rebounded from historic lows in addition mining economics are causing a shift from central appalachian coal to thermal coal in the illinois basin and the powder river basin to capitalize on these shifts csx continues to enhance its network to support these changes such as adding sidings track which enables trains on the same line to pass and increasing yard capacity 

export coal 

csx export coal volume and pricing is subject to a high degree of volatility as a result of changes in the global economy competition from foreign coal producers and regulatory shifts over the past few years csx has capitalized on the global coal demand in both steel manufacturing and power generation which is expected to remain high over the long term as developing countries become more urbanized the company remains opportunistic based on the global markets and the resulting level of demand in addition to the company’s ready access to large us coal suppliers and multiple port facilities csx expects to continue to enhance the operating efficiency of its export coal network which will favorably position the company to capitalize on growth as it is made available 

new energy markets 

the ongoing surge in shale drilling for the extraction of oil and natural gas has created the opportunity for csx to serve new energy markets such as crude oil liquefied petroleum gases “lpg” frac sand and other related materials for example csx is capitalizing on the opportunity to move the growing supply of crude oil from the new domestic oil fields particularly those located in the bakken shale region of north dakota to customers at eastern refineries this service also provides greater flexibility in source locations as compared to pipelines 

csx’s lpg market is also benefiting from drilling in the utica shale region which underlies portions of kentucky maryland new york ohio pennsylvania tennessee west virginia and virginia midstream energy companies which are involved in the transportation storage and wholesale of refined petroleum products are taking advantage of the abundance of inexpensive wet gas with newly constructed gas processing plants or “fractionators” in the region rail will also play a vital role in moving lpg products from the fractionators to the market 

csx’s frac sand market a key input in the drilling process has also expanded rapidly over the last few years the company has invested in new operating capacity such as railcars and terminals to accommodate this growth which has been concentrated mainly in the utica and marcellus shale regions the csx network not only provides access to many frac sand transload terminals located near the drilling activity but also offers the advantage of csxdirect routes from several key sand producing regions to the frac sand terminals

over the longer term the improved energy supply outlook for the us will create a sustainable competitive advantage for domestic chemical producers and generate additional growth opportunities for rail since natural gas is the primary component in the production of a wide range of petrochemicals the supply growth and the resulting lower prices have now placed the us amongst the lowest cost production regions in the world this increased competitiveness is sparking significant investment in new us chemical industry capacity for the first time in more than a decade csx is wellpositioned to participate in this growing chemical business over the next several years 

operating initiatives 

  in support of these growth opportunities csx is focused on meeting customers’ needs while improving profitability several key operating initiatives have been implemented over the past several years that lay a foundation for meeting these objectives beginning with the one plan which was implemented nearly ten years ago the company is using advanced network modeling analytics and network tools to create a disciplined scheduled approach to designing and running csxs merchandise and automotive networks the service improvements that continue to result from the implementation of the one plan also drove csx’s ability to deliver strong growth in the intermodal market the one plan continues to be used to identify the most efficient costeffective routes for csxt customers traffic while providing timely service with the fewest handlings and car miles possible 

the second initiative is total service integration “tsi” which is intended to align operating capabilities with customers needs to reduce loading and unloading times and create more capacity tsi was first implemented on the unit train network where it has successfully increased the average number of cars per train and improved asset utilization csx is now implementing tsi for the carload network which focuses on improving the “first and last mile” service experience for carload customers providing a more consistent and reliable service product the carload network is connected to more than 5000 customer facilities and has a high degree of variability each day new tools and technology are allowing the company to more effectively communicate with customers not only providing the service the company has promised to deliver but proactively notifying the customer of service status applying tsi to the carload network will improve service consistency for each merchandise shipper 

the third initiative is service excellence which is building a culture that engages all employees and focuses on the value delivered to customers through improved service the initiative increases employee communication and dialogue to help identify and resolve customer issues at the lowest level improving the customer experience and allowing csx to grow the business this process involves engagement from all operating employees as well as collaboration with sales and marketing employees and ultimately with the company’s customers higher levels of customer service and satisfaction support csx’s ability to profitably grow the business by increasing customer retention price sustainability and asset utilization 

the fourth initiative is enterprise asset management “eam” which is a technology system that will help lower total cost of ownership and maximize the productivity and reliability of the railroad’s physical assets the focus of eam is on locomotives cars and infrastructure projects are currently in place to deploy technology improve processes and reduce unproductive time because the railroad is an asset intensive industry eam helps reduce the overall expense associated with asset ownership by monitoring the overall condition of equipment helping proactively schedule maintenance increasing utilization and also effectively managing the investment required for new or replacement assets the system is also streamlining csx’s asset management operations to improve the time the asset is in service as well as improving csx’s return on assets the intent of this initiative is to deliver operating efficiencies and reduce future capital expenditures associated with asset replacement

publicprivate partnerships 

expanding capacity on us rail networks provides substantial public benefits including job creation increased business activity at us ports reduced highway congestion and lower air emissions therefore csx and its government partners are jointly working to invest in multiyear rail infrastructure projects such as the national gateway this initiative is a publicprivate partnership which will increase intermodal capacity and create substantial environmental and efficiency advantages by clearing key corridors between midatlantic ports and the midwest for doublestack intermodal trains other examples of the company’s publicprivate partnerships are the nearly completed transactions with the commonwealth of massachusetts and the state of florida in both cases the company sold a portion of its track to expand freight and commuter rail service while also alleviating highway congestion 

balanced approach to cash deployment 

csx remains highly committed to delivering value to shareholders through a balanced approach to deploying cash that includes investments in the business dividend growth and share repurchases in 2013 the company invested 23 billion  to further enhance the capacity quality safety and flexibility of its network in addition csx continues to return value to its shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases during 2013 the company announced a 7 percent increase in the quarterly cash dividend to 015 per common share the company has increased its quarterly cash dividend 11 times over the last eight years which represents a 30 percent compounded annual growth rate also during 2013 csx announced a new 1 billion share repurchase program expected to be completed in 2015 based on market and business conditions csx repurchased 353 million  in shares during 2013 under this new program since 2006 csx has repurchased 287 million shares for 83 billion which represents about onethird of total shares outstanding the company also remains committed to an improving investment grade credit profile 

summary 

these strategic growth areas operating initiatives longterm investments and shareholder returns discussed above provide a foundation for volume growth productivity improvement enhanced customer service and continued advancements in the safety and reliability of operations to continue these types of investments the company must be able to operate in an environment in which it can generate adequate returns and drive shareholder value csx will continue to advocate for a fair and balanced regulatory environment to ensure that the value of the companys rail service would be reflected in any potential new legislation or policies

revenue 

volume increased 2 yearoveryear as growth in merchandise and intermodal more than offset lower coal volume total revenue increased by 2 yearoveryear driven by this volume growth and pricing gains across most markets 

merchandise 

agricultural 

agricultural products   volume declined due to a reduction in shipments of feed grain and ethanol feed grain shipments were impacted by low supplier inventories caused by last year’s drought and increased competition from imports ethanol shipments declined as a result of increased competition from imports lower production and competitive losses 

phosphates and fertilizers   volume growth was driven by the reopening of a customer mine that led to more short haul phosphates shipments that were previously sourced from an origin not located on csx’s network 

food and consumer   volume declined due to a reduction in shipments of refrigerated products and alcoholic beverages the decline in refrigerated products volume was driven by lower potato shipments as a result of more normalized production levels compared to the aboveaverage yields in the prior year while the decline in alcoholic beverages was primarily driven by a consolidation within a customer’s distribution network that resulted in lower shipments for csx 

industrial 

chemicals   volume growth was driven by an increase in energyrelated shipments that included crude oil liquefied petroleum gas lpg and frac sand the rise in crude oil shipments was due to increased supply of lowcost crude from shale drilling activity resulting in new shipments to east coast refineries 

  

automotive   finished vehicle shipments increased as north american light vehicle production grew yearoveryear this increase was partially offset by competitive losses in both automotive parts and finished vehicles 

metals   volume was flat as a reduction in steel sheet shipments was offset by growth in aluminum products and steel plates the reduction in shipments of steel sheet which is used in automotive manufacturing was driven by competitive losses mill closures and source shifts shipments of aluminum product which is used in a variety of products like packaging and construction increased due to modal conversions shipments of steel plate which is used in a wide range of end markets including construction structural and energy applications increased in support of continued growth in energyrelated markets

2012  vs 2011  results of operations 

revenue 

csx full year results reflect a 1 yearoveryear volume decline as lower coal shipments were partially offset by growth in intermodal and automotive volume pricing gains and higher fuel recovery drove increases in revenue per unit in all markets 

merchandise 

agricultural 

agricultural products   volume decreased due to reduced shipments of corn and ethanol corn shipments for animal feed declined as drought conditions in the midwest impacted harvest levels and drove corn prices higher further contributing to this decline customers in the southeast took advantage of lower cost imported grains and a strong local crop both of which are transported by truck ethanol shipments declined as a result of higher corn prices and reduced gasoline demand 

phosphates and fertilizers   volume was flat yearoveryear fertilizer shipments were lower in the first half of the year as the expectation of moderating prices resulted in delayed purchases by farmers this decline in the first half was offset by growth in fertilizer in the second half resulting from low river levels that shifted business that traditionally moves on barge to rail additionally producers advanced shipments of fertilizer in the fourth quarter in anticipation of an expected increased application by farmers in 2013 

food and consumer   volume declined yearoveryear appliance shipments were lower due to intermodal conversions lower sales incentives by manufacturers and a moderating economy the decline in appliances was partially offset by growth in refrigerated products due to highwaytorail conversions 

industrial 

chemicals   volume growth was driven by an increase in energyrelated markets that include frac sand lpg and crude oil due to the increase in shale drilling activity additionally plastics shipments grew to support growth predominately in automotive and packaging 

  

automotive   volume grew as north american light vehicle production increased 17 to meet pent up demand as the average vehicle age in the us reached record highs 

metals   volume was slightly lower primarily due to the decline in scrap shipments as a result of lower steel mill utilization rates and lower scrap exports driven by moderating global demand 

housing and construction 

minerals   volume declined due to reduced shipments of aggregates which include crushed stone sand and gravel resulting from the completion of several construction projects versus the prior year additionally shipments of salt declined in the early part of 2012 as inventories remained high due to reduced road application during the previous mild winter 

 32 

csx corporation

waste and equipment   volume declines were led by reduced shipments of military and machinery equipment which were negatively impacted by the expiration of the federal tax credit on the production of wind energy machinery additionally waste shipments decreased as several customer remediation projects were completed 

  forest products   volume increased in building products due to recovering demand for housing and construction which was partially offset by a decline in the paper markets affected by electronic media substitution 

coal 

shipments of utility coal declined primarily driven by low natural gas prices which drove displacement of coal at utilities served by csx in addition utility stockpiles remained well above target levels and overall electric generation in the eastern us declined utility coal declines were partially offset by higher export shipments driven by increased shipments of us thermal coal in 2012 csx shipped 478 million tons of export coal 

intermodal 

intermodal volume increased due to growth in both domestic and international markets domestic shipment growth resulted from highwaytorail conversions and increased demand from both new and existing customers international growth was driven by a new customer and expanded service offerings primarily enabled by the northwest ohio terminal 

expenses 

in 2012 total expenses decreased 26 million compared to prior year descriptions of each expense category as well as significant yearoveryear changes are described below

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures including those to address regulatory and legislative requirements to have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity its balance sheet sources and uses of cash flow and external factors should be reviewed 

material changes in the consolidated balance sheets and significant cash flows 

consolidated balance sheets 

csxs balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of csxs balanced approach in deploying capital for the benefit of its shareholders which includes investments in infrastructure dividend improvement and share repurchases 

total assets increased   11 billion  from prior year primarily due to the increase in net properties of 12 billion  resulting from capital investments this increase was partially offset by the decline in cash and shortterm investments of 292 million  

total liabilities and shareholders equity combined increased   11 billion  this increase was primarily due to net earnings of 1864 million  and the increase in deferred income taxes of 566 million primarily related to accelerated tax depreciation as well as the tax impact of the unrecognized gain related to pension and other postemployment benefits plans which was recorded in 2013 partially offsetting these increases were dividends paid of 600 million  share repurchases of 353 million  and a net reduction in total debt of 277 million 

sources of cash 

the company has multiple sources of cash first the company generates cash from operations in 2013  the company generated 33 billion  of cash from operating activities which increased   321 million  from prior year this increase  was primarily driven by a 275 million contribution to the companys qualified pension plans in the prior year that did not repeat in 2012 the company generated 29 billion of cash from operating activities which decreased 545 million from the prior year this decrease was primarily driven by a pension plan contribution as mentioned above higher payments for income taxes as well as payments related to the ratification of labor agreements in 2012 

second csx has access to numerous financing sources including a 1 billion fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in september 2016 as of the date of this filing the company has no outstanding balances under this facility see note 9 debt and credit agreements for more information

csx filed a shelf registration statement with the sec on february 15 2013 this shelf registration statement is unlimited as to amount and may be used subject to market conditions and csx board authorization to issue debt or equity securities at csx’s discretion while csx seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit csx to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time or at all 

uses of cash 

csx continued to invest in its business to create longterm value for shareholders in 2013  and 2012 net cash used in investing activities was driven by 23 billion  of property additions for both years 

the company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for longterm growth through expanding network and terminal capacity funds used for property additions are further described below 



 

 planned capital investments for 2014 are expected to be 23 billion  including expected spending of approximately 300 million  for ptc this 23 billion  excludes investments related to partially or wholly reimbursable publicprivate partnerships where reimbursements may not be fully received in a given year over half of the 2014 investment will be used to sustain the core infrastructure the remaining amounts will be allocated to locomotives freight cars and high return projects that support longterm profitable growth and productivity initiatives that improve the returns of the business such as intermodal terminal capacity projects csx intends to fund capital investments through cash generated from operations 

over the long term the company expects to incur significant capital costs in connection with the implementation of ptc csx estimates that the total multiyear cost of ptc implementation will be at least  17 billion  this estimate includes costs for installing the new system along tracks upgrading locomotives adding communication equipment and developing new technologies total ptc spending through 2013 was  875 million

in addition to capital investments the company uses cash for scheduled payments of debt and leases share repurchases and to pay dividends to shareholders in 2013 net cash used in financing activities was 1232 million  which was an increase  in spending of 564 million  this increase  was driven by higher debt repayments and a lower amount of debt issued partially offset by lower share repurchases in 2012 net cash used in financing activities was 668 million which was a decrease in spending of 745 million share repurchases were lower by 830 million and partially offsetting this were higher dividend payments of 78 million as a result of an increase in the quarterly dividend from 012 to 014 per share in second quarter 2012 

csx is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments csx may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors under item 1a of this form 10k 

liquidity and working capital 

currently csx is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint the company ended the year with 11 billion  of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments csx has a 1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks this facility expires in september 2016 and as of the date of this filing the company has no outstanding balances under this facility additionally in 2013 csx issued a total of 500 million  of new longterm debt csx uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes which may include reduction or refinancing of outstanding indebtedness capital expenditures working capital requirements contributions to the companys qualified pension plan redemptions and repurchases of csx common stock and dividends to shareholders see note 9 debt and credit agreements 

the companys 250 million receivables securitization facility has a 364day term and expires in december 2014  the purpose of this facility is to provide an alternative to commercial paper and a low cost source of shortterm liquidity the company anticipates either renewing the facility or replacing it with another liquiditybased solution under the terms of this facility csxt transfers eligible thirdparty receivables to csx trade receivables a bankruptcyremote special purpose subsidiary a separate subsidiary of csx services the receivables upon transfer the receivables become assets of csx trade receivables and are not available to the creditors of csx or any of its other subsidiaries in the event csx trade receivables draws under this facility the company will record an equivalent amount of debt on its consolidated financial statements as of the date of this filing the company has no outstanding balances under this facility 

working capital can also be considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its shortterm needs csx had a working capital surplus  of 178 million  and 308 million  at december 2013  and 2012  respectively this decline since the prior year is primarily due to cash used for capital investments dividends paid share repurchases and longterm debt repaid which more than offset cash from operations also see sources and uses of cash description above 

the company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above although the company currently has a surplus a working capital deficit is not unusual for csx or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity the company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due furthermore csx has sufficient financial capacity including its revolving credit facility trade receivable facility and shelf registration statement to manage its daytoday cash requirements and any anticipated obligations the company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity

credit ratings 

  

credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” and moody’s investors service “moody’s” use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa for sp and moody’s respectively a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 

the cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by csxs credit ratings csxs credit ratings have improved during 2013 currently csx is rated bbb with a stable outlook by sp and baa2 with a stable outlook by moodys compared to a rating of bbb with a positive outlook by sp and baa2 with a stable outlook by moodys at december 2012 ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sp and moody’s respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade if csxs credit ratings were to decline to below investment grade levels the company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt in addition a decline in csx’s credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market’s demand and thus the company’s ability to readily issue new debt

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results may differ from those estimates these estimates and assumptions are discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors on a regular basis consistent with the prior year significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas 

 

casualty environmental and legal reserves 

  

casualty 

casualty reserves of 280 million  in 2013 represent accruals for personal injury occupational injury and asbestos claims the companys selfinsured retention amount for these claims is 50 million  per occurrence currently no individual claim is expected to exceed the companys selfinsured retention amount in accordance with the contingencies topic  in the financial accounting standards boards fasb accounting standards codification asc to the extent the value of an individual claim exceeds the selfinsured retention amount the company would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries these reserves fluctuate based upon the timing of payments as well as changes in independent thirdparty estimates which are reviewed by management actual results may vary from estimates due to the number type and severity of the injury costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation most of the companys casualty claims relate to csxt unless otherwise noted below defense and processing costs which historically have been insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future are not included in the recorded liabilities during 2013 2012 and 2011 there were no  significant changes in estimate recorded to adjust casualty reserves

personal injury 

  

personal injury reserves represent liabilities for employee workrelated and thirdparty injuries workrelated injuries for csxt employees are primarily subject to the federal employers’ liability act “fela” in addition to fela liabilities employees of other csx subsidiaries are covered by various state workers’ compensation laws the federal longshore and harbor workers’ compensation program or the maritime jones act 

csxt retains an independent actuarial firm to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims an analysis is performed by the independent actuarial firm quarterly and is reviewed by management the methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims it is based largely on csxts historical claims and settlement experience 

during 2013 and 2012 there were no significant changes in estimates in personal injury reserves adjustments to the reserves are included in materials supplies and other in the consolidated income statements 

occupational  asbestos 

occupational claims arise from allegations of exposures to certain materials in the workplace such as solvents soaps chemicals collectively referred to as “irritants” and diesel fuels like exhaust fumes or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions such as repetitive stress injuries carpal tunnel syndrome and hearing loss 

the company is also party to a number of asbestos claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the workplace the heaviest possible exposure for employees resulted from work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines that were largely phased out beginning around the 1950s other types of exposures however including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials continued until these exposures were substantially eliminated by 1985 additionally the company has retained liability for asbestos claims filed against its previously owned international container shipping business diseases associated with asbestos typically have long latency periods amount of time between exposure to asbestos and the onset of the disease which can range from 10 to 40 years  after exposure 

occupational and asbestos claims are analyzed by a thirdparty actuary or specialist the thirdparty specialist respectively in order to determine the number of unasserted or incurred but not reported “ibnr” claims occupational claims analyses are performed by the thirdparty specialist quarterly and are reviewed by management since exposure to asbestos has been substantially eliminated management reviews asserted asbestos claims quarterly and the review by the thirdparty specialist is completed annually with the exception of carpal tunnel management has determined that seven years is the most probable time period in which unasserted claim filings and claim values can be estimated carpal tunnel claims use a threeyear period to estimate the reserve due to the shorter latency period for these types of injuries 

the thirdparty specialists analyze csxt’s historical claim filings settlement amounts and dismissal rates to determine future anticipated claim filing rates and average settlement values for occupational and asbestos claims reserves the potentially exposed population is estimated by using csxs employment records and industry data from this analysis the thirdparty specialists provide an estimate of the ibnr claims liability 

 41 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates  continued 

the estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for these reserves a 1  increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of occupational and asbestos ibnr claims or the average claim values would result in approximately a 1 million  increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted occupational and asbestos claims 

during 2013 and 2012 there were no  significant changes in estimates recorded to adjust occupational or asbestos reserves adjustments in reserves are included in materials supplies and other in the consolidated income statements 

environmental 

  

environmental reserves were 100 million  for 2013  the company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 244  environmentally impaired sites many of these are or may be subject to remedial action under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 or cercla also known as the superfund law or similar state statutes most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations a number of these proceedings however are based on allegations that the company or its predecessors sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment recycling or disposal in addition some of the company’s land holdings were leased to others for commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the company 

in any such proceedings the company is subject to environmental cleanup and enforcement actions under the superfund law as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct these costs could be substantial 

in accordance with the asset retirement and environmental obligations topic  in the asc the company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least quarterly giving consideration to a number of factors such as 

 

these recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted and include future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs but exclude any anticipated insurance recoveries based on the review process the company has recorded amounts to cover contingent anticipated future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are estimable and probable payments related to these liabilities are expected to be made over the next several years environmental remediation costs are included in materials supplies and other on the consolidated income statements 

 42 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates  continued 

currently the company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities if any on some sites until completion of future environmental studies in addition conditions that are currently unknown could at any given location result in additional exposure the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated based upon information currently available however the company believes its environmental reserves accurately reflect the cost of remedial actions currently required 

legal 

in accordance with the contingencies topic  in the asc an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated if no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred 

the company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above the amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings newly discovered or developed evidence or changes in laws regulations and evidentiary standards see item 3 legal proceedings for further discussion of these items 

pension and postretirement medical plan accounting 

the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried management personnel the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement for employees hired in 2003 or thereafter benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age service and compensation   as of december 2013  the projected benefit obligation for the company’s pension plans and other postemployment benefit plans were 27 billion  and 350 million  respectively during 2012 the company made a contribution of 275 million to its qualified pension plans of which 25 million was the required minimum contribution at this time the company anticipates that no  further contributions to its qualified pension plans will be required in 2014  

in addition to these plans the company sponsors a postretirement medical plan and a life insurance plan that provide benefits to fulltime salaried management employees hired prior to january 1 2003 upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met prior to 2011 the postretirement medical plan was partially funded by all participating retirees with retiree contributions adjusted annually beginning in 2011 medicareeligible retirees are covered by a health reimbursement arrangement which is an employerfunded account that can be used for reimbursement of eligible medical expenses nonmedicare eligible retirees are covered by a selfinsured program partially funded by participating retirees the life insurance plan is noncontributory 

for information related to the funded status of the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans see note 8 employee benefit plans 

  

 43 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates  continued 

the accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the compensationretirement benefits topic  in the asc this rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following 

 

the company engages independent external actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the company selects the company reviews the discount rates longterm rate of return on plan assets salary scale inflation rates and other assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends as appropriate 

discount rates 

  

discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component of pension and postretirement expense discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other postretirement benefits could be effectively settled or in other words how much it would cost the company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the companys expected future benefit payments the company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans expected benefit payments 

the discount rates used by the company to value its 2013  pension and postretirement obligations are 475  and 425  respectively for 2012  the discount rate used by the company to value its pension and postretirement obligations was 375  and 320  respectively discount rates may differ for pension and postretirement benefits due to varying duration of the liabilities for projected payments for each plan as of december 2013  the estimated duration of pensions and postretirement benefits is approximately 12  years and 8  years respectively 

each year these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates in general if interest rates decline or rise the assumed discount rates will change 

longterm rate of return on plan assets 

  

the expected longterm average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation in estimating that rate the company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected longterm rate of return on assets as this assumption is longterm it is adjusted less frequently than other assumptions used in pension accounting the longterm rate of return on plan assets used by the company to value its pension obligation was 750  and 775  in 2013  and 2012  respectively 

 44 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates  continued 

salary scale inflation rates 

  

salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the company the company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates the company used a salary scale rate of 375  to value its 2013  and 2012  pension obligations 

other assumptions 

the calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to health care cost trend rates mortality rates turnover and retirement age these assumptions are based upon historical data recent plan experience and industry trends and are selected by management 

2014  estimated pension and postretirement expense 

net pension and postretirement benefits expense for 2014  is expected to be approximately  58 million  and  21 million  respectively compared to 95 million  and 29 million  respectively in 2013  the decrease in pension expense is primarily related to an increase in the discount rate and favorable asset experience 

the following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effect of changes in certain assumptions like discount rates salaries and health care costs on the 2013  estimated pension and postretirement expense 



depreciation policies for assets utilizing the grouplife method 

the company depreciates its rail assets including mainline track locomotives and freight cars using the grouplife method of accounting assets depreciated under the grouplife method comprise over 86  of total fixed assets of 37 billion  on a gross basis at december 2013  all other assets of the company are depreciated on a straightline basis the grouplife method aggregates assets with similar lives and characteristics into groups and depreciates each of these groups as a whole when using the grouplife method an underlying assumption is that each group of assets as a whole is used and depreciated to the end of its recoverable life 

the company currently utilizes more than 130  different depreciable asset categories to account for depreciation expense for the railroad assets that are depreciated under the grouplife method of accounting examples of depreciable asset categories include 18  different categories for crossties due to the different combinations of density classifications and asset types by utilizing various depreciable categories the company can more accurately account for the use of its assets all assets of the company are depreciated on a time or life basis 

 45 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates  continued 

the company believes the grouplife method of depreciation closely approximates the straightline method of depreciation additionally due to the nature of most of its assets eg track is one contiguous connected asset the company believes that this is the most effective way to properly depreciate its assets 

under the grouplife method of accounting the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying managements assumptions regarding the service lives of its properties a depreciation study also referred to as a life study is the periodic review of asset service lives salvage values accumulated depreciation and other related factors for group assets conducted by a thirdparty specialist analyzed by the company’s management and approved by the surface transportation board “stb” the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices the stb requires depreciation studies be performed for equipment assets every three  years and for road eg bridges and signals and track eg rail ties and ballast assets every six  years in 2012 the company completed a depreciation study for its equipment assets and a technical update an update to the prior depreciation study for its road and track assets the company plans to perform a road and track asset depreciation study during 2014 the company believes the frequency currently required by the stb provides adequate review of asset service lives and that a more frequent review would not result in a material change due to the longlived nature of most of the assets 

changes in asset service lives due to the results of the depreciation studies are applied on a prospective basis and could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense and thus the companys results of operations 

there are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include 

 

for retirements or disposals of depreciable rail assets that occur in the ordinary course of business the asset cost net of salvage value or sales proceeds is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized as individual assets within a specific group are retired resulting gains and losses are recorded in accumulated depreciation as part of the depreciation study an assessment of the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is made to determine if it is deficient or in excess of the appropriate amount indicated by the study any such deficiency or excess including any deferred gains or losses is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service life of the asset group until the next required depreciation study since the overall assumption with grouplife is that the assets within the group on average have the same service life and characteristics it is therefore concluded that the deferred gains and losses offset over time 

 46 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates  continued 

in the event that large groups of assets are removed from service as a result of unusual acts or sales resulting gains and losses are recognized immediately these acts are not considered to be in the normal course of business and are therefore recognized when incurred examples of such acts would be the major destruction of assets due to significant storm damage eg major hurricanes the sale of a rail line segment to another railroad or the disposal of an entire class of assets eg disposal of all refrigerated freight cars 

recent experience with depreciation studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes which did not materially affect the company’s annual depreciation expense of 11 billion  and 1 billion  for 2013  and 2012  respectively a 1  change in the average life of all grouplife assets would result in an approximate 10 million  change to the company’s annual depreciation expense 

income taxes 

csx accounts for income taxes in accordance with the income taxes topic  in the asc that addresses how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under this topic the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent  likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 

csx files a consolidated federal income tax return which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries examinations of the federal income tax returns of csx have been completed through 2011  the federal income tax return for 2012  is currently under review during 2013  the company participated in a contemporaneous internal revenue service “irs” audit of tax year 2013  management believes an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed while the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty it is the opinion of csx management that none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition results of operations or liquidity of csx an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items however could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year as of december 2013  the company’s uncertain tax positions were 23 million

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

csx does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes historically the company has used derivative financial instruments to address market risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 

at december 2013  csx had 7 million  of floating rate debt obligations outstanding a 1  fluctuation in interest rates on these notes would cause less than a 1 million  change in interest expense this amount was determined by considering the impact of a hypothetical interest rate fluctuation on the balances of our floating rate debt at december 27 2013

see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for operating revenue operating income and total assets for each of the last three fiscal years 

  

company history 

  

a leader in freight rail transportation for more than 180 years the company’s heritage dates back to the early nineteenth century when the baltimore and ohio railroad company “bo” – the nation’s first common carrier – was chartered in 1827 since that time the company has built on this foundation to create a railroad that could safely and reliably service the everincreasing demands of a growing nation 

  

since its founding numerous railroads have combined with the former bo through merger and consolidation to create what has become csx each of the railroads that combined into the csx family brought new geographical reach to valuable markets gateways cities ports and transportation corridors 

  

csx was incorporated in 1978 under virginia law in 1980 the company completed the merger of the chessie system and seaboard coast line industries into csx the merger allowed the company to connect northern population centers and appalachian coal fields to growing southeastern markets later the company’s acquisition of key portions of conrail inc allowed csxt to link the northeast including new england and the new york metropolitan area with chicago and midwestern markets as well as the growing areas in the southeast already served by csxt this current rail network allows the company to directly serve every major market in the eastern united states with safe dependable environmentally responsible and fuel efficient freight transportation and intermodal service 

  

competition 

  

the business environment in which the company operates is highly competitive shippers typically select transportation providers that offer the most compelling combination of service and price service requirements both in terms of transit time and reliability vary by shipper and commodity as a result the company’s primary competition varies by commodity geographic location and mode of available transportation 

  

csx corporation 

part i 

csxt’s primary rail competitor is norfolk southern railway which operates throughout much of the company’s territory other railroads also operate in parts of the company’s territory depending on the specific market competing railroads and deregulated motor carriers may exert pressure on price and service levels for further discussion on the risk of competition to the company see item 1a risk factors 

  

regulatory environment 

the companys operations are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses in the united states the railroad operations conducted by the companys subsidiaries including csxt are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the surface transportation board “stb” the federal railroad administration “fra” and its sister agency within the us department of transportation the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration “phmsa” together fra and phmsa have broad jurisdiction over railroad operating standards and practices including track freight cars locomotives and hazardous materials requirements additionally the transportation security administration “tsa” a component of the department of homeland security has broad authority over railroad operating practices that may have homeland security implications 

    

although the staggers act of 1980 significantly deregulated the rail industry the stb has broad jurisdiction over rail carriers the stb regulates routes fuel surcharges conditions of service rates for nonexempt traffic acquisitions of control over rail common carriers and the transfer extension or abandonment of rail lines among other railroad activities 

in 2008 congress enacted the rail safety improvement act the “rsia” the legislation includes a mandate that all class i freight railroads implement an interoperable positive train control system “ptc” by december 31 2015 implementation of a ptc system is designed to prevent traintotrain collisions overspeed derailments incursions into established workzone limits and train diversions onto another set of tracks caused by switches left in wrong positions in january 2012 the association of american railroads aar advised the fra on behalf of the industry that a nationwide interoperable ptc network could not be completed by the deadline in may 2012 the fra revised its final rule on the design operational requirements and implementation of ptc technology and is now reexamining certain additional aspects of the rule in response to rail industry concerns in august 2012 the fra filed a report with congress stating that it also believed that the majority of railroads would not be able to complete ptc implementation by the 2015 deadline also in 2012 federal legislation was introduced in both the house of representatives and the senate that would if reintroduced and approved in 2013 delay the ptc implementation deadline of 2015 by three to five years 

ptc must be installed on all main lines with passenger and commuter operations as well as most of those over which toxicbyinhalation hazardous materials are transported the company expects to incur significant capital costs in connection with the implementation of ptc as well as related ongoing operating expenses csx currently estimates that the total multiyear cost of ptc implementation will be at least 17 billion  for the company total ptc spending lifetodate through 2012 was  585 million  

  

csx corporation 

part i 

in july 2012 the stb announced that it would accept comments on a proposal by the national industrial transportation league that would require class i railroads to provide a form of competitive access to customers served solely by one railroad under this proposal csx would be required to allow a competing railroad to access certain customers that are currently solely served by csxs network 

also in july 2012 the stb announced proposed changes to its standards and procedures for establishing maximum reasonable rates for rail shippers where there is an absence of effective competition the proposal includes among other items increasing the limits of recovery available under the agencys simplified rate case methodologies and changing the interest rate payable by a carrier that is found to have assessed unreasonable rates when refunds are ordered 

implementation of either of these two proposals could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations and liquidity as well as its ability to invest in enhancing and maintaining vital infrastructure

the information set forth in item 6 selected financial data is incorporated herein by reference for additional information concerning business conducted by the company during 2012  see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 




 item 1a risk factors 

  

the risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the companys forwardlooking statements additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the company or that the company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

csx corporation 

part i 

new legislation or regulatory changes could impact the companys earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices 

  

legislation passed by congress or new regulations issued by federal agencies can significantly affect the revenues costs and profitability of the companys business for instance several of the proposals under consideration by the stb could have a significant negative impact on the companys ability to determine prices for rail services and meet service standards which could force a reduction in capital spending in addition statutes imposing price constraints or affecting railtorail competition could adversely affect the companys profitability 

  

government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the companys operations and financial results 

  

the company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies including the stb the fra and other state and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic health safety labor environmental tax legal and other matters new rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the companys operating costs or reduce operating efficiencies for example the rsia mandated that the installation of an interoperable positive train control system “ptc” be completed by december 31 2015 on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that have commuter or passenger operations in january 2010 the fra issued its final rule on the design operational requirements and implementation of the new ptc technology in 2012 federal legislation was introduced in both the house of representatives and the senate that would if reintroduced and approved in 2013 delay the ptc implementation deadline of 2015 by three to five years however even if either the regulatory requirements or the implementation date are further revised the rule will continue to impose significant new costs on the company and the rail industry noncompliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the company and can subject the company to fines penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions 

  

climate change and other emissionsrelated legislation and regulation could adversely affect the companys operations and financial results 

  

climate change and other emissionsrelated legislation and regulation have been proposed and in some cases adopted on the federal state provincial canada and local levels these final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions caps taxes or other controls on emissions in particular the us environmental protection agency “epa” has issued various regulations targeting emissions including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles 

any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations could adversely affect the companys operations and financial results by among other things 1 reducing coalfired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards 2 reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the united states 3 increasing the companys fuel capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies and 4 making it difficult for the companys customers in the us and canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner particularly in the absence of similar regulations in countries like india and china any of these factors could reduce the amount of traffic the company handles and have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

csx corporation 

part i 

capacity constraints could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency 

  

csxt may experience rail network difficulties related to i increased passenger activities including highspeed rail in capacityconstrained areas or ii regulatory changes impacting when   csxt can transport freight or service routes which could have a negative effect on csxts operational fluidity leading to deterioration of service asset utilization and overall efficiency 

  

general economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight 

  

a decline in general domestic and global economic conditions that affect demand for the commodities and products the company transports could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects for example if the rate of economic growth in asia slows or if european economies contract us export coal volume could be adversely impacted resulting in lower revenue for csx in the event the company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products the company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs associated with the storage of locomotives rail cars and other equipment workforce adjustments and other related activities which could have a material adverse effect on operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

changing dynamics in the us energy markets could negatively impact freight volumes 

over the past few years production of natural gas in the us has increased dramatically which resulted in lower natural gas prices causing a negative impact on csx as a result of sustained low natural gas prices coalfired power plants have been displaced by natural gasfired power generation facilities if natural gas prices remain low additional coalfired plants could be displaced which could further reduce the companys domestic coal volumes and revenues 

csxt as a common carrier by rail is required by law to transport hazardous materials which could expose the company to significant costs and claims 

  

under federal regulations csxt is required to transport hazardous materials under its common carrier obligation a train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury property or natural resource damage environmental penalties and remediation obligations such claims if insured could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates 

csxt is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials in november 2008 the tsa issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail noncompliance with these rules can subject the company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident finally legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances which could increase operating costs reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials 

  

csx corporation 

part i 

the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs 

the company is subject to wideranging federal state provincial canada and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions into the air ground and water the handling storage use generation transportation and disposal of waste and other materials the cleanup of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees if we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which we are responsible in certain circumstances environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties leased properties adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or company predecessors as well as to properties currently owned leased or used by the company 

  

the company has been and may in the future be subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated or is strictly liable under environmental laws or regulations and such violations can result in the companys incurring fines penalties or costs relating to the cleanup of environmental contamination although the company believes it has appropriately recorded current and longterm liabilities for known and estimable future environmental costs it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing the company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination 

  

the company relies on the stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business 

  

the company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business the performance and reliability of the companys technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively    a cybersecurity attack which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems or other significant disruption or failure could result in a service interruption train accident misappropriation of confidential information process failure security breach or other operational difficulties such an event could result in increased capital insurance or operating costs including increased security costs to protect the companys infrastructure disruption of the companys information technology systems even for short periods of time could have a material adverse effect on the company 

disruption of the supply chain could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs 

  

the capital intensive nature and sophistication of core rail equipment including rolling stock equipment locomotives rail and ties limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers if any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage csxt could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage in addition a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and as such adverse developments in international relations new trade regulations disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase csxts operating costs 

  

additionally if a fuel supply shortage were to arise whether due to the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec other production restrictions lower refinery outputs a disruption of oil imports adverse political developments or otherwise the company would be negatively impacted 

  

csx corporation 

part i 

failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes andor work stoppages 

  

most of csxs employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements the majority of these agreements are bargained for nationally by the national carriers conference committee and negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages under the railway labor acts procedures which include mediation coolingoff periods and the possibility of presidential intervention during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted if however csx is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements or if terms of existing agreements are disputed the employees covered by the railway labor act could strike which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members 

the company faces competition from other transportation providers 

  

the company experiences competition in the form of pricing service reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and to a less significant extent barges ships and pipelines transportation providers such as motor carriers and barges utilize public rightsofway that are built and maintained by governmental entities while csxt and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks could negatively impact the companys competitive position 

  

future acts of terrorism war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the companys operations 

  

terrorist attacks along with any government response to those attacks may adversely affect the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity csxts rail lines or other key infrastructure may be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war this risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues in addition premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the company could increase dramatically or the coverage may no longer be available 

  

furthermore in response to the heightened risk of terrorism federal state and local governmental bodies are proposing and in some cases have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry for example the department of homeland security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials complying with these regulations could continue to increase the companys operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies 

csx corporation 

part i 

severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage 

  

the companys operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences including floods fires hurricanes and earthquakes as a result the companys rail network may be damaged its workforce may be unavailable fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur in addition the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions insurance maintained by the company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations depending on the nature of the risk insured this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the companys damages or damages to others and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates even with insurance if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service the company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations 

  

the company may be subject to lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures 

  

the company is subject to various claims and lawsuits including putative class action litigation alleging violations of antitrust laws the company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits additionally existing litigation may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in the companys reserve estimates as the ultimate outcome of existing litigation is subject to numerous factors outside of the companys control final judgments or settlement amounts may differ materially from the recorded reserves 

increases in the number and magnitude of property damage and personal injury claims could adversely affect the companys operating results 

  

the company faces inherent business risk from exposure to occupational and personal injury claims property damage including storm damage and claims related to train accidents the company may incur significant costs to defend such claims 

  

existing claims may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in reserve estimates as the ultimate outcome of existing claims is subject to numerous factors outside of the companys control although the company establishes reserves and maintains insurance to cover these types of claims final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may differ materially from the recorded reserves and exceed the companys insurance coverage

 item 2 properties 

  

the company’s properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure locomotives and freight cars and equipment these categories and the geography of the network are described below 

track and infrastructure 

  

serving 23  states the district of columbia and the canadian provinces of ontario and quebec the csxt rail network serves among other markets new york philadelphia and boston in the northeast and midatlantic the southeast markets of atlanta miami and new orleans and the midwestern cities of st louis memphis and chicago 

csxt’s track structure includes main thoroughfares connecting terminals and yards known as mainline track track within terminals and switching yards track adjacent to the mainlines used for passing trains track connecting the mainline track to customer locations and track that diverts trains from one track to another known as turnouts total track miles are greater than csxt’s approximately 21000  route miles which reflect the size of csxt’s network that connects markets customers and western railroads at december 2012  the breakdown of track miles was as follows 



in addition to its physical track structure csxt operates numerous yards and terminals these serve as the hubs between csxt and its local customers and as sorting facilities where rail cars often are received resorted and placed onto new outbound trains 

  

the company’s ten largest yards and terminals based on annual volume number of rail cars or intermodal containers processed are listed below

network geography 

  

csxt’s operations are primarily focused on four major transportation networks and corridors which are defined geographically and by commodity flows below 

interstate 90 i90 corridor  – this csxt corridor links chicago and the midwest to metropolitan areas in new york and new england this route also known as the “waterlevel route” has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks referred to as double track these superior engineering attributes permit the corridor to support consistent highspeed intermodal automotive and merchandise service this corridor is a primary route for import traffic coming from the far east through western ports moving eastward across the country through chicago and into the population centers in the northeast the i90 corridor is also a critical link between ports in new york new jersey and pennsylvania and consumption markets in the midwest this route carries consumer goods from all three of the company’s major markets – merchandise coal and intermodal 

interstate 95 i95 corridor  – the csxt i95 corridor connects charleston jacksonville miami and many other cities throughout the southeast with the heavily populated northeastern cities of baltimore philadelphia and new york csxt primarily transports food and consumer products as well as metals and chemicals along this line it is the only rail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of the district of columbia and provides access to major eastern ports 

southeastern corridor  – this critical part of the network runs between csxt’s western gateways of chicago st louis and memphis through the cities of nashville birmingham and atlanta and markets in the southeast the southeastern corridor is the premier rail route connecting these key cities gateways and markets and positions csxt to efficiently handle projected traffic volumes of intermodal automotive and general merchandise traffic the corridor also provides direct rail service between the coal reserves of the southern illinois basin and the demand for coal in the southeast 

coal network   – the csxt coal network connects the coal mining operations in the appalachian mountain region and illinois basin with industrial areas in the northeast and midatlantic as well as many river lake and deep water port facilities csxt’s coal network is well positioned to supply utility markets in both the northeast and southeast and to transport coal shipments for export outside of the us half  the tons of export coal and nearly all  of the domestic coal that the company transports is used for generating electricity

csxt operates more than 4000  locomotives of which over 97  are owned by csxt freight locomotives are the power source used primarily to pull trains switching locomotives are used in yards to sort railcars so that the right railcar is attached to the right train in order to deliver it to its final destination auxiliary units are typically used to provide extra traction for heavy trains in hilly terrain at december 2012  csxt’s fleet of owned and longterm leased locomotives consisted of the following types of locomotives 



  

equipment 

  

in 2012  the average daily fleet of cars on line consisted of approximately 190000  at any time over half of the railcars on the csxt system are not owned or leased by the company examples of these are as follows railcars owned by other railroads which are utilized by csxt shipperfurnished or private cars which are generally used only in that shipper’s service and multilevel railcars used to transport automobiles which are shared among railroads 

  

the company’s revenue generating equipment either owned or longterm leased consists of freight cars and containers as described below 

  

gondolas  – support csxt’s metals markets and provide transport for woodchips and other bulk commodities some gondolas are equipped with special hoods for protecting products like coil and sheet steel 

opentop hoppers  – transport heavy dry bulk commodities such as coal coke stone sand ores and gravel that are resistant to weather conditions 

box cars  – include a variety of tonnages sizes door configurations and heights to accommodate a wide range of finished products including paper auto parts appliances and building materials insulated box cars deliver food products canned goods beer and wine 

  

covered hoppers  – have a permanent roof and are segregated based upon commodity density lighter bulk commodities such as grain fertilizer flour salt sugar clay and lime are shipped in large cars called jumbo covered hoppers heavier commodities like cement ground limestone and sand are shipped in small cube covered hoppers 

multilevel flat cars  – transport finished automobiles and are differentiated by the number of levels bilevels for large vehicles such as pickup trucks and suvs and trilevels for sedans and smaller automobiles 

flat cars  – used for shipping intermodal containers and trailers or bulk and finished goods such as lumber pipe plywood drywall and pulpwood

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

strategic overview 

csx provides railbased freight transportation services including traditional rail service and the transport of intermodal containers and trailers with its approximately 32000 dedicated employees the company and the rail industry provide customers with access to an expansive and interconnected transportation network that plays a key role in north american commerce and is critical to the economic success and global competitiveness of the united states this global competitiveness and the expected continued growth in manufacturing is beneficial to the rail industry over the longterm the us demand to move more goods by rail is expected to rise along with the need to reduce highway congestion and greenhouse gas emissions csx and freight railroads provide the most environmentallyefficient and economical means to meet this growing demand csx can move a ton of freight approximately 450 miles on one gallon of fuel shipping freight by rail also alleviates highway congestion on average trains are more fuel efficient than trucks as one rail car can move the equivalent of three truckloads 

csxs network is positioned to reach nearly twothirds of americans who account for the majority of the nations consumption of goods through this network the company transports a diverse portfolio of commodities and products to meet the countrys needs these products range from agricultural goods such as grains to chemicals automobiles metals building materials paper consumer products and energy sources like coal ethanol and crude oil the company categorizes these products into three primary lines of business merchandise intermodal and coal csxs transportation solutions connect industries across the united states with each other and with global markets by meeting the transportation needs of port facilities energy producers manufacturers industrial producers construction companies farmers and feed mills wholesalers and retailers and the united states armed forces 

the rebirth of the us automotive industry and the development of new domestic energy sources have led to increased volume in some of csxs merchandise markets specifically in shipments of automobiles frac sand crude oil and pipe the recent growth in us manufacturing is largely due to an increase in foreign labor costs as well as lower domestic energy prices resulting from the increase in the supply of natural gas these among other economic and supply chain factors are encouraging manufacturers to expand or move production back to the united states the company continues to position itself to secure volume related to growth in these markets 

strategic growth initiatives 

the company is focusing on three key strategic growth initiatives related to intermodal export coal and an initiative to enhance customer service quality also known as total service integration the company believes these opportunities will allow it to gain additional domestic and international volume while improving service offerings to its customers in a costeffective manner 

csx corporation 

part ii 

intermodal 

the companys intermodal business is an economical environmentallyfriendly alternative to transporting freight on highways via truck csx is capitalizing on this opportunity by building new terminals and increasing network capacity to broaden its market presence in key growth areas the companys northwest ohio intermodal terminal which became operational in 2011 is part of csxs national gateway initiative discussed below this highcapacity terminal expands service offerings to customers improves market access to and from east coast ports and consumption centers and enhances the fluidity of the network during 2012 the company completed construction of new intermodal terminals in louisville kentucky and worcester massachusetts and completed major terminal expansion projects in charlotte north carolina and columbus ohio in addition the company began construction on a new intermodal terminal in winter haven florida this year these projects further enhance the companys intermodal offering and support the growth the company experienced over the last few years 

export coal 

  

economic expansion in china india and brazil and other developing countries has generated a growth cycle in export coal demand over the long term demand for coal in these countries is expected to remain high due to rising consumption as they become more urbanized which is increasing the need for electric power generation and steel production these increases in global coal demand are likely to be met by shipments from coal producing countries including the us which has abundant coal deposits in addition to the companys ready access to large us coal suppliers and multiple port facilities csx continues to enhance the capacity and operating efficiency of its export coal network which favorably positions the company to capitalize on this growth opportunity   in the long term this export coal demand is expected to partially offset declines in domestic utility coal volume that has resulted from low natural gas prices and environmental regulation although the company expects longterm growth in the export coal market csx export traffic volume and pricing will be subject to a high degree of volatility as a result of changes in the global economy and competition from foreign coal producers 

  

total service integration 

csxs total service integration “tsi” initiative supports growth through improved service optimized train size and increased asset utilization for unit train shipments from origin to destination building on this momentum csx is now focusing on another initiative to enhance service quality for customers who ship by the carload this program tsi carload focuses where the customer is impacted most   during the first and last mile of service these enhancements aim to improve service levels and reliability of rail transportation over other modes of transportation these improvements to operational processes customer communication and service are better aligning csxs operating capabilities with customers needs and enabling the company to capitalize on the growth opportunities described above during 2012 csx implemented new technology and processes to provide customers with proactive and transparent communications these tools include real time notifications of departures and work to be completed proactive alerts for cars that may be delayed and notices for work that will not be performed

publicprivate partnerships 

  

expanding capacity on us rail networks provides substantial public benefits including job creation increased business activity at us ports reduced highway congestion and lower air emissions therefore csx and its government partners are working jointly to invest in multiyear rail infrastructure projects such as the national gateway   this initiative is a publicprivate partnership which will increase intermodal capacity and create substantial environmental and efficiency advantages by clearing key corridors between midatlantic ports and the midwest for doublestack intermodal trains 

  

csx is engaged in another major partnership initiative with the commonwealth of massachusetts to expand freight and commuter rail service this partnership provided an expanded intermodal terminal footprint relocation of bulk commodity operations and doublestack intermodal clearance from worcester to the new york state line in 2012 csx sold its corridor between boston and worcester to the commonwealth to allow increased commuter rail service while retaining the right to utilize this corridor for freight service 

csx entered into a transaction with the state of florida in 2011 to help alleviate highway congestion through a new commuter rail operation known as sunrail csx sold a portion of its track to the state of florida for its new commuter rail and will invest the proceeds in additional freight rail capacity and infrastructure within the state 

balanced approach to cash deployment 

csx remains highly committed to delivering value to shareholders through a balanced approach to deploying cash that includes investments in the business dividend growth and share repurchases in 2012 the company invested 23 billion to further enhance the capacity quality safety and flexibility of its network included in this amount is 166 million  of investments related to reimbursable publicprivate partnerships where reimbursements may not be fully received in a given year in addition csx continues to return value to its shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases the company has increased its quarterly cash dividend 10 times over the last seven year period which represents a 33 percent compounded annual growth rate in 2012 csx completed a 2 billion share repurchase authority that was announced in 2011 while delivering shareholder value through this balanced approach to cash deployment the company remains committed to an improving investment grade credit profile 

in summary these strategic initiatives and longterm investments discussed above provide a foundation for volume growth and productivity improvement enhanced customer service and continued advancements in the safety and reliability of operations to continue these types of investments the company must be able to operate in an environment in which it can generate adequate returns and drive shareholder value csx will continue to advocate for a fair and balanced regulatory environment to ensure that the value of the companys rail service would be reflected in any potential new legislation or policies

2012  highlights 

operating income increased 1 to 35 billion and the operating ratio improved 30 basis points to 706 both improved on the strength of efficiency gains and resource adjustments 



in 2012 revenue was slightly higher yearoveryear despite lower volume volume decreased 1 from prior year as lower coal shipments were partially offset by growth in intermodal and automotive volume pricing gains and higher fuel recovery drove increases in revenue per unit in all markets 

 expenses were lower when compared to prior year for several reasons real estate gains as well as lower incentive compensation and cost savings from crew labor efficiencies and lower volume reduced expenses these decreases were offset by higher depreciation and inflationrelated costs

in addition to the financial highlights described above the company measures and reports safety and service performance the company strives for continuous improvement in these measures through training initiatives and investment for example the companys safety and train accident prevention programs rely on broad employee involvement the programs utilize operating rules training compliance measurement root cause analysis and communication that are intended to create a safer environment for employees and the public continued capital investment in the companys assets including track bridges signals equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance 

the company routinely collaborates with the fra and industry organizations as well as federal state and local governments on the development and implementation of safety programs and initiatives for example csx operation lifesaver inc the us department of transportation and other major railroads from across the country have partnered in the common sense campaign to reduce the number of injuries and deaths around tracks and trains in addition to these initiatives csxt also has an ongoing public safety program to clearcut trees and vegetation at public passive highwayrail intersections crossings with no flashing lights or gates to improve the publics ability to discern rail hazards 

at csx operational success is built on employee commitment to customer service while at the same time maintaining a constant focus on safety in 2012 both key safety measures improved significantly versus the previous year the fra reportable personal injury frequency index improved by 26 percent year over year to a record low of 069 showing extraordinary employee dedication to the companys safety initiative the reported fra train accident frequency rate improved 18 percent year over year to 198 

network reliability and service metrics showed strong improvements during 2012 ontime originations improved 24 percent to a record 89 percent and ontime arrivals improved 29 percent to 80 percent average train velocity increased 10 percent to 227 miles per hour while dwell improved 8 percent to 237 hours

2012  vs 2011  results of operations 





csx corporation 

part ii 

2012  vs 2011  results of operations 

  

csx full year results reflect a 1 yearoveryear volume decline as lower coal shipments were partially offset by growth in intermodal and automotive volume pricing gains and higher fuel recovery drove increases in revenue per unit in all markets as a result total revenue was slightly higher yearoveryear 

merchandise 

agricultural 

agricultural products   volume decreased due to reduced shipments of corn and ethanol corn shipments for animal feed declined as drought conditions in the midwest impacted harvest levels and drove corn prices higher further contributing to this decline customers in the southeast took advantage of lower cost imported grains and a strong local crop both of which are transported by truck ethanol shipments declined as a result of higher corn prices and reduced gasoline demand 

phosphates and fertilizers   volume was flat yearoveryear fertilizer shipments were lower in the first half of the year as the expectation of moderating prices resulted in delayed purchases by farmers this decline in the first half was offset by growth in fertilizer in the second half resulting from low river levels that shifted business that traditionally moves via barge to rail additionally producers advanced shipments of fertilizer in the fourth quarter in anticipation of an expected increased application by farmers in 2013 

food and consumer   volume declined yearoveryear appliance shipments were lower due to intermodal conversions lower sales incentives by manufacturers and a moderating economy the decline in appliances was partially offset by growth in refrigerated products due to highwaytorail conversions 

industrial 

chemicals   volume growth was driven by an increase in energyrelated markets that include frac sand liquid petroleum gas lpg and crude oil due to the increase in shale drilling activity additionally plastics shipments grew to support growth predominately in automotive and packaging 

  

automotive   volume grew as north american light vehicle production increased 17 to meet pent up demand as the average vehicle age in the us reached record highs 

metals   volume was slightly lower primarily due to the decline in scrap shipments as a result of lower steel mill utilization rates and lower scrap exports driven by moderating global demand 

housing and construction 

emerging markets   volume declined due to reduced shipments of aggregates which include crushed stone sand and gravel resulting from the completion of several road construction projects versus the prior year additionally shipments of salt declined in the early part of this year as inventories remained high due to reduced road application during the previous mild winter 

forest products   volume increased in building products due to recovering demand for housing and construction which was partially offset by a decline in the paper markets affected by electronic media substitution 

csx corporation 

part ii 

coal 

shipments of utility coal declined primarily driven by low natural gas prices which drove displacement of coal at utilities served by csx in addition utility stockpiles remained well above target levels and overall electric generation in the eastern us declined utility coal declines were partially offset by higher export shipments driven by increased shipments of us thermal coal in 2012 csx shipped 478 million tons of export coal 

intermodal 

intermodal volume increased due to growth in both domestic and international markets domestic shipment growth resulted from highwaytorail conversions and increased demand from both new and existing customers international growth was driven by a new customer and expanded service offerings primarily enabled by the northwest ohio terminal

volume and revenue 

  

merchandise 

  

agricultural 

agricultural products  – volume declined as the amount of feed shipments declined as a result of higher corn prices and decreased production from producers of poultry and pork these reductions were slightly offset by growth in ethanol and increased shipments of soybeans into the southeast due to low inventories 

  

phosphates and fertilizers  – shipments of domestic fertilizers grew as farmers replenished inventories to improve crop yields as a result of higher anticipated crop prices export demand was also strong with recovery in exports to central and south america after the prior years drought shipments of phosphate rock which is used to make fertilizer grew as suppliers are stocking up in anticipation of a strong spring season 

food and consumer  – volume decreased as lower appliance shipments resulting from continued weakness in the housing sector was partially offset by strength in truckload conversions of refrigerated products and manufactured goods 

industrial 

chemicals  – volume was flat as strength in frac sand used in the extraction of gas and petroleum resulted from the increase in natural gas drilling this increase was offset by a reduction in basic chemical markets like plastics which experienced weak consumer demand and inventory destocking 

automotive   automotive volume grew as north american automotive production increased to meet pent up demand from delayed purchases during the slowed economy over the last few years 

metals  – volume growth was driven by strong export demand for scrap shipments and higher domestic steel production resulting from strong demand in the automotive and oil and gas sectors for products such as sheet steel and pipe 

housing and construction 

emerging markets  – volume increased primarily driven by improved shipments of aggregates which include crushed stone sand and gravel cement and waste such as construction and demolition debris as a result of new distribution facilities and overall market growth related to the improving economy 

forest products  – volume increased despite the weakness in housingrelated markets primarily related to strength in shipments of pulp board and paper used in packaging for consumer products and increased shipments of building products resulting from inventory replenishments 

csx corporation 

part ii 

coal 

shipments of utility coal declined as electrical generation declined in the eastern us natural gas prices remained low and utility stockpiles were above target levels this decrease was partially offset by higher export shipments driven by greater demand for us coal in europe south america and asia during 2011 csx shipped 402 million tons of export coal    the increase in revenue per unit was driven by improved yield positive mix and fuel recovery 

intermodal 

  

international and domestic shipment growth resulted from expanded service offerings overtheroad conversions and service and network enhancements the increase in revenue per unit was driven by increased fuel recovery improved yields and favorable traffic mix this revenueperunit increase was partially offset by the impact of switching from a purchased transportation arrangement to a domestic interline program in the prior year this program known as umax provides customers with containers for local shipments or transcontinental service provided jointly by csx and union pacific corporation 

other 

  

other revenue increased due to stronger affiliate revenue and higher incidental charges mostly offset by lower benefits for contract volume commitments as compared to the prior year

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures including those to implement regulatory and legislative initiatives in order to have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity its balance sheet sources and uses of cash flow and external factors should be reviewed 

material changes in the consolidated balance sheets and significant cash flows 

consolidated balance sheets 

csxs balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of csxs balanced approach in deploying its capital for the benefit of its shareholders which includes investments in infrastructure dividend improvement and share repurchases 

total assets increased   12 billion  from prior year assets increased  primarily due to the increase in net properties of 11 billion driven by planned capital spending 

total liabilities and shareholders equity increased   12 billion  increases were from total net debt activity of 591 million mostly due to additional borrowings higher deferred income tax liability of 495 million primarily related to the net impact of bonus depreciation on tax accruals and stronger net earnings of 19 billion partially offsetting these increases were share repurchases of 734 million dividends paid of 558 million and a pension plan contribution of 275 million 

sources of cash 

the company has multiple sources of cash first the company generates cash from operations in 2012  the company generated 29 billion  of cash from operating activities which decreased 545 million  from prior year this decrease  was primarily driven by a contribution to the companys qualified pension plans and higher payments for income taxes as well as payments related to the ratification of labor agreements in 2012 in 2011 the company generated 35 billion of cash from operating activities which represented a 230 million increase from the prior year driven by higher earnings

csx corporation 

part ii 

uses of cash 

csx continued to invest in its business to create longterm value for shareholders in 2012  net cash used in investing activities was driven by 23 billion of property additions which was consistent with the prior year in 2011 net cash used in investing activities was also driven by 23 billion of property additions which increased 457 million from prior year 

the company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for longterm growth through expanding network and terminal capacity funds used for property additions are further described below 



 

 planned capital investments for 2013 are 23 billion  including expected spending of approximately 325 million  for positive train control ptc this amount excludes investments related to partially or wholly reimbursable publicprivate partnerships where reimbursements may not be fully received in a given year over half of the 2013 investment will be used to sustain the core infrastructure the remaining amounts will be allocated to locomotives freight cars high return projects that drive growth and productivity such as intermodal terminal capacity and major track expansion along the river line between northern new jersey and the albany ny region csx intends to fund capital investments through cash generated from operations 

over the long term the company expects to incur significant capital costs in connection with the implementation of ptc csx estimates that the total multiyear cost of ptc implementation will be at least  17 billion  this estimate includes costs for installing the new system along tracks upgrading locomotives adding communication equipment and developing new technologies total ptc spending lifetodate through 2012 was approximately  585 million  

in addition to capital investments the company uses cash for scheduled payments of debt and leases share repurchases and to pay dividends to shareholders in 2012 net cash used in financing activities was 668 million  which was a decrease in spending of 745 million  share repurchases were lower by 830 million and partially offsetting this were higher dividend payments of 78 million as a result of an increase in the quarterly dividend to 014 per share in second quarter 2012  

csx corporation 

part ii 

in 2011 net cash used in financing activities was 14 billion which increased 186 million from the prior year primarily as a result of 16 billion of share repurchases partially offset by net debt in 2011 csx paid dividends of 480 million in 2011 which was 108 million more than prior year this increase was due to an increase in the quarterly dividend to 009 per share at the beginning of 2011 and then to 012 in second quarter 2011 

csx is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments csx may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations although new legislation or regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors under item 1a of this form 10k it is too early to predict the manner or severity of such impact 

liquidity and working capital 

currently csx is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint the company ended the year with 14 billion  of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments csx has a 1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks this facility expires in september 2016 and as of the date of this filing the company has no outstanding balances under this facility additionally in 2012 csx issued a total of 11 billion  of new longterm debt csx uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes which may include reduction or refinancing of outstanding indebtedness capital expenditures working capital requirements contributions to the companys qualified pension plan redemptions and repurchases of csx common stock and dividends to shareholders see note 9 debt and credit agreements 

the companys 250 million receivables securitization facility has a 364day term and expires in december 2013  the companys intention is to continue to renew this facility prior to its expiration the purpose of this facility is to provide an alternative to commercial paper and a low cost source of shortterm liquidity under the terms of this facility csxt transfers eligible thirdparty receivables to csx trade receivables a bankruptcyremote special purpose subsidiary a separate subsidiary of csx services the receivables upon transfer the receivables become assets of csx trade receivables and are not available to the creditors of csx or any of its other subsidiaries in the event csx trade receivables draws under this facility the company will record an equivalent amount of debt on its consolidated financial statements as of the date of this filing the company has no outstanding balances under this facility 

working capital can also be considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its shortterm needs csx had a working capital surplus  of 174 million  and 248 million  at december 2012  and 2011  respectively this lower surplus since the prior year is primarily due to reclassification of current portion of longterm debt that will mature within a year this decline was offset by payments made for incentive compensation and other labor and fringe liabilities as well as for shortterm debt paid also see sources and uses of cash description above 

the company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above although the company currently has a surplus a working capital deficit is not unusual for csx or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity the company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due furthermore csx has sufficient financial capacity including its revolving credit facility trade receivable facility and shelf registration statement to manage its daytoday cash requirements and any anticipated obligations the company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity

credit ratings 

  

credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” and moody’s investors service “moody’s” use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa for sp and moody’s respectively a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 

the cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by csxs credit ratings csxs credit ratings have improved during 2012 currently csx is rated bbb with a positive outlook by sp and baa2 with a stable outlook by moodys compared to a rating of bbb with a stable outlook by sp and baa3 with a positive outlook by moodys at december 2011 ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sp and moody’s respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade if csxs credit ratings were to decline to below investment grade levels the company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt in addition a decline in csx’s credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market’s demand and thus the company’s ability to readily issue new debt

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results may differ from those estimates these estimates and assumptions are discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors on a regular basis consistent with the prior year significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas 

 

casualty environmental and legal reserves 

  

casualty 

casualty reserves represent accruals for personal injury occupational injury and asbestos claims during 2010 the company increased its selfinsured retention amount for these claims from 25 million  to 50 million  per occurrence for claims occurring on or after june 1 2010 currently no individual claim is expected to exceed the companys selfinsured retention amount in accordance with the contingencies topic  in the financial accounting standards boards fasb accounting standards codification asc to the extent the value of an individual claim exceeds the selfinsured retention amount the company would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries these reserves fluctuate based upon the timing of payments as well as changes in independent thirdparty estimates which are reviewed by management actual results may vary from estimates due to the number type and severity of the injury costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation 

most of the claims relate to csxt unless otherwise noted below defense and processing costs which historically have been insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future are not included in the recorded liabilities 

as of december 2012  the company had 325 million  in casualty reserves see below for details regarding changes in estimate for casualty reserves

personal injury 

  

personal injury reserves represent liabilities for employee workrelated and thirdparty injuries workrelated injuries for csxt employees are primarily subject to the federal employers’ liability act “fela” in addition to fela liabilities employees of other csx subsidiaries are covered by various state workers’ compensation laws the federal longshore and harbor workers’ compensation program or the maritime jones act 

csxt retains an independent actuarial firm to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims an analysis is performed by the independent actuarial firm quarterly and is reviewed by management the methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims it is based largely on csxts historical claims and settlement experience 

during 2012 and 2011 there were no significant changes in estimates in personal injury reserves adjustments to the reserves are included in materials supplies and other in the consolidated income statements 

occupational  asbestos 

occupational claims arise from allegations of exposures to certain materials in the workplace such as solvents soaps chemicals collectively referred to as “irritants” and diesel fuels from exhaust fumes or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions such as repetitive stress injuries carpal tunnel syndrome and hearing loss 

the company is also party to a number of asbestos claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the workplace the heaviest possible exposure for employees resulted from work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines that were largely phased out beginning around the 1950s other types of exposures however including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials continued until these exposures were substantially eliminated by 1985 additionally the company has retained liability for asbestos claims filed against its previously owned international container shipping business diseases associated with asbestos typically have long latency periods amount of time between exposure to a disease and the onset of the disease which can range from 10 to 40 years  after exposure 

occupational and asbestos claims are analyzed by a thirdparty actuary or specialist the thirdparty specialist respectively in order to determine the number of unasserted or incurred but not reported “ibnr” claims analyses of both types of claims are performed by the thirdparty specialist and reviewed by management this review is quarterly for occupational claims and annually for asbestos claims since exposure to asbestos has been substantially eliminated this review is completed annually for asserted occupational and asbestos claims management reviews quarterly with the exception of carpal tunnel management has determined that seven years is the most probable time period in which unasserted claim filings and claim values can be estimated carpal tunnel claims use a threeyear period to estimate the reserve due to the shorter latency period for these types of injuries 

the thirdparty specialists analyze csxt’s historical claim filings settlement amounts and dismissal rates to determine future anticipated claim filing rates and average settlement values for occupational and asbestos claims reserves the potentially exposed population is estimated by using csx employment records and industry data from this analysis the thirdparty specialists provide an estimate of the ibnr claims liability 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates  continued 

the estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for these reserves a 1  increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of occupational and asbestos ibnr claims or the average claim values would result in approximately a 1 million  increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted occupational and asbestos claims 

during 2012 and 2011 there were no  significant changes in estimates recorded to adjust occupational or asbestos reserves adjustments in reserves are included in materials supplies and other in the consolidated income statements 

environmental 

  

the company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 248  environmentally impaired sites many of these are or may be subject to remedial action under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 or cercla also known as the superfund law or similar state statutes most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations a number of these proceedings however are based on allegations that the company or its predecessors sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment recycling or disposal in addition some of the company’s land holdings were leased to others for commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the company 

in any such proceedings the company is subject to environmental cleanup and enforcement actions under the superfund law as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct these costs could be substantial 

in accordance with the asset retirement and environmental obligations topic  in the asc the company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least quarterly giving consideration to a number of factors such as 

 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates  continued 

as of december 2012  the company had 88 million  in environmental reserves these recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted and include future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs but exclude any anticipated insurance recoveries based on the review process the company has recorded amounts to cover contingent anticipated future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are estimable and probable payments related to these liabilities are expected to be made over the next several years environmental remediation costs are included in materials supplies and other on the consolidated income statements 

currently the company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities if any on some sites until completion of future environmental studies in addition conditions that are currently unknown could at any given location result in additional exposure the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated based upon information currently available however the company believes its environmental reserves are adequate to fund the current remedial actions 

legal 

in accordance with the contingencies topic  in the asc an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated if no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred 

the company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above the amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings newly discovered or developed evidence or changes in laws regulations and evidentiary standards 

see item 3 legal proceedings for further discussion of these items 

pension and postretirement medical plan accounting 

the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried management personnel the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement for employees hired in 2003 or thereafter benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age service and compensation   as of december 2012  the projected benefit obligation for the company’s pension plans was 30 billion  during the first quarter 2012  the company made a contribution of 275 million  to its qualified pension plans of which 25 million  was the required minimum contribution 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates  continued 

in addition to these plans the company sponsors a selfinsured postretirement medical plan and a life insurance plan that provide benefits to fulltime salaried management employees hired prior to january 1 2003 upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met prior to 2011 the postretirement medical plan was partially funded by all participating retirees with retiree contributions adjusted annually beginning in 2011 medicareeligible retirees are covered by a health reimbursement arrangement which is an employerfunded account that can be used for reimbursement of eligible medical expenses nonmedicare eligible retirees continue to be covered by the existing selfinsured program the life insurance plan is noncontributory 

for information related to the funded status of the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans see note 8 employee benefit plans 

  

the accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the compensationretirement benefits topic  in the asc this rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following 

 

the company engages independent external actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the company selects the company reviews the discount rates longterm rate of return on plan assets salary scale inflation rates and other assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends as appropriate 

discount rates 

  

discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component of pension and postretirement expense discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other postretirement benefits could be effectively settled or in other words how much it would cost the company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the companys expected future benefit payments the company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans expected benefit payments 

the discount rates used by the company to value its 2012  pension and postretirement obligations are 375  and 320  respectively for 2011  the discount rate used by the company to value its pension and postretirement obligations was 475  and 425  respectively discount rates may differ for pension and postretirement benefits due to varying duration of the liabilities for projected payments for each plan as of december 2012  the estimated duration of pensions and postretirement benefits is approximately 12  years and 8  years respectively 

each year these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates in general if interest rates decline or rise the assumed discount rates will change 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates  continued 

longterm rate of return on plan assets 

  

the expected longterm average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation in estimating that rate the company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected longterm rate of return on assets as this assumption is longterm it is adjusted less frequently than other assumptions used in pension accounting the longterm rate of return on plan assets used by the company to value its pension obligation was 775  and 8  in 2012  and 2011  respectively 

salary scale inflation rates 

  

salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the company the company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates the company used a salary scale rate of 375  and 4  to value its 2012  and 2011  pension obligations respectively 

other assumptions 

the calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to health care cost trend rates mortality rates turnover and retirement age these assumptions are based upon historical data recent plan experience and industry trends and are selected by management 

2013  estimated pension and postretirement expense 

net pension and postretirement benefits expense for 2013  is expected to be approximately 95 million  and 29 million  respectively compared to 81 million  and 28 million  respectively in 2012  the increase in the pension expense is primarily related to additional amortization of the actuarial losses incurred by the pension plan and the decrease in the discount rate which causes expense to increase partially offset by the return on discretionary contributions made during 2012 

the following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effect of changes in certain assumptions like discount rates salaries and health care costs on the 2012  estimated pension and postretirement expense

depreciation policies for assets utilizing the grouplife method 

the company depreciates its rail assets including mainline track locomotives and freight cars using the grouplife method of accounting assets depreciated under the grouplife method comprise over 85  of total fixed assets of 35 billion  on a gross basis at december 2012  all other assets of the company are depreciated on a straightline basis the grouplife method aggregates assets with similar lives and characteristics into groups and depreciates each of these groups as a whole when using the grouplife method an underlying assumption is that each group of assets as a whole is used and depreciated to the end of its recoverable life 

the company currently utilizes more than 130  different depreciable asset categories to account for depreciation expense for the railroad assets that are depreciated under the grouplife method of accounting examples of depreciable asset categories include 18  different categories for crossties due to the different combinations of density classifications and asset types by utilizing various depreciable categories the company can more accurately account for the use of its assets all assets of the company are depreciated on a time or life basis 

the company believes the grouplife method of depreciation closely approximates the straightline method of depreciation additionally due to the nature of most of its assets eg track is one contiguous connected asset the company believes that this is the most effective way to properly depreciate its assets 

under the grouplife method of accounting the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying managements assumptions regarding the service lives of its properties a depreciation study also referred to as a life study is the periodic review of asset service lives salvage values accumulated depreciation and other related factors for group assets conducted by a thirdparty specialist analyzed by the company’s management and approved by the surface transportation board “stb” the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices the stb requires depreciation studies be performed for equipment assets every three  years and for road eg bridges and signals and track eg rail ties and ballast assets every six  years the company believes the frequency currently required by the stb provides adequate review of asset service lives and that a more frequent review would not result in a material change due to the longlived nature of most of the assets 

changes in asset service lives due to the results of the depreciation studies are applied on a prospective basis and could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense and thus the companys results of operations 

there are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include 

 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates  continued 

for retirements or disposals of depreciable rail assets that occur in the ordinary course of business the asset cost net of salvage value or sales proceeds is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized as individual assets within a specific group are retired resulting gains and losses are recorded in accumulated depreciation as part of the depreciation study an assessment of the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is made to determine if it is deficient or in excess of the appropriate amount indicated by the study any such deficiency or excess including any deferred gains or losses is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service life of the asset group until the next required depreciation study since the overall assumption with grouplife is that the assets within the group on average have the same service life and characteristics it is therefore concluded that the deferred gains and losses offset over time 

in the event that large groups of assets are removed from service as a result of unusual acts or sales resulting gains and losses are recognized immediately these acts are not considered to be in the normal course of business and are therefore recognized when incurred examples of such acts would be the major destruction of assets due to significant storm damage eg major hurricanes the sale of a rail line segment to another railroad or the disposal of an entire class of assets eg disposal of all refrigerated freight cars 

recent experience with depreciation studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes which did not materially affect the company’s annual depreciation expense of 11 billion  and 1 billion  for 2012  and 2011  respectively a 1  change in the average life of all grouplife assets would result in an approximate 10 million  change to the company’s annual depreciation expense in 2012 the company completed a depreciation study for its equipment assets and a technical update an update to the prior depreciation study for its road and track assets additionally in 2009 the company completed a depreciation study for its equipment assets these studies resulted in an annual net reduction in depreciation expense which were not considered material to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

csx accounts for income taxes in accordance with the income taxes topic  in the asc that addresses how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under this topic the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent  likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 

csx files a consolidated federal income tax return which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries examinations of the federal income tax returns of csx have been completed through 2010  the federal income tax return for 2011  currently is under review during 2012  the company participated in a contemporaneous internal revenue service “irs” audit of tax year 2012  management believes an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed while the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty it is the opinion of csx management that none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition results of operations or liquidity of csx an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items however could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year as of december 2012  the company’s uncertain tax positions were 24 million

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

csx does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes historically the company has used derivative financial instruments to address market risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and the risk of volatility in its fuel costs 

at december 2012  csx had 25 million  of floating rate debt obligations outstanding a 1  fluctuation in interest rates on these notes would cause less than a 1 million  change in interest expense this amount was determined by considering the impact of a hypothetical interest rate fluctuation on the balances of our floating rate debt at december 28 2012

see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for operating revenue operating income and total assets for each of the last three fiscal years 

  

company history 

  

a leader in freight rail transportation for more than 180 years the company’s heritage dates back to the early nineteenth century when the baltimore and ohio railroad company “bo” – the nation’s first common carrier – was chartered in 1827 since that time the company has built on this foundation to create a railroad that could safely and reliably service the everincreasing demands of a growing nation 

  

since its founding numerous railroads have combined with the former bo through merger and consolidation to create what has become csx each of the railroads that combined into the csx family brought new geographical reach to valuable markets gateways cities ports and transportation corridors 

  

csx was incorporated in 1978 under virginia law in 1980 the company completed the merger of the chessie system and seaboard coast line industries into csx the merger allowed the company to connect northern population centers and appalachian coal fields to growing southeastern markets later the company’s acquisition of key portions of conrail inc allowed csxt to link the northeast including new england and the new york metropolitan area with chicago and midwestern markets as well as the growing areas in the southeast already served by csxt this current rail network allows the company to directly serve every major market in the eastern united states with safe dependable environmentally responsible and fuel efficient freight transportation and intermodal service 

  

competition 

  

the business environment in which the company operates is highly competitive shippers typically select transportation providers that offer the most compelling combination of service and price service requirements both in terms of transit time and reliability vary by shipper and commodity as a result the company’s primary competition varies by commodity geographic location and mode of available transportation 

  

csx corporation

csxt’s primary rail competitor is norfolk southern railway which operates throughout much of the company’s territory other railroads also operate in parts of the company’s territory depending on the specific market competing railroads and deregulated motor carriers may exert pressure on price and service levels for further discussion on the risk of competition to the company see item 1a risk factors 

  

regulatory environment 

the companys operations are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses in the united states the railroad operations conducted by the companys subsidiaries which includes csxt are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the surface transportation board “stb” the federal railroad administration “fra” and its sister agency within the us department of transportation the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration “phmsa” together fra and phmsa have broad jurisdiction over railroad operating standards and practices including track freight cars locomotives and hazardous materials requirements additionally the transportation security administration “tsa” a component of the department of homeland security has broad authority over railroad operating practices that may have homeland security implications 

    

although the staggers act of 1980 significantly deregulated rail rates and much of the rail traffic of the companys subsidiaries is currently exempt from rate regulation by agency decision the stb has broad jurisdiction over railroad commercial practices including some railroad rates routes fuel surcharges conditions of services and the extension or abandonment of rail lines this includes jurisdiction over freight car charges the transfer extension or abandonment of rail lines rates charged on certain regulated rail traffic conditions of service and any acquisition of control over rail common carriers 

    

in 2008 congress enacted the rail safety improvement act the “rsia” the legislation includes a mandate that all class i freight railroads implement a positive train control system “ptc” by december 31 2015 the aar recently advised the fra on behalf of the industry that a nationwide interoperable ptc network cannot be completed by the december 31 2015 deadline federal legislation introduced in both the house of representatives and the senate would if approved delay the final implementation of ptc from three to five years 

ptc must be installed on all main lines with passenger and commuter operations as well as most of those over which toxicbyinhalation hazardous materials are transported implementation of a ptc system is designed to prevent traintotrain collisions overspeed derailments incursions into established workzone limits and train diversions onto another set of tracks caused by switches left in wrong positions the company expects to incur significant capital costs in connection with the implementation of ptc as well as related ongoing operating expenses csx previously estimated that the total multiyear cost of ptc implementation would be at least 12 billion  for the company this estimate is currently being reevaluated due to upward pressure on these costs 

  

in december 2009 a proposed bill called the “surface transportation board reauthorization act of 2009” was introduced in the senate but not advanced in january 2011 the bill now referred to as the surface transportation board reauthorization act of 2011 “stb reauthorization bill” was reintroduced the stb reauthorization bill if adopted could increase government involvement in railroad pricing service and operations the proposed legislation also includes provisions that would reduce a railroads ability to price at market levels and open a carriers privatelyowned and maintained rail network to competitors under certain conditions though unlikely portions of the stb reauthorization bill may be considered as part of the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act a bill to reauthorize federalaid highway and highway safety construction programs and for other purposes 

     

csx corporation 

part i 

if adopted as proposed this bill could have a material adverse effect on the companys revenue and operations as well as its ability to invest in enhancing and maintaining vital infrastructure prior to the reintroduction of the stb reauthorization bill the stb had already announced two new hearings one held in february 2011 to review the utility of boxcar intermodal automotive and other exemptions and the other held in june 2011 to explore the current state of competition in the railroad industry the stb has not yet announced what actions if any it will take in response to the records developed in these hearings

 item 1a risk factors 

  

the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the companys forwardlooking statements additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the company or that the company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

csx corporation 

part i 

new legislation or regulatory changes could impact the companys earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices 

  

legislation passed by congress or new regulations issued by federal agencies can significantly affect the revenues costs and profitability of the companys business for instance legislation proposed in the senate in december 2009 and reintroduced in january 2011 see regulatory environment in part i for further details if adopted could significantly change the federal regulatory framework of the railroad industry several of the changes under consideration could have a significant negative impact on the companys ability to determine prices for rail services and meet service standards which could force a reduction in capital spending in addition statutes imposing price constraints or affecting railtorail competition could adversely affect the companys profitability 

  

government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the companys operations and financial results 

  

the company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies including the stb the fra and other state and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic health safety labor environmental tax legal and other matters new rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the companys operating costs or reduce operating efficiencies for example the rsia mandated that the installation of ptc be completed by december 31 2015 on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that have commuter or passenger operations in january 2010 the fra issued its final rule on the design operational requirements and implementation of the new ptc technology the fra is now reexamining certain aspects of the rule in response to rail industry concerns the aar recently advised the fra on behalf of the industry that a nationwide interoperable ptc network cannot be completed by the december 31 2015 deadline federal legislation introduced in both the house of representatives and the senate would if approved delay the final implementation of ptc from three to five years even if revised the rule will continue to impose significant new costs on the company and the rail industry noncompliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the company and can subject the company to fines penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions 

  

climate change legislation and regulation could adversely affect the companys operations and financial results 

  

climate change legislation or regulation has been proposed and in some cases adopted on the federal state provincial canada and local levels these final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions caps taxes or other controls on greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions in particular the us environmental protection agency “epa” has issued various regulations targeting ghg emissions including rules and standards governing ghg emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles 

any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations could adversely affect csx operations and financial results by among other things 1 increasing energy costs generally making it difficult for the companys customers in the us and canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner particularly in the absence of similar regulations in countries like india and china 2 increasing the companys fuel capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies 3 reducing coalfired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards which csx considers to be unachievable within the time frames ordered by the us epa and 4 reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the united states any of these factors could reduce the amount of traffic the company handles and have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

csx corporation 

part i 

capacity constraints could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency 

  

csxt may experience rail network difficulties related to i increased passenger activities including highspeed rail in capacityconstrained areas or ii regulatory changes impacting when   csxt can transport freight or service routes that could have a negative effect on csxts operational fluidity leading to deterioration of service asset utilization and overall efficiency 

  

general economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight 

  

the economic recession in late 2008 and 2009 adversely affected demand for rail and intermodal services although overall traffic improved in 2010 and 2011 a decline in general domestic and global economic conditions that affect demand for the commodities the company carries could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects in addition if the rate of economic growth in china slows or if european economies contract us export coal volume could be adversely impacted resulting in lower revenue for csx furthermore sustained low natural gas prices are having a negative impact on domestic coal volume as coalfired electricity generation is being displaced by natural gasfired generation which could adversely impact the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

csxt as a common carrier by rail is required by law to transport hazardous materials which could expose the company to significant costs and claims 

  

under federal regulations csxt is required to transport hazardous materials under its common carrier obligation a train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury property or natural resource damage environmental penalties and remediation obligations such claims if insured could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates 

csxt is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials in november 2008 the tsa issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail noncompliance with these rules can subject the company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident finally legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances which could increase operating costs reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials 

  

the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs 

the company is subject to wideranging federal state provincial canada and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions into the air ground and water the handling storage use generation transportation and disposal of waste and other materials the cleanup of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees if we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which we are responsible in certain circumstances environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties leased properties adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or company predecessors as well as to properties currently owned leased or used by the company 

  

csx corporation 

part i 

the company has been and may in the future be subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated or is strictly liable under environmental laws or regulations and such violations can result in the companys incurring fines penalties or costs relating to the cleanup of environmental contamination although the company believes it has appropriately recorded current and longterm liabilities for known and estimable future environmental costs it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing the company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination 

  

the company relies on the stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business 

  

the company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business the performance and reliability of the companys technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively    a cybersecurity attack which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems or other significant disruption or failure could result in a service interruption train accident misappropriation of confidential information process failure security breach or other operational difficulties such an event could result in increased capital insurance or operating costs including increased security costs to protect the companys infrastructure disruption of the companys information technology systems even for short periods of time could have a material adverse effect on the company 

disruption of the supply chain could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs 

  

the capital intensive nature and sophistication of core rail equipment including rolling stock equipment locomotives rail and ties limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers if any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage csxt could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage in addition a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and as such adverse developments in international relations new trade regulations disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase csxts operating costs 

  

additionally if a fuel supply shortage were to arise whether due to the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec other production restrictions lower refinery outputs a disruption of oil imports adverse political developments or otherwise the company would be negatively impacted 

  

failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes andor work stoppages 

  

most of csxs employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements the majority of these agreements are bargained nationally by the national carriers conference committee and negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages under the railway labor acts procedures which include mediation coolingoff periods and the possibility of presidential intervention during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted if however csx is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements or if terms of existing agreements are disputed the employees covered by the railway labor act could strike which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members 

csx corporation 

part i 

the company faces competition from other transportation providers 

  

the company experiences competition in the form of pricing service reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and to a less significant extent barges ships and pipelines transportation providers such as motor carriers and barges utilize public rightsofway that are built and maintained by governmental entities while csxt and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks could negatively impact the companys competitive position 

  

future acts of terrorism war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the companys operations 

  

terrorist attacks along with any government response to those attacks may adversely affect the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity csxts rail lines or other key infrastructure may be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war this risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues in addition premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the company could increase dramatically or the coverage may no longer be available 

  

furthermore in response to the heightened risk of terrorism federal state and local governmental bodies are proposing and in some cases have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry for example the department of homeland security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials complying with these regulations could continue to increase the companys operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies 

severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage 

  

the companys operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences including floods fires hurricanes and earthquakes as a result the companys rail network may be damaged its workforce may be unavailable fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur in addition the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions insurance maintained by the company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations depending on the nature of the risk insured this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the companys damages or damages to others and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates even with insurance if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service the company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations 

  

the company may be subject to lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures 

  

the company is subject to various claims and lawsuits including putative class action litigation alleging violations of antitrust laws the company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits additionally existing litigation may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in the companys reserve estimates as the ultimate outcome of existing litigation is subject to numerous factors outside of the companys control final judgments or settlement amounts may differ materially from the recorded reserves 

csx corporation 

part i 

increases in the number and magnitude of property damage and personal injury claims could adversely affect the companys operating results 

  

the company faces inherent business risk from exposure to occupational and personal injury claims property damage including storm damage and claims related to train accidents the company may incur significant costs to defend such claims 

  

existing claims may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in reserve estimates as the ultimate outcome of existing claims is subject to numerous factors outside of the companys control although the company establishes reserves and maintains insurance to cover these types of claims final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may differ materially from the recorded reserves and exceed the companys insurance coverage

csxt’s track structure includes main thoroughfares connecting terminals and yards known as mainline track track within terminals and switching yards track adjacent to the mainlines used for passing trains track connecting the mainline track to customer locations and track that diverts trains from one track to another known as turnouts total track miles are greater than csxt’s approximately 21000  route miles which reflect the size of csxt’s network that connects markets customers and western railroads at december 2011  the breakdown of track miles was as follows 



in addition to its physical track structure csxt operates numerous yards and terminals these serve as the hubs between csxt and its local customers and as sorting facilities where rail cars often are received resorted and placed onto new outbound trains 

  

the company’s ten largest yards and terminals based on annual volume number of rail cars or intermodal containers processed are listed below

network geography 

  

csxt’s operations are primarily focused on four major transportation networks and corridors which are defined geographically and by commodity flows below 

interstate 90 i90 corridor  – this csxt corridor links chicago and the midwest to metropolitan areas in new york and new england this route also known as the “waterlevel route” has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks referred to as double track these superior engineering attributes permit the corridor to support consistent highspeed intermodal automotive and merchandise service this corridor is a primary route for import traffic coming from the far east through western ports moving eastward across the country through chicago and into the population centers in the northeast the i90 corridor is also a critical link between ports in new york new jersey and pennsylvania and consumption markets in the midwest this route carries consumer goods from all three of the company’s major markets – merchandise coal and intermodal 

interstate 95 i95 corridor  – the csxt i95 corridor connects charleston jacksonville miami and many other cities throughout the southeast with the heavily populated northeastern cities of baltimore philadelphia and new york csxt primarily transports food and consumer products as well as metals and chemicals along this line it is the only rail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of the district of columbia and provides access to major eastern ports 

southeastern corridor  – this critical part of the network runs between csxt’s western gateways of chicago st louis and memphis through the cities of nashville birmingham and atlanta and markets in the southeast the southeastern corridor is the premier rail route connecting these key cities gateways and markets and positions csxt to efficiently handle projected traffic volumes of intermodal automotive and general merchandise traffic the corridor also provides direct rail service between the coal reserves of the southern illinois basin and the demand for coal in the southeast 

coal network   – the csxt coal network connects the coal mining operations in the appalachian mountain region and illinois basin with industrial areas in the northeast and midatlantic as well as many river lake and deep water port facilities csxt’s coal network is well positioned to supply utility markets in both the northeast and southeast and to transport coal shipments for exports outside of the us roughly one of every three  tons of export coal and nearly all  of the domestic coal that the company transports is used for generating electricity

 item 3 legal proceedings 

fuel surcharge antitrust litigation 

class action lawsuits first filed in may 2007 have been consolidated and are pending in federal court in the district of columbia against csxt and three other usbased class i railroads the court has not yet ruled on whether it is appropriate to certify the case as a class action 

the lawsuits contain substantially similar allegations to the effect that the defendants fuel surcharge practices relating to contract and unregulated traffic resulted from an illegal conspiracy in violation of antitrust laws the suits seek unquantified treble damages three times the amount of actual damages allegedly sustained by purported class members attorneys fees and other relief 

all but three of the lawsuits purport to be filed on behalf of a class of shippers that allegedly purchased rail freight transportation services from the defendants through the use of contracts or through other means exempt from rate regulation during defined periods commencing as early as june 2003 and that were assessed fuel surcharges three of the lawsuits purport to be on behalf of indirect purchasers of rail services the court denied the defendants motion to dismiss the direct purchasers claims the court dismissed all of the indirect purchasers causes of action seeking money damages but did not dismiss their request for injunctive relief the dismissal was upheld on appeal plaintiffs then petitioned the united states supreme court to hear the case the supreme court denied the petition in december 2010 

one additional lawsuit was filed but not served by an individual shipper csxt entered into a tolling agreement with this shipper whereby the shipper agreed to dismiss the lawsuit against csxt without prejudice and csxt agreed to extend the statute of limitations for the claims asserted until the end of 2010 that agreement has been extended to the end of 2012 

csx corporation 

part i 

csxt believes that its fuel surcharge practices are lawful accordingly csxt intends to vigorously defend itself against the purported class actions which it believes are without merit while csxt cannot predict the outcome of the private lawsuits or of any government investigations charges or additional litigation that may be filed in the future we currently believe that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on any of our results of operations financial condition and liquidity penalties for violating antitrust laws can be severe involving both potential criminal and civil liability if a material adverse outcome were to occur and be sustained it could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

other legal proceedings 

  

in addition to the matters described above the company is involved in litigation incidental to its business and is a party to a number of legal actions and claims various governmental proceedings and private civil lawsuits including but not limited to those related to environmental and hazardous material exposure matters fela claims by employees other personal injury claims and disputes and complaints involving certain transportation rates and charges some of the legal proceedings include claims for compensatory as well as punitive damages and others are or are purported to be class actions while the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty considering among other things the legal defenses available and liabilities that have been recorded along with applicable insurance it is currently the opinion of csx management that none of these pending items will have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items however could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity in that particular period

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

strategic overview 

csx provides railbased freight transportation services including traditional rail service and the transport of intermodal containers and trailers the company and the rail industry provide customers with access to an expansive and interconnected transportation network that plays a key role in north american commerce and is critical to the economic success and global competitiveness of the united states america is once again poised for a period of growth in manufacturing as the economy continues to recover the us demand to move more goods by rail is expected to rise along with the need to reduce highway congestion and greenhouse gas emissions csx and freight railroads are the best way to meet this demand while reducing environmental impacts csx can move a ton of freight almost 500 miles on one gallon of fuel and on average over three times more fuel efficiently than trucks 

csxs network is positioned to reach nearly twothirds of americans who account for the majority of the nations consumption of goods through this network the company transports a diverse portfolio of products and commodities to meet the countrys needs these products range from energy sources like coal and ethanol to automobiles chemicals building materials paper metals grains and consumer products   the company categorizes these products into three primary lines of business merchandise coal and intermodal csxs transportation solutions connect industries across the united states with each other and with global markets to meet the transportation needs of port facilities energy producers manufacturers industrial producers construction companies farmers and feed mills wholesalers and retailers and the united states armed forces 

csx services are delivered by dedicated employees whose jobs cannot be exported overseas railroad jobs are among some of the nations highest paying in 2011 csx continued its job creation efforts by hiring more than 4000 new employees that will carry forward with this legacy 

strategic growth initiatives 

as csx continues to strengthen its core business the company is focusing on three key strategic growth initiatives related to intermodal export coal and total service integration the company believes these initiatives will allow it to capture additional domestic and international volume while improving service offerings to its customers in a costeffective manner 

the companys intermodal business is an economical environmentallyfriendly alternative to transporting freight on highways via truck csx is capitalizing on this opportunity by building new terminals and increasing network capacity construction of a new intermodal terminal in louisville kentucky and major terminal expansion projects such as the worcester massachusetts and columbus ohio terminals are currently underway these investments are in addition to the companys new northwest ohio intermodal terminal that became operational during first quarter 2011 this highcapacity terminal which is part of csxs national gateway initiative discussed below expands service offerings to customers as well as improves market access to and from east coast ports 

rapid economic growth in developing countries such as india china and brazil has generated a long term growth cycle in export coal demand as a result of the increase in global steel production demand for us coal is expected to remain strong demand for coal used in electric power generation is also expected to remain high due to rising consumption as developing countries become more urbanized these increases in global coal demand are expected to largely be met by export shipments with a considerable portion originating from the us the company is wellpositioned to capitalize on this market growth through its network access to large us coal suppliers and multiple port facilities 

csx corporation 

part ii 

csxs total service integration “tsi” initiative which was launched in 2006 supports growth by improving service optimizing train size and increasing asset utilization for unit train shipments from origin to destination csx is now advancing this initiative to enhance service quality for customers who ship by the carload this program tsi carload focuses where the customer is impacted most  during the first and last mile of service these enhancements aim to improve service levels and reliability of rail transportation over other modes of transportation these improvements to operational processes customer communication and service will better align the companys operating capabilities with customers needs 

balanced approach to capital deployment 

csx remains highly committed to delivering value to shareholders through a balanced approach to deploying capital that includes investments in infrastructure dividend growth and share repurchases in 2011 the company invested 23 billion to further enhance the capacity quality safety and flexibility of its network included in this amount is approximately 100 million of investments related to reimbursable publicprivate partnerships where reimbursements may not be fully received in a given year in addition csx continues to return value to its shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases the company has increased its quarterly cash dividend nine times over the last six year period which represents a 36 percent compounded annual growth rate also during 2011 csx announced a new 2 billion share repurchase authority expected to be completed by the end of 2012 based on market and business conditions 

publicprivate partnerships 

expanding capacity on us rail networks will provide substantial public benefits including job creation increased business activity at us ports reduced highway congestion and lower air emissions therefore csx and its government partners are working jointly to invest in multiyear rail infrastructure projects such as the national gateway this initiative is a publicprivate partnership which will increase intermodal capacity on key corridors between midatlantic ports and the midwest current projects related to the national gateway include the expansion of the virginia avenue tunnel in washington dc and construction for doublestack train clearances in ohio west virginia pennsylvania maryland and the district of columbia 

csx is engaged in another major partnership initiative with the commonwealth of massachusetts to expand freight and commuter rail service currently csx provides service to and from new england to further improve that service offering to customers csx is expanding its intermodal terminal footprint in worcester massachusetts and with the commonwealth is clearing the route from worcester to the new york state line for doublestack intermodal service 

additionally csx has entered into a transaction with the state of florida to help alleviate highway congestion through a new commuter rail operation known as sunrail csx sold the state a portion of its track for its new commuter rail and will invest the proceeds in additional freight rail capacity and infrastructure within the state this includes a new automotive and intermodal facility in central florida 

in summary these longterm investments discussed above provide a foundation for volume growth and productivity improvement enhanced customer service and continued advancements in the safety and reliability of operations to continue these types of investments the company must be able to operate in an environment in which it can generate adequate returns and drive shareholder value csx will continue to advocate for a fair and balanced regulatory environment to ensure that the value of the companys rail service would be reflected in any potential new legislation or policies

2011  highlights 

 

 

 



in 2011  the company achieved positive yearoveryear volume and revenue results as demand for rail service in the markets csx serves continued to support profitable growth revenue increased   10  from prior year to 117 billion  with growth in all three major markets  merchandise coal and intermodal ongoing emphasis on pricing above rail inflation along with higher fuel recovery associated with the increase in fuel prices drove revenueperunit increases in all markets 

expenses increased  by 760 million  or 10  from prior year this increase was driven primarily by higher fuel prices inflation and other laborrelated costs associated with increased resource levels and training costs focused on service improvements although expenses increased yearoveryear csx was able to achieve a record operating ratio of 709  due to the companys continued focus on cost control and strong top line growth fiscal year 2010 results include an extra week of activity as compared to fiscal year 2011 this activity did not have a material impact on the companys full year 2010 results of operations

in addition to the financial highlights described above the company measures and reports safety and service performance the company strives for continuous improvement in these measures through training initiatives and investment for example the companys safety and train accident prevention programs rely on broad employee involvement the programs utilize operating rules training compliance measurement root cause analysis and communication that are intended to create a safer environment for employees and the public continued capital investment in the companys assets including track bridges signals equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance 

the company routinely collaborates with the fra and industry organizations as well as federal state and local governments on the development and implementation of safety programs and initiatives for example csx operation lifesaver inc the us department of transportation and other major railroads from across the country have partnered in the common sense campaign to reduce the number of injuries and deaths around tracks and trains in addition to these initiatives csxt also has an ongoing public safety program to clearcut trees and vegetation at public passive highwayrail intersections crossings with no flashing lights or gates to improve the publics ability to discern rail hazards 

 during 2011 the companys safety metrics improved for 2011 the federal railroad administration “fra” personal injury rate improved 10 to 091 compared to 101 in 2010 this is a record full year personal injury performance for csx the 2011 reported fra train accident frequency rate improved 14 to 232 compared to 269 in 2010 these improvements were achieved through a sustained commitment to safety 

key service measures in 2011 slightly declined as the impact of severe weather on first half 2011 operations were partially offset by improvements gained from additional resources added in the second half of 2011 ontime train originations declined to 72 from 75 in 2010 while ontime arrivals declined to 62 from 69 in 2010 dwell time increased to 259 hours from 250 hours in 2010 average train velocity declined 2 to 206 miles per hour while these key measures declined on a yearoveryear basis fourth quarter 2011 measures were markedly improved and continue to support efficient and reliable train operations for csxs customers

volume and revenue 

  

merchandise 

  

agricultural 

agricultural products  – volume declined as the amount of feed shipments declined as a result of higher corn prices and decreased production from producers of poultry and pork these reductions were slightly offset by growth in ethanol and increased shipments of soybeans into the southeast due to low inventories 

  

phosphates and fertilizers  – shipments of domestic fertilizers grew as farmers replenished inventories to improve crop yields as a result of higher anticipated crop prices export demand was also strong with recovery in exports to central and south america after last years drought shipments of phosphate rock which is used to make fertilizer grew as suppliers are stocking up in anticipation of a strong spring season 

food and consumer  – volume decreased as lower appliance shipments resulting from continued weakness in the housing sector was partially offset by strength in truckload conversions of refrigerated products and manufactured goods 

industrial 

chemicals  – volume was flat as strength in frac sand used in the extraction of gas and petroleum resulted from the increase in natural gas drilling this increase was offset by a reduction in basic chemical markets like plastics which experienced weak consumer demand and inventory destocking 

automotive   automotive volume grew as north american automotive production increased to meet pent up demand from delayed purchases during the slowed economy over the last few years 

metals  – volume growth was driven by strong export demand for scrap shipments and higher domestic steel production resulting from strong demand in the automotive and oil and gas sectors for products such as sheet steel and pipe 

housing and construction 

emerging markets  – volume increased primarily driven by improved shipments of aggregates which include crushed stone sand and gravel cement and waste such as construction and demolition debris as a result of new distribution facilities and overall market growth related to the improving economy 

forest products  – volume increased despite the weakness in housingrelated markets primarily related to strength in shipments of pulp board and paper used in packaging for consumer products and increased shipments of building products resulting from inventory replenishments 

csx corporation 

part ii 

coal 

shipments of utility coal declined as electrical generation declined in the eastern us natural gas prices remained low and utility stockpiles were above target levels this decrease was partially offset by higher export shipments driven by greater demand for us coal in europe south america and asia during 2011 csx shipped 402 million tons of export coal    the increase in revenue per unit was driven by improved yield positive mix and fuel recovery 

intermodal 

  

international and domestic shipment growth resulted from expanded service offerings overtheroad conversions and service and network enhancements the increase in revenue per unit was driven by increased fuel recovery improved yields and favorable traffic mix this revenueperunit increase was partially offset by the impact of switching from a purchased transportation arrangement to a domestic interline program in the prior year this program known as umax provides customers with containers for local shipments or transcontinental service provided jointly by csx and union pacific corporation 

other 

  

other revenue increased due to stronger affiliate revenue and higher incidental charges mostly offset by lower benefits for contract volume commitments as compared to the prior year

fuel  expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as nonlocomotive fuel this expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel fuel expense increased 456 million primarily due to a 26 increase in average price per gallon for locomotive fuel average fuel price per gallon increased 080 from 226 in 2010 to 306 in 2011 

depreciation  expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of a capital asset such as locomotives railcars and track structure over its useful life this expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year depreciation expense increased 29 million due to a larger asset base related to higher capital spending partially offset by a multiyear adjustment related to retirements as well as the impact of prior years additional expense related to the extra week 

equipment and other  includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies net of rents received by csxt for use of its equipment this category of expenses also includes lease expenses for locomotives railcars containers and trailers office and other rentals these expenses increased 5 million primarily due to volumerelated expenses partially offset by cost savings associated with improved asset utilization 

other 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased 5 million to 552 million primarily due to lower average interest rates offset by higher average debt balances during 2011

volume and revenue 

  

merchandise 

  

agricultural 

agricultural products  – volume grew with increased shipments of feed grains and ethanol shipments of feed grains improved with expanded meat production and lower wheat imports ethanol shipments grew as the amount of ethanol in fuel continued to increase 

phosphates and fertilizers  – volume increased as a result of strength in demand for domestic fertilizers due to a strong planting season and due to replenishment of low inventories 

food and consumer  – volume increased slightly as strength in refrigerated products primarily fruits and vegetables and alcoholic beverages were partially offset by weakness in demand for appliances 

industrial 

chemicals  – growth occurred across most markets reflecting improvement in demand for intermediate products used in manufacturing automobiles and consumer goods many plastics and chemicals are key inputs in the production of both durable and nondurable goods as well as packaging 

automotive  – strong growth was driven by an increase in north american lightvehicle production in response to increased demand in the improving economy 

  

metals  – volume growth was driven by increased shipments of sheet steel for auto production increases in scrap steel resulting from higher steel production and increases in energyrelated products 

housing and construction 

emerging markets  – shipments increased in limestone transportation equipment and aggregates which include crushed stone sand and gravel as a result of overall market growth due to the improving economy

coal 

volume was basically flat as increased export shipments were offset by weakness in utility shipments higher export shipments were due to greater demand for us metallurgical coal in asia and steam coal in europe shipments to utility customers were down as high utility stockpiles were reduced throughout the year and are approaching targeted levels the increase in revenue per unit was driven by improved yield higher fuel recovery and longer length of haul 

intermodal 

  

international and domestic shipment growth resulted from us inventory replenishment improved us exports new business truckload conversions and new umax and doortodoor service offerings 

the revenueperunit decline was driven by the impact of switching from a purchased transportation arrangement to a domestic interline program at the start of second quarter this program known as umax provides customers with containers for local shipments or transcontinental service provided jointly by csx and union pacific corporation this revenueperunit decline was partly offset by increased fuel recovery and an improved pricing environment

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures including those to implement regulatory and legislative initiatives in order to have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity its balance sheet sources and uses of cash flow and external factors should be reviewed 

material changes in the consolidated balance sheets and significant cash flows 

consolidated balance sheets 

csxs balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of csxs balanced approach in deploying its capital for the benefit of its shareholders which includes investments in infrastructure dividend improvement and share repurchases 

total assets increased 13 billion from prior year assets increased primarily due to the increase in net properties of 12 billion from planned capital spending as well as shortterm investments grew 469 million these increases were partially offset by the decrease in cash of 509 million 

total liabilities and shareholders equity combined increased 13 billion primarily due to the net increase in total debt of 577 million mostly due to additional borrowings deferred income tax liability also increased by 548 million primarily related to the net impact of bonus depreciation on tax accruals shareholders equity decreased by 232 million as a result of 16 billion of share repurchases since december 2010 partially offset by increased earnings during 2011 

sources of cash 

the company has multiple sources of cash first the company generates cash from operations in 2011  the company generated 35 billion  of cash from operating activities which represented a 230 million   increase  from prior year this increase  was primarily driven by higher earnings in 2011  second csx has access to numerous financing sources including a 1 billion fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in september 2016 as of the date of this filing the company has no outstanding balances under this facility see note 9 debt and credit agreements for more information 

csx filed its shelf registration statement with the sec in february 2010 this shelf registration statement is unlimited as to amount and may be used subject to market conditions and csx board authorization to issue debt or equity securities at csx’s discretion while csx seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit csx to sell such debt securities on acceptable terms at any given time or at all 

csx corporation 

part ii 

uses of cash 

csx continued to invest in its business to create longterm value for shareholders in 2011  net cash used in investing activities was driven by 23 billion  of property additions which increased   457 million  from prior year the company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for longterm growth through expanding network and terminal capacity funds used for property additions are further described below 



 

in addition to capital investments the company uses cash for scheduled payments of debt and leases and to pay dividends to shareholders csx paid dividends of 480 million  in 2011  which was 108 million  more than prior year this increase was due to an increase in the quarterly dividend to 009 per share at the beginning of 2011  and then to 012 in second quarter 2011  net cash used in financing activities was 14 billion  which increased 186 million  primarily as a result of 16 billion of share repurchases partially offset by net debt in 2011  

csx is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments csx may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations although new legislation or regulations such as the stb reauthorization bill or climate change legislation could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors under item 1a of this form 10k it is too early to predict the manner or severity of such impact 

csx corporation

liquidity and working capital 

currently csx is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint the company ended the year with over 13 billion  of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments csx also replaced its existing credit facility that was set to expire in may 2012 with a new 1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks this facility expires in september 2016 the company has no outstanding balances under this facility as of the date of this filing additionally in 2011 csx issued a total of 12 billion of new longterm debt csx uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes which may include capital expenditures working capital requirements improvements in productivity dividends to shareholders debt repayments and repurchases of csx common stock see note 9 debt and credit agreements 

the companys 250 million receivables securitization facility has a 364day term and expires in december 2012  the company plans to renew this facility prior to its expiration the purpose of this facility is to provide an alternative to commercial paper and a low cost source of shortterm liquidity as of the date of this filing the company has no outstanding balances under this facility under the terms of this facility csxt transfers eligible thirdparty receivables to csx trade receivables a bankruptcyremote special purpose subsidiary a separate subsidiary of csx services the receivables upon transfer the receivables become assets of csx trade receivables and are not available to the creditors of csx or any of its other subsidiaries in the event csx trade receivables draws under this facility the company will record an equivalent amount of debt on its consolidated financial statements 

working capital can also be considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its shortterm needs csx had a working capital surplus  of 248 million  and 318 million  at december 2011  and 2010  respectively this lower surplus since the prior year is primarily due to a deferred gain included in current liabilities see sources and uses of cash description above 

the company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above although the company currently has a surplus a working capital deficit is not unusual for csx or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity the company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due furthermore csx has sufficient financial capacity including its revolving credit facility trade receivable facility and shelf registration statement to manage its daytoday cash requirements and any anticipated obligations the company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity 

credit ratings 

  

credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” and moody’s investors service “moody’s” use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa for sp and moody’s respectively a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 

currently csx is rated bbb with a stable outlook by sp and baa3 with a positive outlook by moodys ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sp and moody’s respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade if csxs credit ratings were to decline to lower levels the company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt in addition a decline in csx’s credit ratings could adversely affect the market’s demand and thus the company’s ability to readily issue new debt

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results may differ from those estimates these estimates and assumptions are discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors on a regular basis consistent with the prior year significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas 

 

casualty environmental and legal reserves 

  

casualty 

casualty reserves represent accruals for personal injury occupational injury and asbestos claims during 2010 the company increased its selfinsured retention amount for these claims from 25 million  to 50 million  per injury for claims occurring on or after june 1 2010 currently no individual claim is expected to exceed the companys selfinsured retention amount in accordance with the contingencies topic  in the financial accounting standards boards fasb accounting standards codification asc to the extent the value of an individual claim exceeds the selfinsured retention amount the company would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries these reserves fluctuate based upon the timing of payments as well as changes in independent thirdparty estimates which are reviewed by management actual results may vary from estimates due to the number type and severity of the injury costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation 

most of the claims relate to csxt unless otherwise noted below defense and processing costs which historically have been insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future are not included in the recorded liabilities 

as of december 2011  the company had 372 million  in casualty reserves see below for details regarding changes in estimate for casualty reserves 

personal injury 

  

personal injury reserves represent liabilities for employee workrelated and thirdparty injuries workrelated injuries for csxt employees are primarily subject to the federal employers’ liability act “fela” in addition to fela liabilities employees of other csx subsidiaries are covered by various state workers’ compensation laws the federal longshore and harbor workers’ compensation program or the maritime jones act 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates  continued 

csxt retains an independent actuarial firm to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims an analysis is performed by the independent actuarial firm quarterly and is reviewed by management the methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims it is based largely on csxts historical claims and settlement experience 

during 2011 there were no significant changes in estimates in personal injury reserves during 2010 the company reduced personal injury reserves by 24 million due to a downward trend in the number of injuries this downward trend was measured by the reduction of the csxts federal railroad administration “fra” personal injury rate adjustments to the reserves are included in materials supplies and other in the consolidated income statements 

occupational  asbestos 

occupational claims arise from allegations of exposures to certain materials in the workplace such as solvents soaps chemicals collectively referred to as “irritants” and diesel fuels from exhaust fumes or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions such as repetitive stress injuries carpal tunnel syndrome and hearing loss 

the company is also party to a number of asbestos claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the workplace the heaviest possible exposure for employees resulted from work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines that were largely phased out beginning around the 1950s other types of exposures however including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials continued until these exposures were substantially eliminated by 1985 additionally the company has retained liability for asbestos claims filed against its previously owned international container shipping business diseases associated with asbestos typically have long latency periods amount of time between exposure to a disease and the onset of the disease which can range from 10 to 40 years  after exposure 

occupational and asbestos claims are analyzed by a thirdparty actuary or specialist the thirdparty specialist respectively in order to determine the number of unasserted or incurred but not reported “ibnr” claims analyses of both types of claims are performed by the thirdparty specialist and reviewed by management this review is quarterly for occupational claims and annually for asbestos claims since exposure to asbestos has been substantially eliminated this review is completed annually for asserted occupational and asbestos claims management reviews quarterly with the exception of carpal tunnel management has determined that seven years is the most probable time period in which unasserted claim filings and claim values can be estimated carpal tunnel claims use a threeyear period to estimate the reserve due to the shorter latency period for these types of injuries 

the thirdparty specialists analyze csxt’s historical claim filings settlement amounts and dismissal rates to determine future anticipated claim filing rates and average settlement values for occupational and asbestos claims reserves the potentially exposed population is estimated by using csx employment records and industry data from this analysis the thirdparty specialists provide an estimate of the ibnr claims liability 

the estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for these reserves a 1  increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of occupational and asbestos ibnr claims or the average claim values would result in approximately a 1 million  increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted occupational and asbestos claims

critical accounting estimates  continued 

during 2011 there were no  significant changes in estimate recorded to adjust occupational or asbestos reserves during 2010 the company reduced occupational reserves by 12 million  primarily attributable to a decrease in the number of repetitive stress injury claims and lower settlement values for irritant claims also during 2010  the company reduced its reserves for asbestos claims by 13 million  primarily related to a significant number of claims that were determined to have no value due to lack of sufficient medical evidence adjustments in reserves are included in materials supplies and other in the consolidated income statements 

environmental 

  

the company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 246  environmentally impaired sites many of these are or may be subject to remedial action under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 or cercla also known as the superfund law or similar state statutes most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations a number of these proceedings however are based on allegations that the company or its predecessors sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment recycling or disposal in addition some of the company’s land holdings were leased to others for commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the company 

in any such proceedings the company is subject to environmental cleanup and enforcement actions under the superfund law as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct these costs could be substantial 

in accordance with the asset retirement and environmental obligations topic  in the asc the company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least quarterly giving consideration to a number of factors such as 

 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates  continued 

as of december 2011  the company had 83 million  in environmental reserves these recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted and include future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs but exclude any anticipated insurance recoveries based on the review process the company has recorded amounts to cover contingent anticipated future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are estimable and probable payments related to these liabilities are expected to be made over the next several years environmental remediation costs are included in materials supplies and other on the consolidated income statement 

currently the company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities if any on some sites until completion of future environmental studies in addition conditions that are currently unknown could at any given location result in additional exposure the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reliably estimated based upon information currently available however the company believes its environmental reserves are adequate to fund remedial actions to comply with present laws and regulations 

legal 

in accordance with the contingencies topic in the asc an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated if no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred 

the company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above the amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings newly discovered or developed evidence or changes in laws regulations and evidentiary standards

pension and postretirement medical plan accounting 

the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried management personnel the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement for employees hired in 2003 or thereafter benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age service and compensation   as of december 2011  the projected benefit obligation for the company’s pension plans was 27 billion  csx did not make contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2011  or 2010  

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates  continued 

in addition to these plans the company sponsors a selfinsured postretirement medical plan and a life insurance plan that provide benefits to fulltime salaried management employees hired prior to january 1 2003 upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met prior to 2011 the postretirement medical plan was partially funded by all participating retirees with retiree contributions adjusted annually beginning in 2011 medicareeligible retirees are covered by a health reimbursement arrangement which is an employerfunded account that can be used for reimbursement of eligible medical expenses nonmedicare eligible retirees continue to be covered by the existing selfinsured program the life insurance plan is noncontributory 

for information related to the funded status of the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans see note 8 employee benefit plans 

  

the accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the compensationretirement benefits topic  in the asc this rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following 

 

the company engages independent external actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the company selects the company reviews the discount rates longterm rate of return on plan assets salary scale inflation rates and health care cost trend rates on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends as appropriate 

discount rates 

  

discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component of pension and postretirement expense discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other postretirement benefits could be effectively settled or in other words how much it would cost the company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the companys expected future benefit payments the company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans expected benefit payments 

the discount rates used by the company to value its 2011  pension and postretirement obligations are 475  and 425  respectively for 2010  the discount rate used by the company to value its pension and postretirement obligations was 50  and 45  respectively discount rates may differ for pension and postretirement benefits due to varying duration of the liabilities for projected payments for each plan as of december 2011  the estimated duration of pensions and post retirement benefits is approximately 11  years and 7  years respectively 

each year these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates in general if interest rates decline or rise the assumed discount rates will change 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates  continued 

longterm rate of return on plan assets 

  

the expected longterm average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation in estimating that rate the company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected longterm rate of return on assets as this assumption is longterm it is adjusted less frequently than other assumptions used in pension accounting the longterm rate of return on plan assets used by the company to value its pension obligation was 8  and 825  in 2011  and 2010  respectively 

salary scale inflation rates 

  

salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the company the company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates the company used a salary scale rate of 4  to value its 2011  and 2010  pension obligations 

health care cost trend rates 

  

health care cost trend rates are based on recent plan experience and industry trends the company uses actuarial data to substantiate the inflation assumption for health care costs representing increases in total plan costs which include claims and administrative fee cost components the 2011  and 2010  assumed health care cost trend rate for benefit obligations was 85  for nonmedicareeligible participants and 8  for medicareeligible participants which is expected to decrease gradually until reaching 5  in 2018 based upon current actuarial projections however the yeartoyear comparisons may fluctuate 

other assumptions 

the calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to mortality rates turnover and retirement age these assumptions are based upon historical data and are selected by management 

2012  estimated pension and postretirement expense 

net pension and postretirement benefits expense for 2012  is expected to be approximately 85 million  and 28 million  respectively compared to 73 million  and 19 million  respectively in 2011  the increase in the pension expense is primarily related to additional amortization of the losses incurred by the pension plan assets during 2011  and the decrease in the discount rate which causes expense to increase partially offset by the return on anticipated discretionary contributions 

csx corporation

critical accounting estimates  continued 

the following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effect of changes in certain assumptions like discount rates salaries and health care costs on the 2011  estimated pension and postretirement expense 



depreciation policies for assets utilizing the grouplife method 

the company depreciates its rail assets including mainline track locomotives and freight cars using the grouplife method of accounting assets depreciated under the grouplife method comprise over 85  of total fixed assets of 34 billion  on a gross basis at december 2011  all other assets of the company are depreciated on a straightline basis the grouplife method aggregates assets with similar lives and characteristics into groups and depreciates each of these groups as a whole when using the grouplife method an underlying assumption is that each group of assets as a whole is used and depreciated to the end of its recoverable life 

the company currently utilizes more than 130  different depreciable asset categories to account for depreciation expense for the railroad assets that are depreciated under the grouplife method of accounting examples of depreciable asset categories include 18  different categories for crossties due to the different combinations of density classifications and asset types by utilizing various depreciable categories the company can more accurately account for the use of its assets 

the company believes the grouplife method of depreciation closely approximates the straightline method of depreciation additionally due to the nature of most of its assets eg track is one contiguous connected asset the company believes that this is the most effective way to properly depreciate its assets 

under the grouplife method of accounting the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic life studies and applying managements assumptions regarding the service lives of its properties a life study is the periodic review of asset lives for group assets conducted by a thirdparty specialist analyzed by the company’s management and approved by the surface transportation board “stb” the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices the stb requires life studies be performed for equipment assets every three  years and for road eg bridges and signals and track eg rail ties and ballast assets every six  years the company believes the frequency currently required by the stb provides adequate review of asset lives and that a more frequent review would not result in a material change due to the longlived nature of most of the assets 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates  continued 

changes in asset lives due to the results of the life studies are applied on a prospective basis and could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense and thus the companys results of operations 

there are several factors taken into account during the life study and they include 

 

for retirements or disposals of depreciable rail assets that occur in the ordinary course of business the asset cost net of salvage value or sales proceeds is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized as individual assets within a specific group are retired resulting gains and losses are recorded in accumulated depreciation as part of the life study an assessment of the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is made to determine if it is deficient or in excess of the appropriate amount indicated by the study any such deficiency or excess including any deferred gains or losses is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining useful life of the asset group until the next required life study since the overall assumption with grouplife is that the assets within the group on average have the same life and characteristics it is therefore concluded that the deferred gains and losses offset over time 

in the event that large groups of assets are removed from service as a result of unusual acts or sales resulting gains and losses are recognized immediately these acts are not considered to be in the normal course of business and are therefore recognized when incurred examples of such acts would be the major destruction of assets due to significant storm damage eg major hurricanes the sale of a rail line segment to another railroad or the disposal of an entire class of assets eg disposal of all refrigerated freight cars 

recent experience with life studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes which did not materially affect the company’s annual depreciation expense of 976 million  and 947 million  for 2011  and 2010  respectively a 1  change in the average life of all grouplife assets would result in an approximate 10 million  change to the company’s annual depreciation expense the company completed life studies for its equipment assets in 2009 and concluded life studies for its road track and equipment assets in 2008 resulting in a reduction in depreciation expense of 11 million  in 2010 and 18 million  in 2009

income taxes 

csx accounts for income taxes in accordance with the income taxes topic  in the asc that addresses how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under this topic the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent  likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 

csx files a consolidated federal income tax return which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries examinations of the federal income tax returns of csx have been completed through 2009  the federal income tax return for 2010  currently is under review during 2011  the company participated in a contemporaneous internal revenue service “irs” audit of tax year 2011  management believes an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed while the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty it is the opinion of csx management that none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition results of operations or liquidity of csx an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items however could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year as of december 2011  the company’s uncertain tax positions were 22 million

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

csx does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes historically the company has used derivative financial instruments to address market risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and the risk of volatility in its fuel costs 

at december 2011  csx had 44 million  of outstanding floating rate debt obligations outstanding a 1  fluctuation in interest rates on these notes would cause a 1 million  change in interest expense this amount was determined by considering the impact of an interest rate fluctuation on the balances of our floating rate debt at december 30 2011

other revenue accounted for 3 of the company’s total revenue in 2010 this revenue category includes revenue from regional subsidiary railroads demurrage revenue for customer volume commitments not met switching and other incidental charges revenue from regional railroads includes shipments by railroads that the company does not directly operate demurrage represents charges assessed when freight cars are held beyond a specified period of time switching revenue is generated when csxt switches cars between trains for a customer or another railroad 

other entities 

in addition to csxt the company’s subsidiaries include csx intermodal terminals inc “csx intermodal terminals” total distribution services inc “tdsi” transflo terminal services inc “transflo” csx technology inc “csx technology” and other subsidiaries the company’s intermodal business links customers to railroads via trucks and terminals csx intermodal terminals owns and operates a system of intermodal terminals predominantly in the eastern united states and also performs drayage services the pickup and delivery of intermodal shipments and trucking dispatch operations  tdsi serves the automotive industry with distribution centers and storage locations transflo connects nonrail served customers to the many benefits of rail by transferring products such as ethanol and minerals from rail to trucks csx technology and other subsidiaries provide support services for the company 

csx’s other holdings include csx real property inc a subsidiary responsible for the company’s real estate sales leasing acquisition and management and development activities these activities are classified in other income because they are not considered by the company to be operating activities results of these activities fluctuate with the timing of nonoperating real estate sales 

csx intermodal inc “intermodal” was a subsidiary of csx until it merged with csxt during 2010 prior to the merger intermodal was the parent company of csx intermodal terminals and conducted the sales and marketing activities associated with intermodal transportation service now provided by csxt the company no longer reflects the intermodal business as a separate segment csx’s president views intermodal similarly to merchandise and coal intermodal revenue will continue to be viewed as a separate revenue group however a separate income statement and operating ratio are no longer prepared and business segment disclosures are no longer required all prior period disclosures have been revised to reflect this change 

this change was a result of certain management realignments a strategic business review and a change in the company’s intermodal service associated with the start of the umax program the umax program which began during 2010 is a domestic interline container program jointly marketed by csx and union pacific corporation through the umax program the company provides 53 foot containers to customers for local domestic shipments or transcontinental service provided jointly by csx and union pacific corporation

see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for operating revenue operating income and total assets for each of the last three fiscal years 

 

company history 

  

  a leader in freight rail transportation for more than 180 years the company’s heritage dates back to the early nineteenth century when the baltimore and ohio railroad company “bo” – the nation’s first common carrier – was chartered in 1827 since that time the company has built on this foundation to create a railroad that could safely and reliably service the everincreasing demands of a growing nation 

  

  since its founding numerous railroads have combined with the former bo through merger and consolidation to create what has become csx each of the railroads that combined into the csx family brought unique and valuable geographical reach to new markets gateways cities ports and transportation corridors 

  

  csx was incorporated in 1978 under virginia law in 1980 the company completed the merger of the chessie system “chessie” and seaboard coast line industries “seaboard” into csx the merger allowed the company to connect northern population centers and appalachian coal fields to growing southeastern markets later the company’s acquisition of key portions of conrail inc allowed csxt to link the northeast including new england and the new york metropolitan area with chicago and midwestern markets as well as the growing areas in the southeast already served by csxt this current rail network allows the company to directly serve every major market in the eastern united states with safe dependable environmentally responsible and fuel efficient freight transportation and intermodal service 

 

competition 

  

  the business environment in which the company operates is highly competitive shippers typically select transportation providers that offer the most compelling combination of service and price service requirements both in terms of transit time and reliability vary by shipper and commodity as a result the company’s primary competition varies by commodity geographic location and mode of available transportation 

  

  csxt’s primary rail competitor is norfolk southern railway which operates throughout much of the company’s territory other railroads also operate in parts of the company’s territory depending on the specific market competing railroads and deregulated motor carriers may exert pressure on price and service levels for further discussion on the risk of competition to the company see item 1a risk factors

regulatory environment 

  

  the companys operations are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to many businesses in the united states the railroad operations conducted by the companys subsidiaries including csxt are subject in many respects to the regulatory jurisdiction of the surface transportation board “stb” the federal railroad administration “fra” and its sister agency within the us department of transportation “dot” the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration “phmsa” together fra and phmsa have broad jurisdiction over railroad operating standards and practices including track freight cars and locomotives and hazardous materials requirements additionally the transportation security administration “tsa” a component of the department of homeland security “dhs” has broad authority over railroad operating practices that may have homeland security implications 

  

  although the staggers act of 1980 significantly deregulated rail rates and much of the rail traffic of the companys subsidiaries is currently exempt from rate regulation by agency decision the stb has broad jurisdiction over railroad commercial practices including some railroad rates routes fuel surcharges conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines this includes jurisdiction over freight car charges the transfer extension or abandonment of rail lines rates charged on certain regulated rail traffic and any acquisition of control over rail common carriers 

  

  in 2008 congress enacted the rail safety improvement act the “rsia” the legislation includes a mandate that all class i freight railroads implement a positive train control system “ptc” by december 31 2015 ptc must be installed on all main lines with passenger and commuter operations as well as those over which toxicbyinhalation hazardous materials “tih” are transported implementation of a ptc system is designed to prevent traintotrain collisions overspeed derailments incursions into established workzone limits and a train from diverting offcourse onto another set of tracks through a switch left in a wrong position significant capital costs are anticipated with the implementation of ptc as well as ongoing operating expenses currently csx estimates that the total multiyear cost of ptc implementation will be at least 12 billion for the company 

  in december 2009 a proposed bill called the “surface transportation board reauthorization act of 2009” was introduced in the senate but not advanced in january 2011 the bill now referred to as the surface transportation board reauthorization act of 2011 “stb reauthorization bill” was reintroduced the stb reauthorization bill if adopted could increase government involvement in railroad pricing service and operations the proposed legislation also includes provisions that would reduce the ability to price at market levels and open a carrier’s privatelyowned and maintained rail network to competitors where certain conditions are met 

    

  if adopted as proposed this bill could have a material adverse effect on the company’s revenue and operations as well as the ability to invest in enhancing and maintaining vital infrastructure prior to the reintroduction of the stb reauthorization bill the stb had already announced two new hearings  one on february 24 2011 to review the utility of boxcar intermodal automotive and other exemptions and the other on june 22 2011 to explore the current state of competition in the railroad industry

  the company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies including the stb the fra and other state and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic health safety labor environmental tax legal and other matters new rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the company’s operating costs or reduce operating efficiencies for example the rsia mandated the installation by december 31 2015 of positive train control ptc on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that have commuter or passenger operations the fra issued its final rule in january 2010 on the design operational requirements and implementation of the new technology the final rule is expected to impose significant new costs on the company and the rail industry noncompliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the company and can subject the company to fines penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions 

climate change legislation and regulation could adversely affect the company’s operations and financial results 

  

  climate change legislation or regulation has been proposed and in some cases adopted on the federal state provincial canada and local levels these final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions caps taxes or other controls on greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions in particular the us environmental protection agency “epa” has issued various regulations targeting ghg emissions including rules and standards governing ghg emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles 

  

  any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations could adversely affect csx and its customers’ business operations and financial results by among other things 1 increasing energy costs generally making it difficult for the company’s customers in the us and canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner particularly in the absence of similar regulations in countries like india and china 2 increasing the company’s fuel and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies and 3 reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the united states any of these factors could reduce the amount of traffic the company handles and have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

capacity constraints could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency 

  

  csxt may experience rail network difficulties related to i increased passenger activities including highspeed rail in capacityconstrained areas or ii regulatory changes impacting when   csxt can transport freight or service routes that could have a negative effect on csxt’s operational fluidity leading to deterioration of service asset utilization and overall efficiency

general economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight 

  

  the economic recession adversely affected demand for rail and intermodal services although traffic improved in 2010 a decline in general domestic and global   economic conditions that affect demand for the commodities the company carries could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects 

 

csxt as a common carrier by rail is required by law to transport hazardous materials which could expose the company to significant costs and claims 

  

  under federal regulations csxt is required to transport hazardous materials under its common carrier obligation a train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury property or natural resource damage and environmental penalties and remediation obligations such claims if insured could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates csxt is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials 

  

  in november 2008 the tsa issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail noncompliance with these rules can subject the company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident finally legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances which could result in increased operating costs reduced operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials 

the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs 

  

  the company is subject to wideranging federal state provincial canada and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions into the air ground and water the handling storage use generation transportation and disposal of waste and other materials the cleanup of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees if we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which we are responsible in certain circumstances environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties leased properties adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or company predecessors as well as to properties currently owned leased or used by the company 

  

csx corporation 

part i 

  

  the company has been and may in the future be subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated or is strictly liable under environmental laws or regulations and such violations can result in the company’s incurring fines penalties or costs relating to the cleanup of environmental contamination although the company believes it has appropriately recorded current and longterm liabilities for known and estimable future environmental costs it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing the company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination 

the company relies on the stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business 

  

  the company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business a significant disruption or failure of the company’s information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment could result in a service interruption process failure security breach or other operational difficulties the performance and reliability of the company’s technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively 

disruption of the supply chain could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs 

  

  the capital intensive nature and sophistication of core rail equipment including rolling stock equipment locomotives rail and ties limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers if any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage csxt could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage in addition a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and as such adverse developments in international relations new trade regulations disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase csxt’s operating costs 

  

  additionally if a fuel supply shortage were to arise whether due to the organization of the petroleum exporting countries or other production restrictions lower refinery outputs a disruption of oil imports or otherwise the company would be negatively impacted 

 

failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes andor work stoppages 

  

  most of csxts employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements generally speaking these agreements are bargained nationally by the national carriers conference committee in the rail industry negotiations have generally taken place over a number of years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages if csxt is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements however it could result in strikes by the affected workers loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members under the railway labor act’s procedures which include mediation coolingoff periods and the possibility of presidential intervention neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted

the company faces competition from other transportation providers 

  

  the company experiences competition in the form of pricing service reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and to a less significant extent barges ships and pipelines transportation providers such as motor carriers and barges utilize public rightsofway that are built and maintained by governmental entities while csxt and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks using largely internal resources any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks could negatively impact the company’s competitive position 

future acts of terrorism war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the company’s operations 

  

  terrorist attacks along with any government response to those attacks may adversely affect the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity csxt’s rail lines or other key infrastructure may be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war this risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues in addition premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the company could increase dramatically or the coverage may no longer be available 

  

  furthermore in response to the heightened risk of terrorism federal state and local governmental bodies are proposing and in some cases have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry for example the department of homeland security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials complying with these regulations could continue to increase the company’s operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies 

 

severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage 

  

  the company’s operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences including floods fires hurricanes and earthquakes as a result the company’s rail network may be damaged its workforce may be unavailable fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur in addition the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions insurance maintained by the company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations depending on the nature of the risk insured this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the company’s damages or damages to others and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates even with insurance if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service the company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations

the company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures 

  

  the company is subject to various claims and lawsuits including putative class action litigation alleging violations of antitrust laws the company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits additionally existing litigation may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in the company’s reserve estimates as the ultimate outcome of existing litigation is subject to numerous factors outside of the company’s control final judgments or settlement amounts may differ materially from the recorded reserves 

 

increases in the number and magnitude of property damage and personal injury claims could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

 

  the company faces inherent business risk from exposure to occupational and personal injury claims property damage including storm damage and claims related to train accidents the company may incur significant costs to defend such claims 

 

  existing claims may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in reserve estimates as the ultimate outcome of existing claims is subject to numerous factors outside of the company’s control although the company establishes reserves and maintains insurance to cover these types of claims final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may differ materially from the recorded reserves and exceed the company’s insurance coverage

 item 2 properties 

  

  the company’s properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure locomotives and freight cars and equipment these categories and the geography of the network are described below 

track and infrastructure 

  

  serving 23 states the district of columbia and the canadian provinces of ontario and quebec the csxt rail network serves among other markets new york philadelphia and boston in the northeast and midatlantic the southeast markets of atlanta miami and new orleans and the midwestern cities of st louis memphis and chicago 

csx corporation 

part i 

csxt’s track structure includes main thoroughfares connecting terminals and yards known as mainline track track within terminals and switching yards track adjacent to the mainlines used for passing trains track connecting the mainline track to customer locations and track that diverts trains from one track to another known as turnouts total track miles are greater than csxt’s approximately 21000 route miles which reflect the size of csxt’s network that connects markets customers and western railroads at december 2010 the breakdown of track miles was as follows 

 

 

in addition to its physical track structure csxt operates numerous yards and terminals these serve as the hubs between csxt and its local customers and as sorting facilities where rail cars often are received resorted and placed onto new outbound trains 

the company’s ten largest yards and terminals based on annual volume number of rail cars or intermodal containers processed are listed below

network geography 

  

csxt’s operations are primarily focused on four major transportation networks and corridors which are defined geographically and by commodity flows below 

coal network   – the csxt coal network connects the coal mining operations in the appalachian mountain region with industrial areas in the northeast and midatlantic as well as many river lake and deep water port facilities csxt’s coal network is well positioned to supply utility markets in both the northeast and southeast and to transport coal shipments for exports outside of the us roughly three of every four tons of domestic coal and almost half of the export coal that the company transports is used for generating electricity 

interstate 90 i90 corridor – this csxt corridor links chicago and the midwest to metropolitan areas in new york and new england this route also known as the “waterlevel route” has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks referred to as double track these superior engineering attributes permit the corridor to support consistent highspeed intermodal automotive and merchandise service this corridor is a primary route for import traffic coming from the far east through western ports moving eastward across the country through chicago and into the population centers in the northeast the i90 corridor is also a critical link between ports in new york new jersey and pennsylvania and consumption markets in the midwest this route carries consumer goods from all three of the company’s major markets – merchandise coal and intermodal 

interstate 95 i95 corridor – the csxt i95 corridor connects charleston jacksonville miami and many other cities throughout the southeast with the heavily populated northeastern cities of baltimore philadelphia and new york csxt primarily transports food and consumer products as well as metals and chemicals along this line it is the only rail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of washington dc and provides access to major eastern ports 

southeastern corridor – this critical part of the network runs between csxt’s western gateways of chicago st louis and memphis through the cities of nashville birmingham and atlanta and markets in the southeast the southeastern corridor is the premier rail route connecting these key cities gateways and markets and positions csxt to efficiently handle projected traffic volumes of intermodal automotive and general merchandise traffic the corridor also provides direct rail service between the coal reserves of the southern illinois basin and the increasing demand for coal in the southeast

locomotives 

  

  csxt operates more than 4000 locomotives of which over 95 are owned by csxt freight locomotives are the power source used primarily to pull trains switching locomotives are used in yards to sort railcars so that the right railcar is attached to the right train in order to deliver it to its final destination auxiliary units are typically used to provide extra traction for heavy trains in hilly terrain at december 2010 csxt’s fleet of owned and longterm leased locomotives consisted of the following types of locomotives 

 

  

  as of december 2010 approximately 500 locomotives or 12 were held in temporary storage as volume continues to return these locomotives will be placed back into service after restorative maintenance procedures are performed of these over 200 locomotives can be brought back immediately 

equipment 

  

  in 2010 the average daily fleet of cars on line consisted of approximately 211000 at any time over half of the railcars on the csxt system are not owned or leased by the company examples of these are railcars owned by other railroads which are utilized by csxt shipperfurnished or private cars which are generally used only in that shipper’s service and multilevel railcars used to transport automobiles which are shared between railroads   

 

 

  

 

 

  the company’s equipment consists of freight cars containers and chassis

 

gondolas – support csxt’s metals markets and provide transport for woodchips and other bulk commodities some gondolas are equipped with special hoods for protecting products like coil and sheet steel 

opentop hoppers – transport heavy dry bulk commodities such as coal coke stone sand ores and gravel that are resistant to weather conditions 

box cars – include a variety of tonnages sizes door configurations and heights to accommodate a wide range of finished products including paper auto parts appliances and building materials insulated box cars deliver food products canned goods beer and wine 

 

covered hoppers – have a permanent roof and are segregated based upon commodity density lighter bulk commodities such as grain fertilizer flour salt sugar clay and lime are shipped in large cars called jumbo covered hoppers heavier commodities like cement ground limestone and glass sand are shipped in small cube covered hoppers 

multilevel flat cars – transport finished automobiles and are differentiated by the number of levels bilevels for large vehicles such as pickup trucks and suvs and trilevels for sedans and smaller automobiles 

flat cars – used for shipping intermodal containers and trailers or bulk and finished goods such as lumber pipe plywood drywall and pulpwood 

containers  weatherproof boxes used for bulk shipment of freight 

chassis  wheeled support framework for a container that allows it to be attached to a tractor all of the company’s chassis are leased 

  

  other cars owned or leased on the network include but are not limited to center beam cars for transporting lumber and building products the company also has other types of equipment such as lift equipment and doublestack railcars which allow for two containers to be mounted one above the other

 item 3  legal proceedings 

fuel surcharge antitrust litigation 

since 2007 31 putative class action suits have been filed in various federal district courts against csxt and three other usbased class i railroads the class action suits have been consolidated in federal court in the district of columbia the court has not yet ruled on whether it is appropriate to certify the case as a class action 

the lawsuits contain substantially similar allegations to the effect that the defendants’ fuel surcharge practices relating to contract and unregulated traffic resulted from an illegal conspiracy in violation of antitrust laws the suits seek unquantified treble damages three times the amount of actual damages allegedly sustained by purported class members attorneys’ fees and other relief 

all but three of the lawsuits purport to be filed on behalf of a class of shippers that allegedly purchased rail freight transportation services from the defendants through the use of contracts or through other means exempt from rate regulation during defined periods commencing as early as june 2003 and that were assessed fuel surcharges three of the lawsuits purport to be on behalf of indirect purchasers of rail services the court denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss the direct purchasers’ claims the court dismissed all of the indirect purchasers’ causes of action seeking money damages but did not dismiss their request for injunctive relief the dismissal was upheld on appeal plaintiffs then petitioned the united states supreme court to hear the case the supreme court denied the petition in december 2010 

  

csx corporation 

part i 

  

one additional lawsuit was filed but not served by an individual shipper csxt entered into a tolling agreement with this shipper whereby the shipper agreed to dismiss the lawsuit against csxt without prejudice and csxt agreed to extend the statute of limitations for the claims asserted until the end of 2010 that agreement has been extended to the end of 2011 

csxt believes that its fuel surcharge practices are lawful accordingly csxt intends to vigorously defend itself against the purported class actions which it believes are without merit while csxt cannot predict the outcome of the private lawsuits or of any government investigations charges or additional litigation that may be filed in the future we currently believe that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on any of our results of operations financial condition and liquidity penalties for violating antitrust laws can be severe involving both potential criminal and civil liability if a material adverse outcome were to occur and be sustained it could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

other legal proceedings  

in addition to the matters described above the company is involved in litigation incidental to its business and is a party to a number of legal actions and claims various governmental proceedings and private civil lawsuits including but not limited to those related to environmental and hazardous material exposure matters fela claims by employees other personal injury claims and disputes and complaints involving certain transportation rates and charges some of the legal proceedings include claims for compensatory as well as punitive damages and others are or are purported to be class actions while the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty considering among other things the legal defenses available and liabilities that have been recorded along with applicable insurance it is currently the opinion of csx management that none of these pending items will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items however could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity in that particular period

 item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

st rategic overview 

  

the company and the rail industry provide customers with access to an expansive and interconnected transportation network that plays a key role in north american commerce the company’s network is positioned to reach more than twothirds of americans who account for about threequarters of the nation’s consumption of goods through this network the company transports a broad portfolio of products ranging from coal and new energy sources like biodiesel and ethanol to automobiles chemicals and consumer products 

csx remains highly committed to delivering value to shareholders through a balanced approach to deploying capital that includes investments in infrastructure dividend improvements and share repurchases in 2011 the company plans to invest 20 billion to sustain core infrastructure and rolling stock support various strategic investments and fund positive train control “ptc” implementation costs key terminal expansions and infrastructure projects are important components of csx’s investment strategy strategic investments through publicprivate partnerships including the national gateway initiative and the massachusetts and florida projects will provide enhanced transit times and improved service for customers 

the national gateway is a multiyear infrastructure initiative which will increase intermodal capacity on key corridors between midatlantic ports and the midwest total project costs are approximately 850 million of which the company expects to contribute approximately 400 million a key component of this initiative is the company’s new northwest ohio intermodal terminal that is scheduled to become operational in the first half of 2011 this highcapacity terminal will expand service offerings to customers as well as improve market access to east coast ports once complete the new terminal will be the most environmentally friendly technologically advanced intermodal terminal in existence 

these longterm investments provide a foundation for volume growth productivity as well as safe and reliable operations to continue these types of investments the company must be able to operate in an environment in which it can generate adequate returns and drive shareholder value csx will continue to advocate for a fair and balanced regulatory environment to ensure that the value of the company’s rail service will be reflected in any potential new legislation and policy 

in addition to investing in its network csx increased its quarterly cash dividend twice from 22 cents to 26 cents per share during 2010 these were the seventh and eighth dividend increases over a fiveyear period and represents a 35 percent compounded annual growth rate csx also expects to repurchase approximately 300 million in shares by the end of the first quarter representing the remainder of its existing 3 billion share repurchase program

2010 highlights 

 

 

 

 

2010 results reflect strong yearoveryear volume and revenue growth   as a result of the improving economy revenue increased 18 from the prior year to nearly 106 billion with gains across all of the company’s markets with particular growth in automotive and metals overall gains were driven by a 10 increase in volume continued pricing above rail inflation and higher fuel recovery associated with the increase in fuel prices the company achieved pricing gains primarily due to improved service and the overall cost advantages that railbased solutions provide to customers versus other modes of transportation 

 

as volume increased expenses increased by 794 million or only 12 from the prior year this increase was driven primarily by higher laborrelated costs including inflation and incentive compensation an increase in volumerelated costs and higher fuel expense due to a rise in fuel prices although expenses increased yearoveryear csx was able to achieve a record operating ratio of 711 due to the company’s continued focus on cost control and productivity initiatives fiscal year 2010 results include an extra week of activity as compared to fiscal year 2009 this activity did not have a material impact on the company’s full year results of operations

in addition to the financial highlights described above the company measures and reports safety and service performance over the last five years csx has improved its safety and service measures by more than 50 and generated nearly 1 billion in total productivity gains in effect csx has worked to create a culture of accountability which focuses on delivering enhanced performance by communicating a focus on leadership discipline and execution 

during 2010 the company again demonstrated great improvements related to safety and operating performance for 2010 the federal railroad administration “fra” personal injury rate improved 17 to 101 compared to 120 in 2009 this is a record fullyear personal injury performance for the full year at csx the 2010 reported fra train accident frequency rate improved 9 to 268 compared to 294 in 2009 these excellent results were achieved through a sustained commitment to safety 

key service metrics in 2010 declined slightly as volume increased 10 from last year ontime train originations and arrivals declined to 75 and 69 respectively dwell time increased to 250 hours from 241 hours in 2009 average train velocity declined 4 to 210 miles per hour while these key measures declined they remain within the ranges experienced over the last several years and continue to support efficient and reliable train operations for csx’s customers

volume and revenue 

  

merchandise 

 

agricultural 

agricultural products – volume grew with increased shipments of feed grains and ethanol shipments of feed grains improved with expanded meat production and lower wheat imports ethanol shipments grew as the amount of ethanol in fuel continued to increase 

phosphates and fertilizers – volume increased as a result of strength in demand for domestic fertilizers due to a strong planting season and due to replenishment of low inventories 

food and consumer – volume increased slightly as strength in refrigerated products primarily fruits and vegetables and alcoholic beverages were partially offset by weakness in demand for appliances 

industrial 

chemicals – growth occurred across most markets reflecting improvement in demand for intermediate products used in manufacturing automobiles and consumer goods many plastics and chemicals are key inputs in the production of both durable and nondurable goods as well as packaging 

automotive – strong growth was driven by an increase in north american lightvehicle production in response to increased demand in the improving economy 

 

metals – volume growth was driven by increased shipments of sheet steel for auto production increases in scrap steel resulting from higher steel production and increases in energyrelated products 

housing and construction 

emerging markets – shipments increased in limestone transportation equipment and aggregates which include crushed stone sand and gravel as a result of overall market growth due to the improving economy 

forest products – volume increased with strength in shipments of pulp board and paper used in packaging for consumer products volume also increased slightly in constructionrelated markets

coal 

volume was basically flat as increased export shipments were offset by weakness in utility shipments higher export shipments were due to greater demand for us metallurgical coal in asia and steam coal in europe shipments to utility customers were down as high utility stockpiles were reduced throughout the year and are approaching targeted levels the increase in revenue per unit was driven by improved yield higher fuel recovery and longer length of haul total coal volume is expected to increase as the company expects to ship approximately 35 – 40 million tons of export coal and projects increases in utility coal volume in 2011 

intermodal 

  

  international and domestic shipment growth resulted from us inventory replenishment improved us exports new business truckload conversions and new umax and doortodoor service offerings 

the revenueperunit decline was driven by the impact of switching from a purchased transportation arrangement to a domestic interline program at the start of second quarter this program known as umax provides customers with containers for local shipments or transcontinental service provided jointly by csx and union pacific corporation this revenueperunit decline was partly offset by increased fuel recovery and an improved pricing environment

  revenue gains were primarily driven by benefits for contract volume commitments not met 

expense 

total expenses for 2010 increased 12 or 794 million to 76 billion compared to the prior year descriptions of each expense category as well as significant yearoveryear changes are described below 

   

labor and fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes health and welfare costs pension other postretirement benefits and incentive compensation these expenses increased 328 million primarily driven by inflation and higher incentive compensation 

  

materials supplies and other   expenses consist primarily of materials and contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment and for terminal services at automotive facilities this category also includes costs related to casualty claims environmental remediation train accidents utilities property and sales taxes and professional services in addition this category includes amounts paid to other transportation companies total materials supplies and other expense increased by 76 million in 2010 this increase was primarily driven by the following

fuel expense   includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as nonlocomotive fuel this expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel fuel expense increased 363 million primarily due to higher fuel prices and higher volume average fuel price per gallon increased 055 or 32 from 171 in 2009 to 226 in 2010 

depreciation   expense primarily relates to recognizing the cost of a capital asset such as locomotives railcars and track structure over its useful life this expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year depreciation expense increased 44 million in 2010 primarily due to a larger asset base 

equipment and other includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies net of rents received by csxt for use of its equipment this category of expenses also includes lease expenses for locomotives railcars containers and trailers office and other rentals these expenses decreased 17 million primarily due to cost savings associated with improved asset utilization and lower lease expense partially offset by volumerelated increases

interest expense 

interest expense decreased 1 million to 557 million primarily due to lower average debt balances during 2010

other income – net 

other income decreased 2 million to 32 million primarily related to lower interest income caused by lower cash and investment balances and lower interest rates in 2010 

income tax expense 

income tax expense increased 365 million to 983 million primarily due to higher earnings during 2010 

net earnings 

net earnings increased 420 million to 16 billion and earnings per diluted share increased 117 to 406 in 2010 this increase was primarily due to higher operating income net of income taxes in 2010

2009 vs 2008 results of operations 

volume and revenue 

revenue decreased 22 billion or 20 to 90 billion from the prior year driven by a 15 decline in volume and lower fuel cost recovery associated with the sharp decline in fuel prices the broadbased economic recession drove yearoveryear volume declines across all major markets in the 2009 challenging environment the company continued to achieve pricing gains primarily due to improved service and the overall cost advantages that railbased solutions provide to customers versus other modes of transportation 

merchandise 

agricultural 

agricultural products   – volume was down slightly as the growth in ethanol and export grain was more than offset by lower poultry production which negatively impacted the feed grain and ingredient markets 

phosphates and fertilizers – international and domestic shipments declined due to lower phosphate and potash soil application by farmers in reaction to lower prices for grain and the tight credit environment 

food and consumer –weakness in residential construction caused reduced shipments of appliances and other consumer goods yet basic needs markets such as food products were less severely impacted by the economic conditions 

industrial 

chemicals – volume declined as weakness in the housing automotive and consumer goods markets significantly reduced demand for chemical products related to those markets revenue per unit was flat as yield management efforts were offset by lower fuel recovery 

automotive   – volume declined due to a reduction in light vehicle production several plant closures and lower vehicle sales driven by the weak economy and a tight credit environment however volume improved in the second half of the year as inventories stabilized and the cash for clunkers program helped spur sales revenue per unit was negatively impacted by lower fuel recovery associated with the sharp decline in fuel prices 

metals – the largest decline in volume was experienced in metals driven by weak global and domestic steel demand in the automotive and construction industries the decline in demand moderated during the year due to replenishment of low inventories and an improvement in automotive production 

housing and construction 

emerging markets – volume was down as a result of declines in aggregate shipments such as crushed stone sand and gravel caused by a continued weakness in both residential and nonresidential construction 

 

csx corporation 

part ii 

  

forest products – a weak housing market drove the decline in lumber and building products paper volume continued to be soft due to electronic media substitution and less packaging being used as a result of lower consumer spending 

coal 

volume declines were driven by lower demand from electric utilities and a decrease in exports compared to 2008 domestic coal demand for generating electricity was down due to natural gas substitution and lower industrial production resulting in continued high stock pile levels     the 2009 export market decline was a result of both lower steel production in europe reducing the need for metallurgical coal used to produce steel and less expensive alternative global sources for european utilities overall revenue per unit for the coal market improved as yield management efforts more than offset lower fuel recovery 

intermodal 

volume decline was driven by a decrease in international traffic due to the economy which was partially offset by domestic growth in railroad provided container shipments overtheroad truckload conversions and expanded service offerings revenue per unit was lower primarily due to decreased fuel recovery and competitive truck pricing 

expense 

total expenses for 2009 decreased 20 or 17 billion to 68 billion compared to the prior year significant yearoveryear changes are described below 

   

labor and fringe   expenses decreased 326 million primarily driven by labor productivity initiatives such as employee furloughs and reduced crew overtime lower incentive compensation was partially offset by inflation and other items 

materials supplies and other   expenses decreased by 408 million in 2009 this decrease is driven by several items

fuel expense decreased 968 million primarily due to sharply lower fuel prices and lower volume average fuel prices per gallon decreased 137 or 44 from 308 in 2008 to 171 in 2009 

depreciation expense increased 3 million primarily due to a slightly larger asset base this increase was largely offset by lower depreciation rates resulting from periodic asset life studies 

equipment and other rents   expense decreased 34 million mainly due to lower volume and fewer locomotive leases 

other 

interest expense 

interest expense increased 39 million to 558 million due to higher average debt balances in 2009 

other income – net 

other income decreased 66 million to 34 million in 2009 2008 results included a 30 million noncash adjustment to correct equity earnings from a nonconsolidated subsidiary that was not repeated in 2009 reduced interest income as a result of lower average cash and investment balances also contributed to this decrease in addition real estate sales declined during 2009 

income tax expense 

income tax expense decreased 229 million to 618 million primarily due to lower earnings in 2009 

net earnings 

net earnings decreased 212 million to 11 billion and earnings per diluted share decreased 043 to 289 in 2009 this decrease was primarily due to the following factors

liqui dity and capital resources 

liquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures including those to implement regulatory and legislative initiatives in order to have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity its balance sheet sources and uses of cash flow and external factors should be reviewed 

material changes in the consolidated balance sheets and significant cash flows 

consolidated balance sheets 

csx’s balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of csx’s balanced approach in deploying its capital for the benefit of its shareholders which includes investments in infrastructure dividend improvement and share repurchases 

total assets increased 13 billion from the previous year this was driven by net properties which increased 735 million since december 2009 due to planned capital expenditures other longterm assets increased 188 million as a result of cash consideration paid in the exchange of debt securities see note 9 debt and credit agreements on the liability side the company increased net debt by 656 million due to additional borrowings deferred income tax liability also increased by 525 million due to the impact of accelerated depreciation and bonus depreciation bonus depreciation increased from 50 to 100 due to legislative changes that became effective in september 2010 and will continue in 2011 finally shareholders’ equity decreased 68 million as a result of 15 billion of share repurchases since december 2009 which was offset by increased earnings during 2010 

sources of cash 

the company has multiple sources of cash first the company generates cash from operations in 2010 the company generated 32 billion of cash from operating activities which represented a 12 billion increase from the prior year this increase was primarily driven by higher earnings in 2010 second csx has access to numerous financing sources including a 125 billion fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in may 2012 this facility can be increased by an additional 500 million to 175 billion with the approval of the lending banks as of the date of this filing the company has not drawn on this facility see note 9 debt and credit agreements for more information 

csx filed its shelf registration statement with the sec in february 2010 this shelf registration statement is unlimited as to amount and may be used subject to market conditions and csx board authorization to issue debt or equity securities at csx’s discretion while csx seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit csx to sell such debt securities on acceptable terms at any given time or at all 

 

csx corporation 

part ii 

uses of cash 

net cash used in investing activities during 2010 was driven by 18   billion of property additions funds used for property additions are further described below 

 

 

 

among other things the company uses cash for scheduled payments of debt and leases and to pay dividends to shareholders csx paid dividends of 372 million in 2010 which was 27 million more than prior year this increase was primarily due to an increase in the quarterly dividend to 024 per share at the beginning of 2010 and then to 026 in fourth quarter 2010 net cash used in financing activities was 13 billion which increased 920 million primarily as a result of 15 billion of share repurchases offset by net debt in 2010 

capital spending programs are and have been designed to assure the ability to provide safe efficient and reliable transportation services for 2011 csx plans to spend 20 billion of capital of which over half will be used to sustain the core infrastructure approximately 260 million including ptc or 13 of 2011 total capital spending will be applied toward the implementation of unfunded required regulatory projects csx intends to fund these capital investments through cash generated from operations the remaining amounts will be allocated to locomotives freight cars and high return and growth or productivity investments such as the new intermodal terminal located in northwest ohio 

 

csx corporation 

part ii 

csx is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments csx may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations although new legislation or regulations such as the stb reauthorization bill or climate change legislation could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors under item 1a of this form 10k it is too early to predict the manner or severity of such impact however the company continues to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce the impact of its operations on the environment including investments in new technologies reducing fuel consumption and increasing fuel efficiency and lowering emissions 

liquidity and working capital 

currently csx is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint the company ended the year with over 13 billion of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments csx also has a 125   billion credit facility with a diverse syndicate of banks that was not drawn on additionally in 2010 the company issued 800 million of new longterm debt 

the company also has a 250 million receivables securitization facility with a 364day term and expires in december 2011 the purpose of this facility is to provide an alternative to commercial paper and a low cost source of shortterm liquidity as of the date of this filing the company has no outstanding balances drawn on this facility under the terms of this facility csxt transfers eligible thirdparty receivables to csx trade receivables a bankruptcyremote special purpose subsidiary a separate subsidiary of csx will service the receivables upon transfer the receivables become assets of csx trade receivables and are not available to the creditors of csx or any of its other subsidiaries in the event csx trade receivables draws under this facility the company will record an equivalent amount of debt on its consolidated financial statements 

working capital can also be considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its shortterm needs csx had a working capital surplus of 318 million and 705 million at december 2010 and 2009 respectively the decline since december 2009 is primarily due to a 500 million reclassification from longterm debt to current maturities of longterm debt for amounts due within the next twelve months 

the company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above although the company currently has a surplus a working capital deficit is not unusual for csx or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity the company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due furthermore the company has sufficient financial capacity including its revolving credit facility and shelf registration statement to manage its daytoday cash requirements and any anticipated obligations the company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity

credit ratings 

 

credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies standard  poor’s “sp” and moody’s investors service “moody’s” use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa1 for sp and moody’s respectively a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 

ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sp and moody’s respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade currently csx’s longterm ratings fall at the lower end of this category if csxs credit ratings were to decline to lower levels the company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt in addition a decline in csx’s credit ratings could adversely affect the market’s demand and thus the company’s ability to readily issue new debt

critic al accounting estimates 

   

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results may differ from those estimates these estimates and assumptions are discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors on a regular basis consistent with the prior year significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas 

   

 

 

 

 

 

  

casualty environmental and legal reserves 

 

casualty 

casualty reserves represent accruals for personal injury occupational injury claims and asbestos during 2010 the company increased its selfinsured retention amount for these claims from 25 million to 50 million per injury for claims occurring on or after june 1 2010 currently no individual claim is expected to exceed the company’s selfinsured retention amount in accordance with the contingencies topic in the asc to the extent the value of an individual claim exceeds the selfinsured retention amount the company would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries these reserves fluctuate based upon the timing of payments as well as changes in independent thirdparty estimates which are reviewed by management most of the claims relate to csxt unless otherwise noted below defense and processing costs which historically have been insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future are not included in the recorded liabilities 

as of december 2010 the company had 375 million in casualty reserves see below for details regarding changes in estimate for casualty reserves

personal injury 

 

personal injury reserves represent liabilities for employee workrelated and thirdparty injuries workrelated injuries for csxt employees are primarily subject to the federal employers’ liability act “fela” in addition to fela liabilities employees of other csx subsidiaries are covered by various state workers’ compensation laws the federal longshore and harbor workers’ compensation program or the maritime jones act 

csxt retains an independent actuarial firm to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims and cases an analysis is performed by the independent actuarial firm semiannually and is reviewed by management the methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims it is based largely on csxt’s historical claims and settlement experience actual results may vary from estimates due to the number type and severity of the injury costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation 

during 2010 and 2009 the company reduced personal injury reserves by 24 million and 84 million respectively these reductions were based on management’s review of the actuarial analysis performed by an independent actuarial firm in recent years the company has experienced a continued downward trend in the number of injuries which has resulted in a continued reduction of the csxt’s federal railroad administration “fra” personal injury rate these reductions in reserves are a direct result of the company’s improvement in safety and were included in materials supplies and other in the consolidated income statements 

occupational  asbestos 

occupational claims arise from allegations of exposures to certain materials in the workplace such as solvents soaps chemicals collectively referred to as “irritants” and diesel fuels or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions such as repetitive stress injuries carpal tunnel syndrome and hearing loss 

the company is also party to a number of asbestos claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the workplace the heaviest possible exposure for employees resulted from work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines that were largely phased out beginning around the 1950s other types of exposures however including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials continued until these exposures were substantially eliminated by 1985 additionally the company has retained liability for asbestos claims filed against its previously owned international container shipping business diseases associated with asbestos typically have long latency periods amount of time between exposure to a disease and the onset of the disease which can range from 10 to 40 years after exposure 

   

csx corporation

critical accounting estimates continued 

csxt retains a thirdparty specialist to assist management in assessing the value of the company’s occupational and asbestos reserves the analysis is performed by the specialist semiannually and is reviewed by management the objective of the analysis is to determine the number of incurred but not reported “ibnr” claims with the exception of carpal tunnel management and thirdparty specialists have determined that seven years is the most probable time period in which unasserted claim filings and claim values can be estimated carpal tunnel claims use a threeyear period to estimate the reserve due to the shorter latency period for these types of injuries 

the third party specialist analyzes csxt’s historical claim filings settlement amounts and dismissal rates to determine future anticipated claim filing rates and average settlement values the potentially exposed population is estimated by using csx employment records and industry data from the railroad retirement 2009 report from this analysis the specialist provides an estimate of the ibnr claims liability 

the estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for this reserve a 1 increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of occupational and asbestos ibnr claims or the average claim values would result in approximately a 1 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted occupational and asbestos claims 

during 2010 and 2009 the company reduced occupational reserves by 12 million and 19 million respectively the 2010 reduction is primarily attributable to a decrease in the number of repetitive stress injury claims and lower settlement values for irritant claims the 2009 reduction is attributable to a decrease in the number of carpal tunnel and repetitive stress injury claims this reduction was included in materials supplies and other in the consolidated income statements 

during 2010 and 2009 the company reduced its reserves for asbestos claims by 13 million and 24 million respectively the 2010 reduction was primarily related to some claims that were determined to have no value due to lack of sufficient medical evidence as well as a decrease in the estimate of future claim filings the 2009 reduction was also primarily related to a significant number of claims that were determined to have no value due to lack of sufficient medical evidence these reductions in reserves were included in materials supplies and other in the consolidated income statements

environmental 

   

the company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 247 environmentally impaired sites many of these are or may be subject to remedial action under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 or cercla also known as the superfund law or similar state statutes most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations a number of these proceedings however are based on allegations that the company or its predecessors sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment recycling or disposal in addition some of the company’s land holdings were leased to others for commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the company 

in any such proceedings the company is subject to environmental cleanup and enforcement actions under the superfund law as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct these costs could be substantial 

in accordance with the asset retirement and environmental obligations topic in the asc the company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least quarterly giving consideration to a number of factors such as 

 

 

 

 

 

as of december 2010 the company had 107 million in environmental reserves these recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted and include future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs but exclude any anticipated insurance recoveries based on the review process the company has recorded amounts to cover contingent anticipated future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are estimable and probable payments related to these liabilities are expected to be made over the next several years environmental remediation costs are included in materials supplies and other on the consolidated income statement

critical accounting estimates continued 

currently the company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities if any on some sites until completion of future environmental studies in addition conditions that are currently unknown could at any given location result in additional exposure the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reliably estimated based upon information currently available however the company believes its environmental reserves are adequate to fund remedial actions to comply with present laws and regulations and that the ultimate liability for these matters if any will not materially affect its overall financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

legal 

in accordance with the contingencies topic in the asc an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated if no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred 

the company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above the amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings newly discovered or developed evidence or changes in laws regulations and evidentiary standards 

 

pension and postretirement medical plan accounting 

the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried management personnel the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement for employees hired in 2003 or thereafter benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age service and compensation as of december 2010 the projected benefit obligation for the company’s pension plans was 25 billion csx made pension plan contributions of 250 million to its qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2009 and none in 2010 

in addition to these plans the company sponsors a selfinsured postretirement medical plan and a life insurance plan that provide benefits to fulltime salaried management employees hired prior to january 1 2003 upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met prior to 2011 the postretirement medical plan was partially funded by all participating retirees with retiree contributions adjusted annually beginning in 2011 medicareeligible retirees will be covered by a health reimbursement arrangement which is an employerfunded account that can be used for reimbursement of eligible medical expenses nonmedicare eligible retirees will continue to be covered by the existing selfinsured program the life insurance plan is noncontributory 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates continued 

for information related to the funded status of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans see note 8 employee benefit plans 

the accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the compensation—retirement benefits topic in the asc this rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

the company engages independent external actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the company selects the company reviews the discount longterm rate of return salary scale inflation and health care cost trend rates on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends as appropriate 

discount rates 

 

discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component of pension and postretirement expense discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other postretirement benefits could be effectively settled or in other words how much it would cost the company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the company’s expected future benefit payments the company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans’ expected benefit payments 

the discount rates used by the company to value its 2010 pension and postretirement obligations are 50 and 45 respectively for 2009 the discount rate used by the company to value its pension and postretirement obligations was 525 and 475 respectively discount rates may differ for pension and postretirement benefits due to the different time horizons of future payments for each of the plans as of december 2010 the time horizon for pensions is approximately 11 years while for postretirement the time horizon is approximately 7 years 

each year these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates if interest rates generally decline or rise the assumed discount rates will change 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates continued 

longterm rate of return on plan assets 

 

the expected longterm average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation in estimating that rate the company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected longterm rate of return on assets as this assumption is longterm it is adjusted less frequently than other assumptions used in pension accounting the longterm rate of return on plan assets used by the company to value its pension obligation was 825 and 85 in 2010 and 2009 respectively 

salary scale inflation rates 

 

salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the company the company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates the company used a salary scale rate of 40 to value its 2010 and 2009 pension obligations 

health care cost trend rates 

 

health care cost trend rates are based on recent plan experience and industry trends the company uses actuarial data to substantiate the inflation assumption for health care costs representing increases in total plan costs which include claims and administrative fee cost components the 2010 and 2009 assumed health care cost trend rate for benefit obligations was 85 for nonmedicareeligible participants and 80 for medicareeligible participants which is expected to decrease gradually until reaching 5 in 2018 based upon current actuarial projections however the yeartoyear comparisons may fluctuate 

other assumptions 

  the calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to mortality rates turnover and retirement age these assumptions are based upon historical data and are selected by management

2011 estimated pension and postretirement expense 

net pension and postretirement benefits expense for 2011 is expected to be approximately 75 million and 26 million respectively compared to 54 million and 32 million respectively in 2010 the increase in the pension expense is primarily related to additional amortization of the losses incurred by the pension plan assets during 2008 and the decrease in the discount rate which causes expense to increase 

the following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effect of changes in certain assumptions like discount rates salaries and health care costs on the 2010 estimated pension and postretirement expense 

 

  

depreciation policies for assets utilizing the grouplife method 

the company depreciates its rail assets including mainline track locomotives and freight cars using the grouplife method of accounting assets depreciated under the grouplife method comprise over 87 of total fixed assets of 32 billion on a gross basis at december 2010 all other assets of the company are depreciated on a straightline basis the grouplife method aggregates assets with similar lives and characteristics into groups and depreciates each of these groups as a whole when using the grouplife method an underlying assumption is that each group of assets as a whole is used and depreciated to the end of its recoverable life 

the company currently utilizes more than 130 different depreciable asset categories to account for depreciation expense for the railroad assets that are depreciated under the grouplife method of accounting examples of depreciable asset categories include 18 different categories for crossties due to the different combinations of density classifications and asset types by utilizing various depreciable categories the company can more accurately account for the use of its assets 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates continued 

the company believes the grouplife method of depreciation closely approximates the straightline method of depreciation additionally due to the nature of most of its assets eg track is one contiguous connected asset the company believes that this is the most effective way to properly depreciate its assets 

under the grouplife method of accounting the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic life studies and applying managements assumptions regarding the service lives of its properties a life study is the periodic review of asset lives for group assets conducted by a thirdparty specialist analyzed by the company’s management and approved by the surface transportation board “stb” the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices the stb requires life studies be performed for equipment assets every three years and for road eg bridges and signals and track eg rail ties and ballast assets every six years the company believes the frequency currently required by the stb provides adequate review of asset lives and that a more frequent review would not result in a material change due to the longlived nature of most of the assets 

changes in asset lives due to the results of the life studies are applied on a prospective basis and could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense and thus the companys results of operations 

there are several factors taken into account during the life study and they include

for retirements or disposals of depreciable rail assets that occur in the ordinary course of business the asset cost net of salvage value or sales proceeds is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized as individual assets within a specific group are retired resulting gains and losses are recorded in accumulated depreciation as part of the life study an assessment of the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is made to determine if it is deficient or in excess of the appropriate amount indicated by the study any such deficiency or excess including any deferred gains or losses is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining useful life of the asset group until the next required life study since the overall assumption with grouplife is that the assets within the group on average have the same life and characteristics it is therefore concluded that the deferred gains and losses offset over time 

in the event that large groups of assets are removed from service as a result of unusual acts or sales resulting gains and losses are recognized immediately these acts are not considered to be in the normal course of business and are therefore recognized when incurred examples of such acts would be the major destruction of assets due to significant storm damage eg major hurricanes the sale of a rail line segment to another railroad or the disposal of an entire class of assets eg disposal of all refrigerated freight cars 

recent experience with life studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes which did not materially affect the company’s annual depreciation expense of 947 million and 903 million for 2010 and 2009 respectively a 1 change in the average life of all grouplife assets would result in a 9 million change to the company’s annual depreciation expense the company completed life studies for its equipment assets in 2009 and concluded life studies for its road track and equipment assets in 2008 resulting in a reduction in depreciation expense of 11 million in 2010 and 18 million in 2009 

income taxes 

csx accounts for income taxes in accordance with the income taxes topic in the asc that addresses how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under this topic the company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution

company history 

 

a leader in freight rail transportation for more than 180 years the company’s roots date back to the early nineteenth century when the baltimore and ohio railroad company “bo” – the nation’s first common carrier – was chartered in 1827 since that time the company has built on the foundation laid by early pioneers who had a vision to create a railroad that could safely and reliably service the everincreasing demands of a growing nation 

since its founding numerous railroads have combined with the former bo through merger and consolidation to create what has become csx each of the railroads that combined into the csx family brought unique and valuable geographical reach to new markets gateways cities ports and transportation corridors 

csx was incorporated in 1978 under virginia law in 1980 the company completed the merger of the chessie system “chessie” and seaboard coast line industries “seaboard” into csx the merger allowed the company to connect northern population centers and appalachian coal fields to growing southeastern markets in 1986 the chessie and seaboard operating entities were transferred to the rail entity csxt which was created through the merger intermodal was originally formed in 1986 in order to provide nationwide doortodoor intermodal service 

 

in 1997 csxt and norfolk southern railway jointly acquired the rights to operate conrail inc “conrail” and then in 2004 csxt acquired an allocated portion of conrail’s assets which csxt operated conrail was formed in 1976 from several financially troubled northeast railroads to restructure and revive the region’s railroads the company’s acquisition of key portions of conrail allows csxt to link the northeast including new england and the new york metropolitan area with chicago midwest markets and the growing areas in the southeast that were already served by csxt this current rail network allows the company to directly serve every major market in the eastern united states with safe dependable environmentally friendly and fuel efficient freight transportation and intermodal service 

csx corporation 

part i 

regulatory environment 

the companys operations are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to many businesses in the united states the railroad operations conducted by the companys subsidiaries including csxt are subject in many respects to the regulatory jurisdiction of the surface transportation board “stb” the federal railroad administration “fra” and its sister agency within the us department of transportation “dot” the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration “phmsa” together fra and phmsa have broad jurisdiction over railroad operating standards and practices including track freight cars and locomotives and hazardous materials requirements additionally the transportation security administration “tsa” a component of the department of homeland security “dhs” has broad authority over railroad operating practices that may include homeland security implications 

decisions and rulemaking by these and other agencies can significantly affect the company’s operations and profitability for example in 2008 both dot and tsa issued rules that apply to the transportation of certain kinds of highly hazardous materials the dot rules require railroads to analyze routes used to transport these products and to apply specific criteria in selecting routes to be used the new tsa rules place significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail in some cases state and local laws and regulations can be preempted in their application to railroads by the operation of these and other federal authorities 

although the staggers act of 1980 significantly deregulated rail rates and much of the rail traffic of the companys subsidiaries is currently exempt from rate regulation by agency decision the stb has broad jurisdiction over railroad commercial practices including some railroad rates routes fuel surcharges conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines this includes jurisdiction over freight car charges the transfer extension or abandonment of rail lines rates charged on certain regulated rail traffic and any acquisition of control over rail common carriers 

in 2008 congress enacted the rail safety improvement act the legislation includes a mandate that all class i freight railroads implement a positive train control system “ptc” by december 31 2015 ptc must be installed on all main lines with passenger and commuter operations as well as those over which toxicbyinhalation hazardous materials “tih” are transported implementation of a ptc system is designed to prevent traintotrain collisions overspeed derailments incursions into established workzone limits and a train from diverting offcourse onto another set of tracks through a switch left in a wrong position significant capital costs are anticipated with the implementation of ptc as well as ongoing operating expenses csx estimates that the total cost of ptc implementation will likely exceed 750 million for the company 

 

csx corporation 

part i 

in december 2009 a proposed bill called the “surface transportation board reauthorization act of 2009” “stb reauthorization bill” was introduced in the senate if adopted as proposed this bill could have a material adverse effect on commercial practices and railroad operations the current proposal in the senate contains fundamental changes in laws that were designed to sustain the railroads some of the proposed changes in the stb reauthorization bill are not yet clearly defined and others call for new and broad government involvement into railroad operations csx believes the bill in its current form could have a material adverse effect on the company’s revenue and operations as well as the ability to invest in enhancing and maintaining vital infrastructure csx will continue to work diligently with the senate staff as well as with senators to forge a balanced regulatory approach 

for further discussion on regulatory risks to the company see item 1a risk factors 

 

competition 

 

the business environment in which the company operates is highly competitive shippers typically select transportation providers that offer the most compelling combination of service and price service requirements both in terms of transit time and reliability vary by shipper and commodity as a result the company’s primary competition varies by commodity geographic location and mode of available transportation 

csxt’s primary rail competitor is norfolk southern railway which operates throughout much of the company’s territory other railroads also operate in parts of the company’s territory depending on the specific market competing railroads and deregulated motor carriers may exert pressure on price and service levels for further discussion on the risk of competition to the company see item 1a risk factors

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the company’s forwardlooking statements additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the company or that the company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

new legislation or regulatory changes could impact the company’s earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices 

legislation passed by congress or new regulations issued by federal agencies can significantly affect the revenues costs and profitability of the company’s business for instance legislation proposed in the senate in december 2009 if adopted would significantly change the federal regulatory framework of the railroad industry several of the changes under consideration could have a significant negative impact on the company’s ability to determine prices for rail services meet service standards and would likely force a reduction in capital spending statutes imposing price constraints or affecting railtorail competition could adversely affect the company’s profitability also additional regulations related to environmental matters such as greenhouse gas emissions could increase the company’s operating costs or reduce operating efficiencies or negatively impact the business of csx customers 

government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the company’s operations and financial results 

the company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies including the stb the fra and other state and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic health safety labor environmental tax legal and other matters new rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the company’s operating costs or reduce operating efficiencies for example the rail safety improvement act of 2008 “rsia” imposes limits on employee work hours and may result in higher operating costs for the company the rsia also mandated the installation by december 31 2015 of positive train control ptc on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that have commuter or passenger operations the fra issued its final rule in january 2010 on the design operational requirements and implementation of the new technology the final rule is expected to impose significant new costs on csx and the rail industry noncompliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the company and can subject the company to fines penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions 

csx corporation 

part i 

climate change legislation and regulation could adversely affect the company’s operations and financial results 

regulation or legislation that potentially imposes restrictions caps taxes or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gas could adversely affect operations and financial results more specifically increased energy costs resulting from legislative or regulatory actions could adversely impact csx by 1 making it difficult for csx’s customers in the us to produce products in a cost competitive manner particularly in the absence of similar regulations in countries like india and china 2 increasing csx’s fuel costs and hurting fuel efficiency and 3 reducing the consumption of coal as an energy resource in the united states any of these factors could reduce the amount of traffic handled and have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

csxt as a common carrier by rail is required by law to transport hazardous materials which could expose the company to significant costs and claims 

under federal regulations csxt is required to transport hazardous materials under its common carrier obligation a train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury property damage and environmental penalties and remediation such claims could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates csxt is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials 

in november 2008 the tsa issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail noncompliance with these rules can subject the company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident finally legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances which could result in increased operating costs reduced operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials 

csx corporation 

part i 

the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs 

the company’s operations are subject to wideranging federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions into the air discharges into water the handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases in certain circumstances environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties leased properties adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or company predecessors as well as to properties currently owned and used by the company 

the company has been and may be subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated or is strictly liable under environmental laws or regulations and such violations can result in the company’s incurring fines penalties or costs relating to the cleanup of environmental contamination although the company believes it has appropriately recorded current and longterm liabilities for known future environmental costs it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing the company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination 

general economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight 

 

the current economic environment has adversely affected demand for rail and intermodal services further decline in general domestic and global   economic conditions that affect demand for the commodities the company carries could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects 

 

weaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the company’s access to capital 

 

the company is in a capital intensive industry that requires continuing infrastructure improvements and acquisition of capital assets the company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity adverse conditions in the credit markets could increase the company’s costs associated with issuing debt limit the company’s ability to sell debt securities on acceptable terms and impede the company’s ability to revise its current debt arrangements as contemplated

network congestion could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency 

csxt may experience rail network difficulties related to increased passenger activities in capacityconstrained areas or regulatory changes impacting when   csxt can transport freight or service routes that could have a negative effect on csxt’s operational fluidity leading to deterioration of service asset utilization and overall efficiency 

the company relies on the stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business 

the company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business a significant disruption or failure of the company’s information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment could result in a service interruption safety failure security breach or other operational difficulties the performance and reliability of the company’s technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively 

disruption of the supply chain could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs 

the capital intensive nature and sophistication of core rail equipment including rolling stock equipment locomotives rail and ties limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers if any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage csxt could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage in addition a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and as such adverse developments in international relations new trade regulations disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase csxt’s operating costs 

 

additionally if a fuel supply shortage were to arise whether due to the organization of the petroleum exporting countries or other production restrictions lower refinery outputs a disruption of oil imports or otherwise the company would be negatively impacted 

 

failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes andor work stoppages 

 

most of csxts employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements generally speaking these agreements are bargained nationally by the national carriers committee in the rail industry negotiations have generally taken place over a number of years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages if csxt is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements however it could result in strikes by the affected workers loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members under the railway labor act’s procedures which include mediation coolingoff periods and the possibility of presidential intervention neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted 

csx corporation 

part i 

the company faces competition from other transportation providers 

the company experiences competition in the form of pricing service reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and to a less significant extent barges ships and pipelines transportation providers such as motor carriers and barges utilize public rightsofway that are built and maintained by governmental entities while csxt and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks using largely internal resources any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks could negatively impact the company’s competitive position 

future acts of terrorism war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the company’s operations 

 

terrorist attacks along with any government response to those attacks may adversely affect the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity csxt’s rail lines or other key infrastructure may be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war this risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues in addition premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the company could increase dramatically or the coverage may no longer be available 

 

furthermore in response to the heightened risk of terrorism federal state and local governmental bodies are proposing and in some cases have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry for example the department of homeland security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials complying with these regulations could continue to increase the company’s operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies 

 

severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage 

 

the company’s operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences including floods fires hurricanes and earthquakes as a result the company’s rail network may be damaged its workforce may be unavailable fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur in addition the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions insurance maintained by the company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations depending on the nature of the risk insured this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the company’s damages or damages to others and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates even with insurance if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service the company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations

the company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures 

 

the company is subject to various claims and lawsuits including putative class action litigation alleging violations of antitrust laws the company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits additionally existing litigation may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in the company’s reserve estimates as the ultimate outcome of existing litigation is subject to numerous factors outside of the company’s control while the company uses its best efforts to evaluate existing litigation the final judgments or settlement amounts may differ materially from the recorded reserves 

 

increases in the number and magnitude of property damage and personal injury claims could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

 

the company faces inherent business risk from exposure to occupational and personal injury claims property damage including storm damage and claims related to train accidents the company may incur significant costs to defend such claims 

 

existing claims may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in reserve estimates as the ultimate outcome of existing claims is subject to numerous factors outside of the company’s control although the company establishes reserves and maintains insurance to cover these types of claims final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may differ materially from the recorded reserves and exceed the company’s insurance coverage

coal network   – the csxt coal network connects the coal mining operations in the appalachian region with industrial areas in the northeast and midatlantic as well as many river lake and deep water port facilities coal is used to generate more than half of the electricity in the united states csxt’s coal network is well positioned to supply utility markets in both the northeast and southeast 

interstate 90 i90 corridor – this csxt corridor links chicago and the midwest to metropolitan areas in new york and new england this route also known as the “waterlevel route” has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks referred to as double track these superior engineering attributes permit the corridor to support consistent highspeed intermodal automotive and merchandise service this corridor is a primary route for import traffic moving eastward across the country through chicago and into the population centers in the northeast the i90 corridor is also a critical link between ports in new york new jersey and pennsylvania and consumption markets in the midwest 

interstate 95 i95 corridor – the csxt i95 corridor connects charleston jacksonville miami and many other cities throughout the southeast with the heavily populated northeastern cities of baltimore philadelphia and new york csxt primarily transports food and consumer products as well as metals and chemicals along this line it is the only rail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of washington dc and provides access to major eastern ports 

southeastern corridor – this critical part of the network runs between csxt’s western gateways of chicago st louis and memphis through the cities of nashville birmingham and atlanta and markets in the southeast the southeastern corridor is the premier rail route connecting these key cities gateways and markets and positions csxt to efficiently handle projected traffic volumes of intermodal automotive and general merchandise traffic the corridor also provides direct rail service between the coal reserves of the southern illinois basin and the increasing demand for coal in the southeast

locomotives 

csxt focuses on maximum use of its fleet and prudent investment in new units to drive the rail network better locomotive management can help csxt move freight more efficiently while continued investment in csxt’s power source can enable csxt to operate more locomotives better 

csxt operates more than 4000 locomotives of which over 95 are owned by csxt freight locomotives are the power source used primarily to pull trains switching locomotives are used in yards to sort railcars so that the right railcar is attached to the right train in order to deliver it to its final destination auxiliary units are typically used to provide extra traction for heavy trains in hilly terrain at december 2009 csxt’s fleet of owned and longterm leased locomotives consisted of the following types of locomotives 

 

the table below indicates the number and year built for locomotives owned or on longterm lease at december 2009 

 

as of december 2009 566 locomotives or 14 were held in temporary storage due to significant declines in volume as volume returns these locomotives will be placed back into service after restorative maintenance procedures are performed these locomotives can be brought back into service within a week 

freight car fleet 

the average daily fleet of carsonline consists of approximately 216000 cars but at any time over half of the railcars on the csxt system are not owned or leased by csxt examples of these are railcars owned by other railroads which are utilized by csxt shipperfurnished or private cars which are generally used only in that shipper’s service and multilevel railcars 

csx corporation 

part i 

csxt’s freight car fleet consists of six main types of cars 

gondolas – support csxt’s metals markets and provide transport for woodchips and other bulk commodities some gondolas are equipped with special hoods for protecting products like coil and sheet steel 

opentop hoppers – transport heavy dry bulk commodities such as coal coke stone sand ores and gravel that are resistant to weather conditions 

box cars – include a variety of tonnages sizes door configurations and heights to accommodate a wide range of finished products including paper auto parts appliances and building materials insulated box cars deliver food products canned goods beer and wine 

covered hoppers – have a permanent roof and are segregated based upon commodity density lighter bulk commodities such as grain fertilizer flour salt sugar clay and lime are shipped in large cars called jumbo covered hoppers heavier commodities like cement ground limestone and glass sand are shipped in small cube covered hoppers 

multilevel flat cars – transport finished automobiles and are differentiated by the number of levels bilevels for large vehicles such as pickup trucks and suvs and trilevels for sedans and smaller automobiles 

flat cars – used for shipping intermodal containers and trailers or bulk and finished goods such as lumber pipe plywood drywall and pulpwood 

other cars owned or leased on the network include but are not limited to center beam cars for transporting lumber and building products 

csxt owns more than 60 of its freight cars at december 2009 csxt’s owned and longterm leased freight car fleet consisted of the following 

 

as of december 2009 22952 freight cars or 29 were held in temporary storage due to significant declines in volume as volume returns these freight cars will be placed back into service these freight cars can be brought back into service within a week

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

strategic overview 

csx and the rail industry provide customers with access to an expansive and interconnected transportation network that plays a key role in north american commerce csx’s network is positioned to reach more than twothirds of americans who account for about threequarters of the nation’s consumption of goods the csx rail network spans 21000 miles of track with service to 23 states and the district of columbia and connects more than 70 ocean river and lake ports with major manufacturing and distribution centers in the northeast midwest and south through this network the company transports a broad portfolio of products ranging from coal and new energy sources like biodiesel and ethanol to automobiles chemicals military equipment and consumer products 

in 2009 csx and the rail industry experienced significant freight rail volume declines during this period csx nonetheless was able to make financial and operational improvements by maintaining a focus on safety train operations and cost control csx took aggressive actions to manage costs and rightsize resources to match demand conditions these actions included rightsizing the labor force through furloughs to match decreasing volumes adjusting the one plan to reduce the size of its scheduled train network adjusting the unit train network in order to conserve resources and reducing the number of active locomotives and freight cars to reduce maintenance costs in addition to controlling resources the company stayed focus on striving for high safety standards and continuing to provide strong customer service the company also continues to advance its total service integration “tsi” initiative which aims to optimize train size and increase asset utilization while delivering more reliable service to customers 

in addition to a commitment to strengthening operational efficiency and productivity csx continues to invest in its network to further enhance safety and improve service and reliability for its customers to adequately continue these investments the company must be able to operate in an environment in which it can generate adequate returns and drive shareholder value to that end csx will continue to advocate for a fair and balanced regulatory environment to ensure that the value of csx’s rail service will be reflected in new legislation and policy 

 

as an example of csx’s commitment to investing in its network and improving the flow of freight the company launched the national gateway a multimillion dollar publicprivate infrastructure initiative which will significantly improve the efficiency of the freight network between the midatlantic ports and the midwest when completed the national gateway is expected to reduce truck traffic and increase intermodal capacity on key corridors without increasing the number of trains as a result the company’s customers will benefit from improved service and reliability reduced transport times and expanded access to rail services 

csx corporation 

part ii 

with a blend of improved safety trends productivity gains pricing and prudent investment in the train network and rail efficiency the company has positioned itself to benefit from the gradual economic recovery the company expects to deliver doubledigit earnings per share growth for 2010 this expectation is supported by strong volume and revenue growth including export coal shipments that could approach 30 million tons this year and strong operating ratio improvement as well 

2009 highlights 

 

 

 

 

even with a severe broadbased economic recession csx delivered solid financial results revenues were down 20 from the prior year as a 62 increase in core pricing was offset by a 15 decline in volume and lower fuel surcharge recovery associated with the sharp decline in fuel prices yearoveryear volume declines were experienced across all markets with the exception of the domestic intermodal segment in this challenging environment the company continued to achieve pricing gains primarily due to improved service and the overall cost advantages that railbased solutions provide to customers versus other modes of transportation 

at the same time csx was able to reduce expenses by 17 billion or 20 versus the prior year these expense reductions helped partially offset the revenue decline and were a combined result of lower fuel expense ongoing productivity initiatives and overall cost management efforts because of the company’s continued focus on cost control csx was able to achieve a record operating ratio of 747 

for additional information refer to rail and intermodal results of operations discussed on pages 39 through 42 

in addition to the financial highlights described above the company measures and reports safety and service performance csx strives for continuous improvement in these measures through training initiatives and investment for example the company’s safety and train accident prevention programs rely on broad employee involvement the programs utilize operating rules training compliance measurement root cause analysis and communication to create a safer environment for employees and the public continued capital investment in company assets including track bridges signals equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance 

csx corporation 

part ii 

during 2009 the company continued to advance its efforts on safety and operating performance csxt delivered improved yearoveryear results in both fra personal injuries and train accidents the fra personal injury index declined to 119 a 2 improvement reported fra train accident frequency declined to 277 for a 5 improvement the same results over a five year period show a 49 improvement in the fra personal injury frequency index and a 43 improvement in the fra train accident rate which is attributable to the company’s continuous focus on safety 

key service metrics remained strong in the year ontime train originations and arrivals were 81 and 80 respectively for the year csxt reduced the number of train starts in response to lower demand which resulted in an increase in average dwell to 241 average carsonline declined to 216013 also primarily due to lower demand levels average train velocity improved to 218 miles per hour as the network remained fluid csxt aims to maintain key operating measures and service reliability at high levels while reducing resource utilization in response to current business conditions

in addition to producing strong financial safety and service results csx continued to invest in its business to create longterm value for shareholders in 2009 property additions of 14 billion as well as 160 million of new assets purchased using seller financing were slightly lower than prior year these items are reflected in the investing and financing sections of the cash flow statement respectively the company remains committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for longterm growth through expanding network and terminal capacity as described below free cash flow before dividends decreased 551 million to 670 million this decrease was primarily driven by decreased cash from operations as a result of lower earnings partially offsetting this decrease were fewer property additions in 2009 compared to the prior year csx also maintained the quarterly dividend of 022 throughout 2009 

free cash flow nongaap measure 

free cash flow is considered a nongaap financial measure under sec regulation g disclosure of nongaap measures management believes however that free cash flow is important in evaluating the company’s financial performance and measures an ability to generate cash without incurring additional external financing free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than a substitute for cash provided by operating activities 

free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and certain other investing activities also added to free cash flow is the company’s 42 economic interest in conrail’s free cash flow which is not consolidated in csx amounts

2009 vs 2008 rail results of operations 

rail revenue 

rail revenue which excludes intermodal is categorized by three main lines of business merchandise coal and automotive rail revenue decreased 20 billion or 20 to 78 billion from the prior year driven by an 18 decline in volume and lower fuel cost recovery associated with the sharp decline in fuel prices the broadbased economic recession drove yearoveryear volume declines across all major markets in this challenging environment csxt continued to achieve pricing gains primarily due to improved service and the overall cost advantages that railbased solutions provide to customers versus other modes of transportation 

merchandise 

chemicals – volume declined as weakness in the housing automotive and consumer goods markets significantly reduced demand for chemical products related to those markets revenue per unit was flat as yield management efforts were offset by lower fuel recovery 

emerging markets – volume was down as a result of declines in aggregate shipments such as crushed stone sand and gravel caused by a continued weakness in both residential and nonresidential construction 

forest products – a weak housing market drove the decline in lumber and building products paper volume continued to be soft due to electronic media substitution and less packaging being used as a result of lower consumer spending 

agricultural products  volume was down slightly as the growth in ethanol and export grain was more than offset by lower poultry production which negatively impacted the feed grain and ingredient markets 

metals – the largest decline in volume was experienced in metals driven by weak global and domestic steel demand in the automotive and construction industries the decline in demand moderated during the year due to replenishment of low inventories and an improvement in automotive production 

phosphates and fertilizers – international and domestic shipments declined due to lower phosphate and potash soil application by farmers in reaction to lower prices for grain and the tight credit environment 

food and consumer –weakness in residential construction caused reduced shipments of appliances and other consumer goods yet basic needs markets such as food products were less severely impacted by the economic conditions 

csx corporation 

part ii 

coal 

volume declines were driven by lower demand from electric utilities and a decrease in exports compared to 2008 domestic coal demand for generating electricity was down due to natural gas substitution and lower industrial production resulting in continued high stock pile levels     the 2009 export market decline was a result of both lower steel production in europe reducing the need for metallurgical coal used to produce steel and less expensive alternative global sources for european utilities overall revenue per unit for the coal market improved as yield management efforts more than offset lower fuel recovery 

for 2010 domestic utility demand is expected to remain weak through the first half of the year however export market conditions are improving due to increasing global steel production export coal shipments could approach 30 million tons in 2010 this increase in demand is expected to more than offset   the forecasted   domestic utility coal weakness potentially producing full year gains in overall coal coke and iron ore shipments 

automotive 

volume declined due to a reduction in light vehicle production several plant closures and lower vehicle sales driven by the weak economy and a tight credit environment volume however improved in the second half of the year as inventories stabilized and the cash for clunkers program helped spur sales revenue per unit was negatively impacted by lower fuel recovery associated with the sharp decline in fuel prices 

rail expense 

total rail expenses for 2009 decreased 22 or 16 billion to 57 billion compared to the prior year the description of what is included in each category as well as significant year over year changes is described below 

   

labor and fringe   expenses include employee compensation and benefit programs these expenses are primarily affected by inflation headcount wage rates incentives earned healthcare plan costs and pension and other postretirement plan expenses these expenses decreased 318 million primarily driven by labor productivity initiatives such as employee furloughs and reduced crew overtime lower incentive compensation was partially offset by inflation and other items 

csx corporation 

part ii 

materials supplies and other   expenses consist primarily of materials and contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment and for terminal services at automotive facilities this category also includes costs related to casualty claims environmental remediation train accidents utilities property and sales taxes and professional services materials supplies and other expenses decreased by 403 million in 2009 this decrease is driven by several items the largest impact being a decline in volumerelated expenses improving trends in safety and a decrease in overall casualty claims drove a net favorable adjustment to casualty reserves during 2009 prior year storm and proxyrelated items not repeated in the current year also added to this decrease lastly improved collections and a stabilizing economic environment caused a decrease in bad debt expense this decrease was partially offset by an increase in inflationrelated items in 2009 

fuel expense   includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as nonlocomotive fuel this expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel fuel expense decreased 965 million primarily due to sharply lower fuel prices and lower volume 

depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the cost of a capital asset such as locomotives railcars and track structure over its useful life this expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year depreciation expense increased 4 million primarily due to a slightly larger asset base this increase was largely offset by lower depreciation rates resulting from periodic asset life studies 

equipment and other rents   primarily   includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies net of rents received by csxt for use of csxt equipment this category of expenses also includes lease expenses primarily for locomotives railcars containers and trailers office and other rentals these expenses decreased 28 million mainly due to lower volume and fewer locomotive leases 

inland transportation   expenses included in the rail segment are primarily for amounts paid to csxt from intermodal for shipments on csxt’s network these intercompany charges are eliminated in consolidated results the remaining consolidated amount which fluctuates with volume is expense paid by intermodal to other transportation companies

2009 vs 2008 intermodal results of operations 

intermodal operating income decreased 128 million or 44 to 162 million in 2009 intermodal revenue declined 262 million or 18 to 12 billion due to an 8 reduction in volume and an 11 decline in revenue per unit the volume decline was led by a decrease in international traffic due to the economy which was partially offset by domestic growth in railroad provided container shipments overtheroad truckload conversions and expanded service offerings revenue per unit was lower primarily due to decreased fuel recovery and competitive truck pricing 

intermodal operating expense decreased 11 or 134 million to 10 billion driven primarily by a decline in volume and lower fuel prices purchased transportation expense increased over 2008 due to increased volume in domestic transcontinental traffic 

2009 vs 2008 consolidated results 

interest expense 

interest expense increased 39 million to 558 million due to higher average debt balances in 2009 

other income – net 

other income decreased 66 million to 34 million in 2009 last year’s results included a 30 million noncash adjustment to correct equity earnings from a nonconsolidated subsidiary that was not repeated in the current year this decrease also included lower average cash and investment balances and a lower average rate of return as well as lower income from real estate sales 

income tax expense 

income tax expense decreased 230 million to 624 million primarily due to lower earnings in 2009 

net earnings 

net earnings decreased 213 million to 12 billion and earnings per diluted share decreased 43 to 291 in 2009 this decrease was primarily due to the following factors

rail revenue 

rail revenue which excludes intermodal is categorized by three main lines of business merchandise coal and automotive rail revenue increased 11 billion or 13 to 98 billion in 2008 as compared to prior year csxt was able to achieve continued pricing gains predominantly due to the overall cost and service advantages that the company’s rail based solutions provide to customers versus other modes of transportation higher fuel cost recovery coupled with favorable pricing more than offset volume losses driven by the weakening economy 

merchandise 

chemicals – revenue and revenueperunit improved due to a continued favorable pricing environment and fuel recoveries volume was down as a result of declines in plastic and plastic feedstock shipments driven by weakness in housing automotive and consumer goods markets 

emerging markets – revenue and revenueperunit grew due to continued yield management efforts and favorable fuel recovery volume was down as a result of declines in aggregate shipments such as crushed stone sand and gravel caused by a continued weakness in both residential and nonresidential construction these declines more than offset growth in shipments of scrubber limestone and transportation equipment 

forest products – revenue was flat and volume declined as shipments of building products slowed due to the decline in residential housing starts further driving volume declines was a reduction in printing paper and newsprint as a combination of electronic media substitution and reduced advertising pages affected demand 

agricultural products – revenue and volume increased due to continued growth in ethanol shipments and strong domestic demand in feed ingredients revenueperunit grew as a result of continued focus on yield management and increased fuel recovery 

metals – revenue and revenueperunit increased due to higher fuel recovery and continued pricing actions lower demand for steel due to continued weakness in construction and automobile production resulted in volume declines these declines more than offset growth in shipments of pipe which were driven by increases in drilling activity and pipeline construction 

phosphates and fertilizers – volume declined in phosphate shipments as weak international and domestic demand resulted in plant curtailments revenueperunit increases were driven primarily by yield initiatives and increased fuel recovery 

csx corporation 

part ii 

food and consumer – volume declined with decreased demand for building products appliances and consumer goods driven by the weakening economy and housing market revenueperunit growth resulted from favorable fuel recoveries and yield initiatives 

coal 

favorable pricing and fuel recovery positively influenced revenue and revenueperunit volumes were slightly up as strength in the export and river markets were offset by weakness in electric utility shipments 

automotive 

volume and revenue declined due to a reduction in light vehicle production several plant closures and lower vehicle sales driven by the slowing economy and tight credit environment consistent with the overall automotive market volumes continued to shift to foreign brands produced domestically revenueperunit improved due to yield initiatives and higher fuel recoveries 

rail expense 

total rail operating expenses for 2008 increased 10 or 637 million to 73 billion compared to the prior year the description of what is included in each category is included in the current year’s rail expense section on the previous pages the significant year over year changes are described below 

 

labor and fringe   expenses decreased 26 million primarily driven by reduced staffing levels and lower benefit costs which were mostly offset by wage inflation 

materials supplies and other   expenses increased by 213 million in 2008 primarily due to favorable personal injury reserve benefits in the prior year additionally these costs also increased as a result of inflation proxyrelated items and other items 

fuel   expense increased 503 million due to higher fuel prices during most of the year which more than offset increased fuel efficiency 

depreciation expense increased 30 million primarily due to a larger asset base as a result of higher capital spending this increase was partially offset by lower depreciation rates resulting from periodic asset life studies 

equipment and other rents   expenses decreased 24 million due mainly to lower volume and fewer locomotive leases

2008 vs 2007 intermodal results of operations 

  

intermodal operating income increased to 290 million an increase of 12 or 30 million versus last year improved fuel recovery and a favorable traffic mix boosted revenue per unit and allowed for an 8 increase in revenue despite 2 fewer loads the volume impact of the continued deceleration of international traffic was somewhat offset by domestic growth in railroad provided container shipments overtheroad truckload conversion and shorthaul moves in the southeast 

intermodal operating expense increased 7 or 80 million to 12 billion driven primarily by higher fuel prices and increased purchased transportation expense linked to growth in domestic transcontinental traffic additionally depreciation decreased based on the results of a periodic review of asset useful lives that was completed a year ago 

2008 vs 2007 consolidated results of operations 

interest expense 

interest expense increased 102 million in 2008 to 519 million due primarily to higher average debt balances in 2008 

other income – net 

other income was flat with a decrease of 5 million to 100 million in 2008 lower income from real estate sales as well as lower cash and investment balances in 2008 were offset by a 30 million noncash adjustment to correct equity earnings from a nonconsolidated subsidiary 

income tax expense 

income tax expense increased 142 million to 854 million which was driven by higher operating income in 2008 this increase was partially offset by an 18 million income tax benefit during 2008 principally related to the settlement of federal income tax audits and certain other tax matters 

net earnings 

net earnings increased 29 million to 14 billion and earnings per diluted share increased 035 to 334 in 2008 this increase was primarily due to the following factors

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures including those to implement regulatory and legislative initiatives in order to have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity its balance sheet sources and uses of cash flow and external factors should be reviewed 

material changes in the consolidated balance sheets and significant cash flows 

consolidated balance sheets 

csx’s balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of csx’s balanced approach in deploying its capital for the benefit of its shareholders which includes reinvestment in the company’s existing infrastructure investments in the network and dividends 

net properties increased 525 million since december 2008 due to planned capital expenditures additionally overall longterm debt obligations had a net increase of 177 million due to the new debt issuance of 500 million offset by payments of 323 million during the current year 

total shareholders’ equity increased 792 million during 2009 this increase was mainly attributable to net earnings partially offset by dividend payments of 345 million 

sources and uses of cash 

the company has multiple sources of cash first the company generates cash from operations in 2009 the company generated 21 billion of cash from operating activities which represented an 854 million decrease from the prior year this decrease was primarily driven by less cash generated from rail and intermodal operations and higher pension contributions in 2009 versus 2008 second csx has access to numerous financing sources including a 125 billion fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in may 2012 this facility can be increased by an additional 500 million to 175 billion with the approval of the lending banks see note 9 debt and credit agreements for more information 

csx will also file its shelf registration statement with the sec on february 19 2010 this shelf registration statement is unlimited as to amount and may be used subject to market conditions and csx board authorization to issue debt or equity securities at csx’s discretion while csx seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit csx to sell such debt securities on acceptable terms at any given time or at all 

in 2009 the company entered into a 250 million receivables securitization facility for further details see page 50

among other things the company uses cash for scheduled payments of debt and leases and to pay dividends to shareholders as declared by the board of directors csx paid dividends of 345 million in 2009 which was 37 million more than prior year this increase was primarily due to an increase in the quarterly dividend to 022 per share midway through 2008 net cash used in financing activities decreased primarily as a result of 16 billion of prior year share repurchases that were not repeated in 2009 and was partially offset by less cash received from debt issued in 2009 as compared to 2008 

net cash used in investing activities during 2009 was driven by 14 billion of property additions in addition capital expenditures for 2009 also included 160 million of new assets purchased using seller financing which are included in financing activities on the cash flow statement funds used for property additions are further described below 

 

 

capital spending programs are and have been designed to assure the ability to provide safe efficient and reliable transportation services for 2010 csx plans to spend 17 billion of capital of which 68 will be used to sustain the core infrastructure approximately 200 million or 12 of total capital spending will be applied toward the implementation of unfunded required regulatory projects such as positive train control “ptc” which is approximately 170 million csx intends to fund these capital investments through funds from operations the remaining 20 will be allocated to locomotives freight cars and high return growth or productivity investments such as the national gateway a publicprivate infrastructure initiative to improve network capacity between midatlantic ports and the midwest 

csx is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments csx may revise this estimate as a result of changes in business conditions tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations

although new legislation or regulations such as the stb reauthorization bill or climate change legislation could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors under item 1a of this form 10k it is too early to predict the manner or severity of such impact however the company continues to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce the impact of its operations on the environment including investments in new technologies reducing fuel consumption and increasing fuel efficiency and lowering emissions 

liquidity and working capital 

currently csx is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint the company ended the year with over 1 billion of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments csx also has a 125 billion credit facility with a diverse syndicate of banks that was not drawn on additionally in 2009 the company took advantage of an improvement in capital market conditions and issued 500 million of new debt 

also in 2009 the company entered into a 250 million receivables securitization facility the purpose of this facility is to provide an alternative to commercial paper and a low cost source of shortterm liquidity this facility has a 364day term and expires on september 27 2010 as of the date of this filing csx has not drawn on this facility under the terms of this facility csx transportation and csx intermodal transfer eligible thirdparty receivables to csx trade receivables a bankruptcyremote special purpose subsidiary a separate subsidiary of csx will service the receivables upon transfer the receivables become assets of csx trade receivables and are not available to the creditors of csx or any of its other subsidiaries the cash received in exchange for these receivables when csx trade receivables monetizes them by selling them to thirdparty lenders will be recorded as debt on csx’s consolidated financial statements due to certain optional reduction or prepayment provisions 

working capital can also be considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its shortterm needs csx had a working capital surplus of 705 million and a working capital deficit of 13 million at december 2009 and 2008 respectively the favorable change is primarily due to increased cash balances as a result of new debt issued during 2009 

the company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above a working capital deficit is not unusual for csx or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity the company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due furthermore csx has sufficient financial capacity including its revolving credit facility and shelf registration statement to manage its daytoday cash requirements and any anticipated obligations the company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity

credit ratings 

 

credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies standard  poor’s “sp” and moody’s investors service “moody’s” use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa1 for sp and moody’s respectively a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 

ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sp and moody’s respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be “investment grade” currently csx’s longterm ratings fall within this category if csxs credit ratings were to decline to lower levels the company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt in addition the market’s demand and thus the company’s ability to readily issue new debt could become further influenced by the economic and credit market environment

critical accounting estimates 

  

  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results may differ from those estimates these estimates and assumptions are discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors on a regular basis consistent with the prior year significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

    casualty environmental and legal reserves 

    casualty 

casualty reserves represent accruals for personal injury and occupational injury claims currently no individual claim is expected to exceed the company’s selfinsured retention amount of 25 million per injury in accordance with the contingencies topic in the fasb accounting standards codification “asc” to the extent the value of an individual claim exceeds the selfinsured retention amount the company would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries   these reserves fluctuate based upon the timing of payments as well as changes in independent thirdparty estimates which are reviewed by management most of the claims relate to csxt unless otherwise noted below defense and processing costs which historically have been insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future are not included in the recorded liabilities

personal injury 

 

personal injury reserves represent liabilities for employee workrelated and thirdparty injuries workrelated injuries for csxt employees are primarily subject to the federal employers’ liability act “fela” in addition to fela liabilities employees of other csx subsidiaries are covered by various state workers’ compensation laws the federal longshore and harbor workers’ compensation program or the maritime jones act 

csxt retains an independent actuarial firm to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims and cases an analysis is performed by the independent actuarial firm semiannually and is reviewed by management the methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims it is based largely on csxt’s historical claims and settlement experience actual results may vary from estimates due to the number type and severity of the injury costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation 

claims have shown a continued downward trend in the number of injuries resulting in a continued reduction of the company’s fra personal injury rate this reduction is a direct result of the company’s improvement in safety additionally the trend in the severity of injuries has significantly declined during 2009 the company reduced personal injury reserves by 84 million based on management’s review of the actuarial analysis performed by an independent actuarial firm these reductions were included in materials supplies and other in the consolidated income statements 

occupational 

occupational claims arise from allegations of exposures to certain materials in the workplace such as asbestos solvents which include soaps and chemicals and diesel fuels or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions such as repetitive stress injuries carpal tunnel syndrome and hearing loss 

asbestos 

the company is party to a number of occupational claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the workplace the heaviest possible exposure for employees resulted from work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines that were largely phased out beginning around the 1950s other types of exposures however including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials continued until it was substantially eliminated by 1985 additionally the company has retained liability for asbestos claims filed against the previously owned international container shipping business diseases associated with asbestos typically have long latency periods amount of time between exposure to a disease and onset of the disease which can range from 10 years to 40 years 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates continued 

the company retains a thirdparty specialist with extensive experience in performing asbestos and other occupational studies to assist management in assessing the value of the company’s reserves the analysis is performed by the specialist semiannually and is reviewed by management the objective of the analysis is to determine the number of estimated incurred but not reported “ibnr” claims and the estimated average cost per claim to be received over the next seven years seven years was determined by management to be the time period in which probable claim filings and claim values could be estimated with more certainty 

the company with the assistance of the thirdparty specialist determines its potentially exposed population and it is then able to derive the estimated number of ibnr claims the estimated average cost per claim is then determined utilizing recent actual average cost per claim data and national industry data key elements of the assessment include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates continued 

from these assumptions the company projects the incidence of each type of disease to the estimated population to determine the total estimated number of employees that could potentially assert a claim historical claim filing rates are applied for each type of disease to the total number of employees that could potentially assert a claim to determine the total number of anticipated claim filings by disease type historical dismissal rates which represent claims that were closed without payment are used to calculate the number of future claims by disease type that should be deducted from the total number of anticipated claims finally the number of such claims was multiplied by the average settlement value to estimate the company’s future liability for ibnr asbestos claims 

the estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values were the most sensitive assumptions for this reserve a 1 increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of ibnr claims or the average claim values would result in less than a 1 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted asbestos claims 

other occupational 

for all other occupational claims such as solvents which include soaps and chemicals and diesel fuels or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions such as repetitive stress injuries carpal tunnel syndrome and hearing loss the company retains a thirdparty specialist with extensive experience in performing other occupational studies to assist management in assessing the value of the company’s reserves the analysis is performed by the specialist semiannually and is reviewed by management the objective of the analysis is to determine the number of ibnr claims and the estimated average cost per claim to be paid in future periods with the exception of carpal tunnel management has determined that seven years is the most probable period in which claim filing and claim values could be estimated with more certainty carpal tunnel claims use a threeyear period to estimate the reserve due to the shorter latency period for these types of injuries similar to the asbestos liability estimation process the key elements of the assessment include the following

from these assumptions the company projects the incidence of each type of disease to the estimated population to determine the total estimated number of employees that could potentially assert a claim historical claim filing rates are applied for each type of disease to the total number of employees that could potentially assert a claim to determine the total number of anticipated claim filings by disease type historical dismissal rates which represent claims that were closed without payment are used to calculate the number of future claims by disease type that should be deducted from the total number of anticipated claims finally the number of such claims was multiplied by the average settlement value to estimate the company’s future liability for ibnr asbestos claims 

the estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values were the most sensitive assumptions for this reserve a 1 increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of ibnr claims or the average claim values would result in less than a 1 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted other occupational claims 

 

during 2009 the company reduced its reserves for asbestos and occupational injuries by 43 million asbestos reserve reductions of 24 million were primarily related to approximately 1500 claims that were based on unreliable medical evidence and therefore have been determined to have no value the remaining reduction is attributable to a decrease in carpal tunnel and repetitive stress injury claims

environmental 

 

the company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 257 environmentally impaired sites many of these are or may be subject to remedial action under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 or cercla also known as the superfund law or similar state statutes most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations a number of these proceedings however are based on allegations that the company or its predecessors sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment or disposal in addition some of the company’s land holdings were leased to others for commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the company 

in any such proceedings the company is subject to environmental cleanup and enforcement actions under the superfund law as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct these costs could be substantial 

in accordance with the asset retirement and environmental obligations topic in the asc the company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least quarterly giving consideration to a number of factors such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based on the review process the company has recorded amounts to cover contingent anticipated future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are estimable and probable the recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted the liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated insurance recoveries payments related to these liabilities are expected to be made over the next several years environmental remediation costs are included in materials supplies and other on the consolidated income statement 

 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates continued 

 

currently the company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities if any on some sites until completion of future environmental studies in addition conditions that are currently unknown could at any given location result in exposure the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reliably estimated based upon information currently available however the company believes its environmental reserves are adequate to fund remedial actions to comply with present laws and regulations and that the ultimate liability for these matters if any will not materially affect its overall financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

legal 

 

in accordance with the contingencies topic in the asc an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated if no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred 

the company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above the amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings newly discovered or developed evidence or changes in laws regulations and evidentiary standards 

    pension and postretirement medical plan accounting 

the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried management personnel the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement for employees hired in 2003 or thereafter benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age service and compensation csx made pension plan contributions of 250 million and 102 million to its qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

in addition to these plans csx sponsors a postretirement medical plan and one life insurance plan that provide benefits to fulltime salaried management employees hired prior to 2003 upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met the postretirement medical plan is contributory partially funded by retirees with retiree contributions adjusted annually the life insurance plan is noncontributory 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates continued 

  the accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the compensation—retirement benefits topic in the asc 

  

  this rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

these assumptions are determined as of the beginning of the year as permitted by the compensationretirement benefits topic the company previously used a plan measurement date of september 30 to actuarially value its pension and postretirement plans during 2008 csx changed its measurement date to its fiscal yearend in accordance with the topic noted above the effect of the change was a 13 million aftertax reduction to retained earnings the company engages independent external actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the company selects the company reviews the longterm rate of return discount salary scale inflation and health care cost trend rates on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends as appropriate 

 

longterm rate of return on plan assets 

 

the expected longterm average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation in estimating that rate the company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment 

 

the companys expected longterm average rate of return on assets considers the current and projected asset mix of the funds management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected longterm rate of return on assets as this assumption is longterm it is adjusted less frequently than other assumptions used in pension accounting the longterm rate of return on plan assets used by the company to value its 2009 and 2008 pension obligation was 85 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates continued 

 

discount rates 

 

discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component of pension and postretirement expense discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other postretirement benefits could be effectively settled or in other words how much it would cost the company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the company’s expected future benefit payments the company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans’ expected benefit payments 

the discount rates used by the company to value its 2009 pension and postretirement obligations are 525 and 475 respectively for 2008 the discount rate used by the company to value its pension and postretirement obligations was 65 discount rates may differ for pension and postretirement benefits due to the different time horizons of future payments for each of the plans as of december 2009 the time horizon for pensions is approximately 11 years while for postretirement the time horizon is approximately 7 years 

each year these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates if interest rates generally decline or rise the assumed discount rates will change 

  salary scale inflation rates 

 

salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the company the company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates the company used a salary scale rate of 40 and 38 to value its 2009 and 2008 pension obligation respectively 

 

health care cost trend rates 

 

health care cost trend rates are based on recent plan experience and industry trends the company uses actuarial data to substantiate the inflation assumption for health care costs representing increases in total plan costs which include claims and administrative fee cost components the 2009 assumed health care cost trend rate for benefit obligations is 85 for nonmedicareeligible participants and 80 for medicareeligible participants which is expected to decrease gradually until reaching 5 in 2017 based upon current actuarial projections however the yeartoyear comparisons may fluctuate for 2008 the assumed health care cost trend rate for benefit obligations was 95 for nonmedicareeligible participants and 105 for medicareeligible participants 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates continued 

other assumptions 

  the calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to mortality rates turnover and retirement age these assumptions are based upon historical data and are selected by management 

2010 estimated pension and postretirement expense 

net pension and postretirement benefits expense for 2010 is expected to be approximately 60 million and 31 million respectively compared to 35 million and 34 million respectively in 2009 the increase in the pension expense is primarily related to the decrease in the discount rate which causes expense to increase and additional amortization of the losses incurred by the pension plan assets during 2008 these increases in expense were partially offset by the 2009 contributions 

the following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effect of changes in certain assumptions like discount rates salaries and health care costs on the 2010 estimated pension and postretirement expense 

 

  

depreciation policies for assets utilizing the grouplife method 

the company depreciates its rail assets including mainline track locomotives and freight cars using the grouplife method of accounting assets depreciated under the grouplife method comprise over 90 of total fixed assets of 31 billion on a gross basis at december 2009 all other assets of the company are depreciated on a straight line basis the grouplife method aggregates assets with similar lives and characteristics into groups and depreciates each of these groups as a whole when using the grouplife method an underlying assumption is that each group of assets as a whole is used and depreciated to the end of its recoverable life 

the company currently utilizes more than 250 different depreciable asset categories to account for depreciation expense for the railroad assets that are depreciated under group life examples of depreciable asset categories include 18 different categories for crossties due to the different combinations of density classifications and asset types by utilizing various depreciable categories the company can more accurately account for the use of its assets 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates continued 

  the company believes the grouplife method of depreciation closely approximates the straightline method of depreciation additionally due to the nature of most of its assets eg track is one contiguous connected asset the company believes that this is the most effective way to properly depreciate its assets 

under grouplife the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic life studies and applying managements assumptions regarding the service lives of its properties a life study is the periodic review of asset lives for group assets conducted by a thirdparty expert analyzed by the company’s management and approved by the surface transportation board “stb” the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices the stb requires life studies be performed for equipment assets every three years and for road eg bridges and signals and track eg rail ties and ballast assets every six years the company believes the frequency currently required by the stb provides adequate review of asset lives and that a more frequent review would not result in a material change due to the longlived nature of most of the assets 

changes in asset lives due to the results of the life studies are applied on a prospective basis and could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense and thus the companys results of operations 

there are several factors taken into account during the life study and they include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

csx corporation 

part ii 

critical accounting estimates continued 

  for retirements or disposals of depreciable rail assets that occur in the ordinary course of business the asset cost net of salvage value or sales proceeds is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized as individual assets within a specific group are retired resulting gains and losses are recorded in accumulated depreciation as part of the life study an assessment of the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is made to determine if it is deficient or in excess of the appropriate amount indicated by the study any such deficiency or excess including any deferred gains or losses is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining useful life of the asset group until the next required life study since the overall assumption with grouplife is that the assets within the group on average have the same life and characteristics it is therefore concluded that the deferred gains and losses offset over time 

in the event that large groups of assets are removed from service as a result of unusual acts or sales resulting gains and losses are recognized immediately these acts are not considered to be in the normal course of business and are therefore recognized when incurred examples of such acts would be the major destruction of assets due to significant storm damage eg major hurricanes the sale of a rail line segment to another railroad or the disposal of an entire class of assets eg disposal of all refrigerated freight cars 

recent experience with life studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes which did not materially affect the company’s annual depreciation expense of 908 million and 904 million for 2009 and 2008 respectively a 1 change in the average life of all grouplife assets would result in a 9 million change to the company’s annual depreciation expense the company completed life studies for its equipment assets in 2009 and concluded life studies for its road track and equipment assets in 2008 resulting in a reduction in depreciation expense of 18 million in 2009 and  32 million in 2008 

 

income taxes 

in 2007 csx adopted accounting guidance in accordance with the income taxes topic in the asc that addressed how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under this topic the company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution the company’s reassessment of its tax positions did not have a material impact on the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity

csx files a consolidated federal income tax return which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries examinations of the federal income tax returns of csx have been completed through 2003 and for 2007 federal income tax returns for 2004 through 2006 currently are under appeal management believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed while the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty it is the opinion of csx management that none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition results of operations or liquidity of csx an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items however could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year also the company is party to a number of legal and administrative proceedings the resolution of which could result in gain realization in amounts that could be material to results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

csx does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes historically the company has used derivative financial instruments to address market risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and the risk of volatility in its fuel costs as of december 2009 the company had 20 million outstanding in interest rate swap agreements a 1 fluctuation in interest rates on these swaps would cause less than a 1 million change in interest expense 

at december 2009 csx had 78 million of outstanding floating rate debt obligations outstanding a 1 fluctuation in interest rates on these notes would cause a 1 million change in interest expense

company history 

 

a leader in freight rail transportation for more than 180 years the company’s roots date back to the early nineteenth century when the baltimore and ohio railroad company “bo” – the nation’s first common carrier – was chartered in 1827 since that time the company has built on the foundation laid by early pioneers who had a vision to create a railroad that could safely and reliably service the everincreasing demands of a growing nation 

since its founding numerous railroads have combined with the former bo through merger and consolidation to create what has become csx each of the railroads that combined into the csx family brought unique and valuable geographical reach to new markets gateways cities ports and transportation corridors 

csx was incorporated in 1978 under virginia law in 1980 the company completed the merger of the chessie system “chessie” and seaboard coast line industries “seaboard” into csx the merger allowed the company to connect northern population centers and appalachian coal fields to growing southeastern markets in 1986 the chessie and seaboard operating entities were transferred to the rail entity csxt which was created through the merger intermodal was originally formed in 1986 in order to provide nationwide doortodoor intermodal service 

in 1997 csxt and norfolk southern railway jointly acquired the rights to operate conrail inc “conrail” and then in 2004 csxt acquired an allocated portion of conrail’s assets which csxt operated conrail was formed in 1976 from several financially troubled northeast railroads to restructure and revive the region’s railroads the company’s acquisition of key portions of conrail allows csxt to link the northeast including new england and the new york metropolitan area with chicago midwest markets and the growing areas in the southeast that were already served by csxt this current rail network allows the company to directly serve every major market in the eastern united states with dependable environmentally friendly and fuel efficient freight transportation and intermodal service

regulatory environment 

the companys operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to many businesses in the united states the railroad operations conducted by the companys subsidiaries including csxt are subject in many respects to the regulatory jurisdiction of the surface transportation board “stb” the federal railroad administration “fra” and its sister agency within the us department of transportation “dot” the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration “phmsa” together fra and phmsa have broad jurisdiction over railroad operating standards and practices including track freight cars and locomotives and hazardous materials requirements additionally the transportation security administration “tsa” a component of the department of homeland security “dhs” has broad authority over railroad operating practices that may include homeland security implications in some cases state and local laws and regulations can be preempted in their application to railroads by the operation of these and other federal authorities 

decisions of these and other agencies can affect the profitability of the company’s business for further discussion on regulatory risks to the company see item 1a risk factors beginning on page 8 

although the staggers act of 1980 significantly deregulated rail rates and much of the rail traffic of the companys subsidiaries is currently exempt from rate regulation by agency decision the stb has broad jurisdiction over railroad commercial practices including some railroad rates this includes jurisdiction over freight car charges the transfer extension or abandonment of rail lines rates charged on certain regulated rail traffic and any acquisition of control over rail common carriers in 2008 for example the stb issued a decision modifying its policies governing certain contractual terms sometimes used in sales of rail lines see note 6 commitments and contingencies for further information 

in 2008 congress enacted the rail safety improvement act the legislation includes a mandate that all class i freight railroads implement a positive train control system “ptc” by december 31 2015 ptc must be installed on all main lines with passenger and computer operations as well as those over which toxicbyinhalation hazardous materials “tih” are transported implementation of a ptc system is designed to prevent traintotrain collisions overspeed derailments incursions into established workzone limits and a train from diverting offcourse onto another set of tracks through a switch left in a wrong position significant capital costs are anticipated with the implementation of ptc as well as ongoing operating expenses 

also in 2008 the tsa issued rules that apply to the transportation of certain kinds of highly hazardous materials the new rules place significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail

competition 

 

the business environment in which the company operates is highly competitive shippers typically select transportation providers that offer the most compelling combination of service and price service requirements both in terms of transit time and reliability vary by shipper and commodity as a result the company’s primary competition varies by commodity geographic location and mode of available transportation 

csxt’s primary rail competitor is norfolk southern railway which operates throughout much of csx’s territory other railroads also operate in parts of csxt’s territory depending on the specific market competing railroads and deregulated motor carriers may exert pressure on price and service levels for further discussion on the risk of competition to the company see item 1a risk factors beginning on page 8 

other information 

csx makes available on its website wwwcsxcom  free of charge its annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission “sec” additionally the company has posted its code of ethics on its website which is also available to any shareholder who requests it this form 10k and other sec filings made by csx are also accessible through the sec’s website at wwwsecgov  

csx has included the certifications of its chief executive officer “ceo” and the chief financial officer “cfo” regarding the company’s public disclosure required by section 302 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “the act” as exhibit 31 as well as section 906 of the act as exhibit 32 to this form 10k report additionally on october 23 2008 csx filed its annual ceo certification with the new york stock exchange “nyse” confirming csx’s compliance with the nyse corporate governance listing standards the ceo was not aware of any violations of these standards by csx as of january 30 2009 the latest practicable date that is closest to the filing of this form 10k this certification is also included as exhibit 99 to this form 10k

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the company’s forwardlooking statements although the risks described below are those that management believes are the most significant these are not the only risks facing the company additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the company or that the company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

new legislation or regulatory changes could impact the company’s earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices 

political changes could result in legislative or regulatory changes that impose new burdens on the company increase operating costs reduce operating efficiency or limit revenues legislation passed by congress or new regulations issued by federal agencies can significantly affect the revenues costs and profitability of the company’s business the railroad industry is vulnerable to economic reregulation by congress which could have a significant negative impact on the company’s ability to determine prices for rail services and would likely force a reduction in capital spending for example statutes imposing price or labor constraints or affecting railtorail competition could adversely affect the company’s profitability also additional regulations related to environmental matters such as greenhouse gas emissions could increase the company’s operating costs or reduce operating efficiencies or impact the business of csx customers 

government regulation and compliance risks may affect the company’s operations and financial results 

the company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies including the stb the fra and other state and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic health safety labor environmental tax legal and other matters the fra regulates several of the company’s core operations including track and mechanical equipment standards signaling systems inspection of grade crossing warning devices locomotive engineer certifications and employee injury reporting among other areas 

in addition the dot and dhs have crafted rules requiring new safety measures and security protocols these regulations will increase operational costs and affect freight transportation routes legislation recently enacted by congress will also increase compliance risks the rail safety improvement act of 2008 imposes limits on employee work hours and may result in higher operating costs for the company 

noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the company and can subject the company to fines penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions in addition a change in these regulations could increase operating costs and reduce operating efficiency

general economic conditions could negatively impact demand for commodities and other freight 

 

the current economic environment has impacted demand for rail and intermodal services further decline in general domestic and global   economic conditions that affect demand for the commodities that the company carries or that lead to bankruptcies or liquidations of one or more large customers of the company could reduce the company’s revenues increase its bad debt expense reduce its ability to make capital expenditures or have other adverse effects because certain of the company’s customers are in the automotive housing and other industries continued weakness or further downturns in these sectors could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

 

weaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the company’s access to capital 

 

the company is in a capital intensive industry that requires continuing infrastructure improvements and acquisition of capital assets the company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity credit markets have recently experienced adverse conditions increasing the costs associated with issuing debt these conditions may further increase the company’s funding costs limit the company’s ability to sell debt securities on acceptable terms and impede the company’s attempts to revise its current debt arrangements as contemplated 

 

csxt as a common carrier by rail is required by law to transport hazardous materials which could expose the company to significant costs and claims 

under federal regulations csxt is required to transport hazardous materials under its common carrier obligation a train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury property damage and environmental penalties and remediation such claims could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates csxt is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials 

in november 2008 the tsa issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail noncompliance with these rules can subject the company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident finally legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances which could result in increased operating costs reduced operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials 

 

csx corporation 

part i 

 

future acts of terrorism war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the company’s operations 

 

terrorist attacks along with any government response to those attacks may adversely affect the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity csxt’s rail lines or other key infrastructure may be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war this risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues in addition premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the company could increase dramatically or the coverage may no longer be available 

 

furthermore in response to the heightened risk of terrorism federal state and local governmental bodies are proposing and in some cases have adopted various legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry for example the dhs adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials complying with these regulations could continue to increase the company’s operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies 

the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs 

the company’s operations are subject to wideranging federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions into the air discharges into water the handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases in certain circumstances environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties leased properties adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or company predecessors as well as to properties currently owned and used by the company 

the company has been and may be subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated or is strictly liable under environmental laws or regulations and such violations can result in the company’s incurring fines penalties or costs relating to the cleanup of environmental contamination   although the company believes it has appropriately recorded current and longterm liabilities for known future environmental costs it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing and may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination

severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage 

 

the company’s operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences including floods fires hurricanes and earthquakes insurance maintained by the company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to limitations on coverage depending on the nature of the risk insured against this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the company’s damages or damages to others and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates even with insurance if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service the company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations 

 

the company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures 

 

the company is subject to various existing lawsuits including putative class action litigation alleging violations of antitrust laws and potential unknown litigation the company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend any such lawsuits additionally existing litigation may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in the company’s reserve estimates as the ultimate outcome of existing litigation is subject to numerous factors outside of the company’s control while the company uses its best efforts to evaluate existing litigation the final judgments or settlement amounts may differ materially from the recorded reserves 

 

increases in the number and magnitude of property damage and personal injury claims could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company faces inherent business risk from exposure to property damage occupational injury claims and personal injury claims resulting from train accidents worker injury claims under the federal employers’ liability act “fela” and claims from outside parties resulting from the company’s operations the company could experience material property damage personal injury or occupational claims in the future and it may incur significant costs to defend such claims 

 

existing claims may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in reserve estimates as the ultimate outcome of existing claims is subject to numerous factors outside of the company’s control although the company establishes reserves and maintains insurance to cover these types of claims final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may differ materially from the recorded reserves and exceed the company’s insurance coverage 

 

 

csx corporation 

part i 

 

failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes andor work stoppages 

 

most of csxts employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements generally speaking these agreements are bargained nationally by the national carriers committee in the rail industry negotiations have generally taken place over a number of years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages over the last 30 years there were only six days of work stoppage related to labor disputes over national handling if the company is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements it could result in strikes by the affected workers loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members under the railway labor act’s procedures which include mediation coolingoff periods and the possibility of presidential intervention neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted 

the company faces competition from other transportation providers 

the company experiences competition in the form of pricing service reliability and other factors from other transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and to a less significant extent barges ships and pipelines transportation providers such as motor carriers and barges utilize public rightsofway that are built and maintained by governmental entities while csxt and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks using largely internal resources any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks could negatively impact the company’s competitive position 

network congestion could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency 

the company may experience rail network difficulties related to network capacity unplanned increases in demand for rail service increased passenger activities in capacityconstrained areas or regulatory changes impacting when csxt can transport freight or service routes that could have a negative effect on the company’s operational fluidity leading to deterioration of service asset utilization and overall efficiency 

the company relies on the stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business 

the company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business a significant disruption or failure of the company’s information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment could result in a service interruption safety failure security breach or other operational difficulties while the company has taken steps to mitigate these risks the performance and reliability of its technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete effectively 

 

csx corporation 

part i 

disruption of the supply chain could negatively impact operating efficiency and increase costs 

the capital intensive nature and sophistication of core rail equipment including rolling stock equipment locomotives rail and ties limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers if any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage the company could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage in addition a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign adverse developments in international relations new trade regulations disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase the company’s operating costs 

additionally if a fuel supply shortage were to arise whether due to the organization of the petroleum exporting countries or other production restrictions lower refinery outputs a disruption of oil imports or otherwise the company would be negatively impacted

rail property 

csxt’s properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure locomotives and freight cars these categories and the geography of the network are described below 

track and infrastructure 

serving 23 states the district of columbia and the canadian provinces of ontario and quebec the csxt rail network serves among other markets new york philadelphia and boston in the northeast and midatlantic the southeast markets of atlanta miami and new orleans and the midwestern cities of st louis memphis and chicago 

csxt’s track structure includes main thoroughfares connecting terminals and yards known as mainline track track within terminals and switching yards track adjacent to the mainlines used for passing trains track connecting the mainline track to customer locations and track that diverts trains from one track to another known as turnouts total track miles are greater than the company’s approximately 21000 route miles which reflect the size of csxt’s rail network that connects markets customers and western railroads at december 2008 the breakdown of track miles was as follows 

 

in addition to its physical track structure csxt operates numerous yards and terminals these serve as the hubs between csxt and its local customers and as sorting facilities where rail cars often are received resorted and placed onto new outbound trains

the following 36 yards are identified as key to the csxt system listed in alphabetical order by state 

 

for a list of intermodal’s terminals see page 18 

network geography 

csxt’s rail operations are primarily focused on four major transportation networks and corridors which are defined geographically and by commodity flows below 

coal network   – the csxt coal network connects the coal mining operations in nine eastern states with industrial areas in the northeast and midatlantic as well as many river lake and deep water port facilities coal is used to generate more than half of the electricity in the united states csxt’s coal network is well positioned to supply utility markets in both the northeast and southeast 

southeastern corridor – this critical part of the network runs between csxt’s western gateways of chicago st louis and memphis through the cities of nashville birmingham and atlanta and markets in the southeast the corridor provides direct rail service between the coal reserves of the southern illinois basin and the increasing demand for coal in the southeast the southeastern corridor is the premier rail route connecting these key cities gateways and markets and positions csxt well to efficiently handle projected traffic volumes of intermodal coal automotive and general merchandise traffic 

 

csx corporation

interstate 90 i90 corridor – this csxt corridor links chicago and metropolitan areas in new york and new england this route also known as the “waterlevel route” has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks referred to as double track these superior engineering attributes permit the corridor to support consistent highspeed intermodal automotive and merchandise service this corridor is a primary route for import traffic moving eastward across the country through chicago and into the population centers in the northeast the i90 corridor is also a critical link between ports in new york new jersey and pennsylvania and consumption markets in the midwest 

interstate 95 i95 corridor – the csxt i95 corridor connects charleston jacksonville miami and many other cities throughout the southeast with the heavily populated northeastern cities of baltimore philadelphia and new york csxt primarily transports food and consumer products as well as metals and chemicals along this line it is the only rail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of washington dc and provides access to all the major eastern ports 

locomotives 

csxt focuses on maximum use of its fleet and prudent investment in new units to drive the rail network better locomotive management can help csxt move freight more efficiently while continued investment in csxt’s power source can enable csxt to operate more locomotives better 

csxt operates more than 4000 locomotives of which over 95 are owned by csxt freight locomotives are the power source used primarily to pull rail cars switching locomotives are used in yards to sort railcars so that the right railcar gets attached to the right train in order to get it to its final destination auxiliary units are typically used to provide extra traction for heavy trains in hilly terrain at december 2008 csxt’s fleet of owned and longterm leased locomotives consisted of the following types of locomotives

the table below indicates the number and year built for locomotives owned or on longterm lease at december 2008 

 

freight car fleet 

the average daily fleet of carsonline consists of approximately 224000 cars but at any point in time over half of the railcars on the csxt system are not owned or leased by csxt examples of these are railcars owned by other railroads which are utilized by csxt shipperfurnished or private cars which are generally used only in that shipper’s service and multilevel railcars 

csxt’s freight car fleet consists of six main types of cars 

gondolas – support csxt’s metals markets and provide transport for woodchips and other bulk commodities some gondolas are equipped with special hoods for protecting products like coil and sheet steel 

opentop hoppers – transport heavy dry bulk commodities such as coal coke stone sand ores and gravel that are resistant to weather conditions 

box cars – include a variety of tonnages sizes door configurations and heights to accommodate a wide range of finished products including paper auto parts appliances and building materials insulated box cars deliver food products canned goods beer and wine 

covered hoppers – have a permanent roof and are segregated based upon commodity density lighter bulk commodities such as grain fertilizer flour salt sugar clay and lime are shipped in large cars called jumbo covered hoppers heavier commodities like cement ground limestone and glass sand are shipped in small cube covered hoppers 

multilevel flat cars – transport finished automobiles and are differentiated by the number of levels bilevels for large vehicles such as pickup trucks and suvs and trilevels for sedans and smaller automobiles 

flat cars – used for shipping intermodal containers and trailers or bulk and finished goods such as lumber pipe plywood drywall and pulpwood

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

strateg ic overview 

the company provides customers with access to an expansive and interconnected transportation network that links ports production facilities and distribution centers to markets in the northeast midwest and southern states the company serves major markets in the eastern united states and has direct access to all atlantic and gulf coast ports as well as the mississippi river the great lakes and the st lawrence seaway the company also has access to pacific ports through alliances with western railroads overall the csxt transportation network encompasses approximately 21000 route miles of track in 23 states the district of columbia and the canadian provinces of ontario and quebec 

the company transports a broad portfolio of products ranging from coal to new energy sources such as ethanol to automobiles chemicals and consumer electronics those goods are transported across the country in a way that minimizes the impact on the environment takes traffic off an already congested highway system and minimizes fuel consumption and transportation costs 

the company’s transportation network serves some of the largest population centers in the nation more than twothirds of americans live within the company’s service territory accounting for about threequarters of the nation’s consumption with a mix of pricing productivity gains and prudent investment in train network and rail efficiency the company will position itself to take full advantage of an eventual economic recovery 

over the past five years the company has made substantial strides in improving operating performance in 2004 csxt implemented the one plan which is being updated to drive greater network efficiencies the company also continues to advance its total service integration “tsi” initiative which aims to better align the company’s capabilities with customer demands tsi aims to optimize train size and increase asset utilization while delivering more reliable service to customers increases in train size reduce the overall number of shipments resulting in less network congestion and idle time for locomotives and reduce loading and unloading time for customers these efforts combined with other efficiencies have resulted in substantial improvements in the company’s operating income operating ratiomargin and free cash flow 

 

csx corporation

in 2008 the company launched the national gateway a multimillion dollar publicprivate infrastructure initiative to create a more efficient freight transportation link between the midatlantic ports and the midwest when completed the national gateway will provide greater capacity for product shipments in and out of the midwest reduce truck traffic on already crowded highways and create new jobs 

the global recession that intensified in late 2008 will continue to impact csx’s business in 2009 and rail volume will be lower for the year beginning in late december the company began taking aggressive actions to manage costs and rightsize resources to match demand conditions the company has made adjustments to the one plan to reduce the size of its scheduled train network in order to conserve resources as a result the company has begun furloughing employees which is a temporary layoff who will return to work when business conditions improve additionally the company has reduced the number of active locomotives on its network and has placed older locomotives in storage to reduce maintenance costs the company will continue to modify the one plan and adjust resources accordingly in order to seek to maximize efficiencies in the current business environment

2008 highlights 

 

 

 

 

despite a challenging economy in the later part of 2008 csx delivered solid financial results revenue and revenue per unit increased 12 and 17 respectively from a year ago reflecting yield management initiatives and higher fuel recovery due to higher fuel prices during most of the year under csxt’s fuel surcharge program csxt bills the customer on a two month lag for fuel this lag creates higher fuel recovery in a period when fuel prices are declining conversely this lag creates lower fuel recovery in a period when fuel prices are increasing 

these positive results in revenue were achieved despite volume declines in three of the company’s four lines of business the overall 4 volume decrease versus last year was primarily driven by continued weakness in the merchandise market relating to housing construction and associated markets as well as declines in automotive production 

for additional information refer to rail and intermodal results of operations discussed on pages 38 through 40 

throughout 2008 the company continued its focus on safety and operating performance leadership and high levels of employee commitment to the company’s safety programs delivered solid improvement in both fra personal injury and train accident frequencies personal injury frequency improved to a record 114 a 7 improvement compared to 2007 fra train accident frequency fell to 268 an 11 improvement versus the prior year 

the company’s safety and train accident prevention programs rely on broad employee involvement the programs utilize operating rules training compliance measurement root cause analysis communication structured competition and leadership to create a safer environment for employees and the public continued capital investment in company assets including track bridges signals and detection technology also supports improved safety performance

in addition to producing sound financial safety and service results csx continued to focus on investing in its business and creating longterm value for shareholders during 2008 the company has taken a balanced approach in deploying its capital through strategic investment share repurchases and increased dividends for the benefit of shareholders 

capital expenditures of 17 billion in 2008 were slightly lower than prior year the company remains committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for longterm growth through expanding network and terminal capacity as described below free cash flow before dividends increased 845 million to 12 billion this increase was primarily driven by increased cash from operations which were a result of higher earnings 

csx also steadily increased the quarterly dividend in 2008 first csx increased its quarterly dividend from 015 to 018 during the second quarter of 2008 it then increased the dividend again during the third quarter of 2008 to 022 which represented a 47 increase from the quarterly dividend level at fourth quarter 2007 additionally csx completed 125 billion of its 3 billion share repurchase program announced during 2008 see note 1 nature of operations and significant accounting policies 

nongaap reconciliation 

free cash flow is considered a nongaap financial measure under sec regulation g disclosure of nongaap measures management believes however that free cash flow is important in evaluating the company’s financial performance and measures an ability to generate cash without incurring additional external financing free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than a substitute for cash provided by operating activities 

free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and certain other investing activities also added to free cash flow is the company’s 42 economic interest in conrail’s free cash flow which is not consolidated in csx amounts

2008 vs 2007 rail results of operations 

rail operating revenue 

rail revenue which excludes intermodal is categorized by three main lines of business merchandise coal and automotive rail revenue increased 11 billion or 13 to 98 billion in 2008 as compared to prior year csxt was able to achieve continued pricing gains predominantly due to the overall cost and service advantages that the company’s rail based solutions provide to customers versus other modes of transportation higher fuel cost recovery coupled with favorable pricing more than offset volume losses driven by the weakening economy 

merchandise 

chemicals – revenue and revenueperunit improved due to a continued favorable pricing environment and fuel recoveries volume was down as a result of declines in plastic and plastic feedstock shipments driven by weakness in housing automotive and consumer goods markets 

emerging markets – revenue and revenueperunit grew due to continued yield management efforts and favorable fuel recovery volume was down as a result of declines in aggregate shipments such as crushed stone sand and gravel caused by a continued weakness in both residential and nonresidential construction these declines more than offset growth in shipments of scrubber limestone and transportation equipment 

forest products – revenue was flat and volume declined as shipments of building products slowed due to the decline in residential housing starts further driving volume declines was a reduction in printing paper and newsprint as a combination of electronic media substitution and reduced advertising pages affected demand 

agricultural products – revenue and volume increased due to continued growth in ethanol shipments and strong domestic demand in feed ingredients revenueperunit grew as a result of continued focus on yield management and increased fuel recovery 

metals – revenue and revenueperunit increased due to higher fuel recovery and continued pricing actions lower demand for steel due to continued weakness in construction and automobile production resulted in volume declines these declines more than offset growth in shipments of pipe which were driven by increases in drilling activity and pipeline construction 

phosphates and fertilizers – volume declined in phosphate shipments as weak international and domestic demand resulted in plant curtailments revenueperunit increases were driven primarily by yield initiatives and increased fuel recovery 

 

csx corporation 

part ii 

food and consumer – volume declined with decreased demand for building products appliances and consumer goods driven by the weakening economy and housing market revenueperunit growth resulted from favorable fuel recoveries and yield initiatives 

coal 

favorable pricing and fuel recovery positively influenced revenue and revenueperunit volumes were slightly up as strength in the export and river markets were offset by weakness in electric utility shipments 

automotive 

volume and revenue declined due to a reduction in light vehicle production several plant closures and lower vehicle sales driven by the slowing economy and tight credit environment consistent with the overall automotive market volumes continued to shift to foreign brands produced domestically revenueperunit improved due to yield initiatives and higher fuel recoveries 

rail operating expense 

total rail operating expenses for 2008 increased 10 or 637 million to 73 billion compared to the prior year the description of what is included in each category as well as significant year over year changes is described below 

labor and fringe   expenses include employee compensation and benefit programs these expenses are primarily affected by inflation headcount wage rates incentives earned healthcare plan costs and pension and other postretirement plan expenses these expenses decreased 26 million primarily driven by reduced staffing levels and lower benefit costs which were mostly offset by wage inflation 

materials supplies and other   expenses consist primarily of materials and contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment and for terminal services at intermodal and automotive facilities this category also includes costs related to casualty claims environmental remediation train accidents utilities property and sales taxes and professional services materials supplies and other expenses increased by 186 million in 2008 primarily due to favorable personal injury reserve benefits in the prior year additionally these costs increased as a result of inflation proxy contest and related litigation costs and other items 

fuel   expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as nonlocomotive fuel this expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel this expense increased 503 million due to higher fuel prices during most of the year which more than offset increased fuel efficiency 

 

csx corporation 

part ii 

depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the cost of a capital asset such as locomotives railcars and track structure over its useful life this expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year this expense increased 30 million primarily due to a larger asset base as a result of higher capital spending this increase was partially offset by lower depreciation rates resulting from periodic asset life studies 

equipment and other rents   primarily   includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies net of rents received by csxt for use of csxt equipment this category of expenses also includes lease expenses primarily for locomotives railcars containers and trailers office and other rentals these expenses decreased 24 million due mainly to lower volume and fewer locomotive leases 

inland transportation   expense included in the rail segment is primarily for amounts paid to csxt from intermodal for shipments on csxt’s network these intercompany charges are eliminated in consolidated results the remaining consolidated amount is expense paid by intermodal to other transportation companies 

gain on insurance recoveries includes gains on insurance recoveries related to hurricane katrina the decrease of 27 million is attributable to gains recognized in 2007 that were not repeated in 2008 

2008 vs 2007 intermodal results of operations 

intermodal operating income increased to 290 million an increase of 12 or 30 million versus last year improved fuel recovery and a favorable traffic mix boosted revenue per unit and allowed for an 8 increase in revenue despite 2 fewer loads the volume impact of the continued deceleration of international traffic was somewhat offset by domestic growth in railroad provided container shipments overtheroad truckload conversion and shorthaul moves in the southeast 

intermodal operating expense increased 7 or 80 million to 12 billion driven primarily by higher fuel prices and increased purchased transportation expense linked to growth in domestic transcontinental traffic additionally depreciation decreased based on the results of a periodic review of asset useful lives that was completed a year ago 

 

csx corporation

2008 vs 2007 additional consolidated results 

other income expense – net 

other income decreased 192 million to a net expense of 103 million in 2008 primarily due to the recognition of a pretax impairment loss of 166 million related to   the writedown of the investment in the greenbrier resort 

interest expense 

interest expense increased 102 million in 2008 to 519 million due primarily to higher average debt balances in 2008 

income tax expense 

income tax expense increased 75 million to 781 million which was driven by higher operating income in 2008 this increase was partially offset by an 18 million income tax benefit during 2008 principally related to the settlement of federal income tax audits and certain other tax matters 

net earnings 

net earnings increased 29 million to 14 billion and earnings per diluted share increased 35 to 334 in 2008 this increase was primarily due to the following factors

2007 vs 2006 rail results of operations 

rail operating revenue 

rail revenue is categorized by three main lines of business merchandise coal and automotive revenue increased 520 million or 6 to 87 billion in 2007 as compared to prior year csxt was able to achieve continued pricing gains predominantly due to the overall cost and service advantages that the company’s rail based solutions provide to customers versus other modes of transportation these pricing gains more than offset volume weakness in housing construction domestic automobile production and related markets 

merchandise 

chemicals – revenue and revenue per unit improved due to a continued favorable pricing environment overall volume declined slightly driven by reduced chlorine shipments and weakness in propane demand due to a milder winter in 2007 

emerging markets – revenue and revenue per unit grew due to continued yield management efforts volume was down as a result of declines in aggregate shipments such as crushed stone sand and gravel caused by a continued weakness in residential construction 

forest products – revenue and volume declined as shipments of building products and paper slowed due to the decline in residential housing starts and electronic media substitution 

agricultural products – strong domestic demand in feed ingredients and soybean shipments supported growth in volume and revenue ethanol volumes also increased as a result of expanded use in the northeast revenue per unit grew as a result of continued focus on yield management 

metals – revenue and revenue per unit increased due to continued pricing actions lower demand for steel due to weakness in housing construction and domestic automobile production resulted in volume declines 

phosphates and fertilizers – volume was flat as higher domestic demand was offset by a decrease in export shipments favorable mix driven by these volume changes coupled with price increases resulted in significantly improved revenue and revenue per unit 

food and consumer – revenue and volume declines were driven by decreased demand for building products appliances and roofing granules which are used to make shingles 

 

csx corporation 

part ii 

coal 

favorable pricing positively influenced revenue and revenue per unit overall tonnage was flat even though carloads slightly declined due to the use of higher capacity cars allowing the movement of more tons with fewer cars strength in the export market was offset by weakness in utility shipments as stockpiles remain at record high levels 

automotive 

volume declined due to a reduction in light vehicle production several plant closures and lower vehicle sales driven by the slowing economy and tight credit environment consistent with the overall automotive market volumes continued to shift to foreign brands produced domestically 

other rail revenue 

the change is primarily due to increased shipments by the company’s regional railroads and more transloading activities associated with ethanol shipments 

rail operating expense 

total rail operating expenses for 2007 increased 6 or 401 million to 67 billion compared to the prior year the description of what is included in each category as well as significant year over year changes is described below 

labor and fringe   expenses include employee compensation and benefit programs these expenses are primarily affected by inflation headcount wage rates incentives earned healthcare plan costs and pension and other postretirement plan expenses these expenses increased 57 million primarily due to wage and benefit inflation which was partially offset by improved productivity and reduced staffing levels 

materials supplies and other   expenses consist primarily of materials and contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment and for terminal services at intermodal and automotive facilities this category also includes costs related to personal injury claims environmental remediation train accidents utilities property and sales taxes and professional services overall materials supplies and other expenses increased by 94 million in 2007 primarily due to inflation higher train accident related costs and higher environmental costs these costs were partially offset by 99 million of favorable personal injury reserve adjustments during the year this was due to a trend of significant decreases in the number and severity of workrelated injuries for csxt employees since 2003 

 

csx corporation 

part ii 

depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the cost of a capital asset such as locomotives railcars and track structure over its useful life this expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year this expense increased 30 million primarily due to a larger asset base as a result of higher capital spending partially offset by lower depreciation rates resulting from periodic asset life studies 

fuel   expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as nonlocomotive fuel this expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel offset by the effects of any hedging activities this expense increased 103 million primarily due to higher fuel prices and prior year hedge benefits that were not repeated during 2007 due to the expiration of the fuel hedge program 

equipment and other rents   primarily   includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies net of rents received by csxt for use of csxt equipment this category of expenses also includes lease expenses primarily for locomotives railcars containers and trailers office and other rentals these expenses decreased 36 million due mainly to lower volume and fewer locomotive leases 

inland transportation   expense included in the rail segment is for amounts paid to csxt from intermodal for shipments on csxt’s network these intercompany charges are eliminated in consolidated results the remaining consolidated amount is expense paid by intermodal to other transportation companies 

gain on insurance recoveries includes gains on insurance recoveries related to hurricane katrina while gains were recognized in both years the 139 million decrease for 2007 was due to higher cash receipts for lost profits and replacement value of property compared to the value of the property that was damaged in 2006 versus 2007 

2007 vs 2006 intermodal results of operations 

 

intermodal operating income declined 3 or 8 million to 260 million versus last year on 4 lower revenue partially offset by volume related cost savings revenue and volume decreases reflect losses of several international customers the slowing of asian imports throughout the year and mix impact related to growth in new shorthaul domestic traffic other revenue declined 22 million from the termination of an agreement relating to the storage of containers as well as lower general business levels revenue per unit declined slightly with yield gains in the international market being offset by mix changes related to the new shorthaul domestic traffic 

despite rising fuel costs intermodal operating expense declined 4 or 48 million to 11 billion driven by lower car hire expense related to volume and improved operational efficiency additionally depreciation decreased based on the results of a periodic review of asset useful lives

2007 vs 2006 additional consolidated results of operations 

other income 

other income of 89 million in 2007 was relatively flat compared to the prior year 

interest expense 

interest expense increased 25 million to 417 million in 2007 primarily due to higher average debt balances

liquid ity and capital resources 

liquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures in order to have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity its balance sheet sources and uses of cash flow and external factors should be reviewed 

material changes in the consolidated balance sheets 

csx’s balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of csx’s balanced approach in deploying its capital for the benefit of its shareholders which includes reinvestment in the company’s existing infrastructure investments in the network share repurchases and dividends 

longterm debt increased 1 billion to 75 billion driven by debt issuances of 135 billion in 2008 this increase was partially offset by a 464 million decrease in current maturities of longterm debt due mainly to debt repayments and convertible debt being converted into csx common stock 

total shareholder’s equity decreased 637 million during 2008 this decrease was mainly attributable to share repurchases that exceeded net earnings as well as adjustments to other comprehensive income related to unrealized pension losses and the payment of dividends see note 1 nature of operations and significant accounting policies 

sources and uses of cash 

the company has multiple sources of cash first the company generates cash from operations in 2008 the company generated 29 billion of cash from operating activities which represented a 730 million increase from the prior year due to higher cash flow generated from rail and intermodal operations second csx has numerous financing sources including a 125 billion fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in may 2012 this facility can be increased by an additional 500 million to 175 billion with the approval of the lending banks see note 8 debt and credit agreements for more information 

csx also has an effective shelf registration statement on file with the sec that is unlimited as to amount and may be used subject to market conditions and csx board authorization to issue debt or equity securities at csx’s discretion while csx seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit csx to sell such debt securities on acceptable terms at any given time or at all 

 

csx corporation 

part ii 

among other things the company uses cash for share repurchases and scheduled payments of debt and leases csx also uses cash to pay dividends to shareholders as declared by the board of directors csx paid dividends of 308 million in 2008 which was 77 million more than prior year the increase in 2008 was primarily due to csx increasing quarterly dividends to 022 per share csx also repurchased 16 billion of shares in 2008 

 

net cash used by investing activities during 2008 was 14 billion this use of funds was predominately driven by 17 billion of capital additions which are further described below this use of cash was slightly offset by proceeds from sales of shortterm investments 

 

capital spending and maintenance programs are and have been designed to assure the ability to provide safe efficient and reliable transportation services for 2009 csx plans to spend 16 billion of capital of which approximately 90 will be used to sustain the core infrastructure terminals locomotives freight cars and technology the remaining 10 will be allocated to high return growth and productivity investments 

csx is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments csx may revise this estimate as a result of changes in business conditions tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations 

liquidity and working capital 

currently csx is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint the company ended the year with over 700 million of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments csx also has a 125 billion credit facility with a diverse portfolio of banks that was not drawn on additionally in january 2009 the company took advantage of an improvement in capital market conditions and issued 500 million of new debt 

working capital can also be considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its shortterm needs csx had a working capital deficit of 13 million and 180 million at december 2008 and 2007 respectively the favorable change was primarily due to increased earnings 

 

csx corporation 

part ii 

the company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above a working capital deficit is not unusual for csx or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity the company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due furthermore csx has sufficient financial capacity including the credit facility and shelf registration statement to manage its daytoday cash requirements and any anticipated obligations the company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity due to the current economic and credit market environment csx may be unable to access capital due lack of market demand or may experience higher interest costs 

credit ratings 

credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies standard  poor’s “sp” and moody’s investors service “moody’s” use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa1 for sp and moody’s respectively a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 

longterm ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sp and moody’s respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be “investment grade” currently the longterm ratings for csx’s obligations fall within the investment grade band of credit quality 

following csx’s 2008 annual meeting sp issued a release noting its outlook for csx changed to negative as a result of the new board composition however sp further noted it does not anticipate downgrading the rating unless csx is no longer committed to targeting an investment grade capital structure or adopts a more aggressive financial policy moody’s outlook for csx continues to be stable 

if csxs credit ratings were to decline to lower levels the company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt in addition the market’s demand and thus the company’s ability to readily issue new debt could become further influenced by the economic and credit market environment

offbalance sheet arrangements 

for detailed information about the company’s guarantees operating leases and purchase obligations see note 6 commitments and contingencies 

there are no offbalance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

critica l accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results may differ from those estimates these estimates and assumptions are discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors on a regular basis consistent with the prior year significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas 

 

 

 

 

  casualty environmental and legal reserves 

casualty 

casualty reserves represent accruals for personal injury and occupational injury claims currently no individual claim is expected to exceed the company’s selfinsured retention amount to the extent the value of an individual claim exceeds the selfinsured retention amount the company would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries personal injury and occupational claims are presented on a gross basis and in accordance with sfas 5 accounting for contingencies “sfas 5” these reserves fluctuate with changes in estimates provided by independent third parties and reviewed by management and are offset by the timing of payments most of the claims were related to csxt unless otherwise noted 

 

csx corporation 

part ii 

defense and processing costs which historically have been insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future are not included in the recorded liabilities the company is presently selfinsured up to 25 million per injury for personal injury and occupationalrelated claims 

personal injury 

personal injury reserves represent liabilities for employee workrelated and thirdparty injuries workrelated injuries for csxt employees are primarily subject to fela in addition to fela liabilities employees of other csx subsidiaries are covered by various state workers’ compensation laws the federal longshore and harbor worker’s compensation program or the maritime jones act 

csxt retains an independent actuarial firm to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims and cases an analysis is performed by the independent actuarial firm semiannually and is reviewed by management the methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims it is based largely on csxt’s historical claims and settlement experience actual results may vary from estimates due to the type and severity of the injury costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation 

based on management’s review of the actuarial analyses performed by an independent actuarial firm the company reduced personal injury reserves by 99 million during 2007 this reduction is due to a trend of significant decreases in the number and severity of workrelated injuries for csxt employees since 2003 the analyses further indicated an absence of large catastrophic claims since 2003 which also was determined to be a trend these reductions were included in materials supplies and other in the consolidated income statements 

occupational 

occupational claims arise from allegations of exposures to certain materials in the workplace such as asbestos solvents which include soaps and chemicals and diesel fuels or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions such as repetitive stress injuries carpal tunnel syndrome and hearing loss 

asbestos 

the company is party to a number of occupational claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the workplace the heaviest possible exposure for employees was due to work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines that were largely phased out beginning around the 1950s however other types of exposures including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials continued until it was substantially eliminated by 1985 additionally the company has retained liability for asbestos claims filed against the previously owned international container shipping business 

 

csx corporation 

part ii 

the company retains a third party specialist with extensive experience in performing asbestos and other occupational studies to assist management in assessing the value of the company’s claims and cases the analysis is performed by the specialist semiannually and is reviewed by management the objective of the analysis is to determine the number of estimated incurred but not reported “ibnr” claims and the estimated average cost per claim to be received over the next seven years seven years was determined by management to be the time period in which probable claim filings and claim values could be estimated with more certainty 

the company with the assistance of the third party specialist determines its potentially exposed population and it is then able to derive the estimated number of ibnr claims the estimated average cost per claim is then determined utilizing recent actual average cost per claim data and national industry data key elements of the assessment include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

csx corporation 

part ii 

 

from these assumptions the company projects the incidence of each type of disease to the estimated population to determine the total estimated number of employees that could potentially assert a claim historical claim filing rates are applied for each type of disease to the total number of employees that could potentially assert a claim to determine the total number of anticipated claim filings by disease type historical dismissal rates which represented claims that were closed without payment were deducted to calculate the number of future claims by disease type that would likely require payment by the company finally the number of such claims was multiplied by the average settlement value to estimate the company’s future liability for ibnr asbestos claims 

the estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for this reserve a 1 increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of ibnr claims or the average claim values would result in an approximate 1 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted asbestos claims 

other occupational 

the company retains a third party specialist with extensive experience in performing other occupational studies to assist management in assessing the value of the company’s claims and cases the analysis is performed by the specialist semiannually and is reviewed by management similar to the asbestos liability estimation process the key elements of the assessment include the following 

 

 

 

csx corporation 

part ii 

 

 

 

the estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for this reserve a 1 increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of ibnr claims or the average claim values would not result in a material increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted other occupational claims

environmental 

the company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 244 environmentally impaired sites many of those are or may be subject to remedial action under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 or cercla also known as the superfund law or similar state statutes most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations however a number of these proceedings are based on allegations that the company or its predecessors sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment or disposal in addition some of the company’s land holdings were leased to others for commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the company 

in any such proceedings the company is subject to environmental cleanup and enforcement actions under the superfund law as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct these costs could be substantial

in accordance with statement of position 961 environmental remediation liabilities  the company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least once a quarter giving consideration to a number of factors such as 

 

 

 

 

based on the review process the company has recorded amounts to cover contingent anticipated future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are estimable and probable the recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted and include amounts representing the companys estimate of unasserted claims which the company believes to be immaterial the liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated insurance recoveries payments related to these liabilities are expected to be made over the next several years 

currently the company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities if any on some sites until completion of future environmental studies in addition conditions that are currently unknown could at any given location result in exposure the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reliably estimated based upon information currently available however the company believes its environmental reserves are adequate to fund remedial actions to comply with present laws and regulations and that the ultimate liability for these matters if any will not materially affect its overall financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

legal 

in accordance with sfas 5 an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated if no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred

the company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above the amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings newly discovered or developed evidence or changes in laws regulations and evidentiary standards 

pension and postretirement medical plan accounting 

the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried management personnel the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement for employees hired in 2003 or thereafter benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age service and compensation csx made pension plan contributions of 102 million to its qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2008 

in addition to these plans csx sponsors a postretirement medical plan and one life insurance plan that provide benefits to fulltime salaried management employees hired prior to 2003 upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met the postretirement medical plan is contributory partially funded by retirees with retiree contributions adjusted annually the life insurance plan is noncontributory 

the accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in sfas 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132 r “ sfas 158 ” sfas 87 employers accounting for pensions “sfas 87” and sfas 106 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pension “sfas 106” 

sfas 87 requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

csx corporation 

part ii 

these assumptions are determined as of the beginning of the year as permitted by sfas 87 the company previously used a plan measurement date of september 30 to actuarially value its pension and postretirement plans during 2008 csx changed its measurement date to its fiscal year end in accordance with sfas 158 the effect of the change was a 13 million aftertax reduction to retained earnings the company engages independent external actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the company selects the company reviews the longterm rate of return discount salary scale inflation and health care cost trend rates on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends as appropriate 

longterm rate of return on plan assets 

the expected longterm average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation in estimating that rate the company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment 

the companys expected longterm average rate of return on assets considers the current and projected asset mix of the funds management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected longterm rate of return on assets as this assumption is longterm it is adjusted less frequently than other assumptions used in pension accounting the longterm rate of return on plan assets used by the company to value its 2008 pension obligation was 85 

discount rates 

discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component of pension and postretirement expense discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other postretirement benefits could be effectively settled or in other words how much it would cost the company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the company’s expected future benefit payments the company determines the discount rate based on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows matching the plans’ expected benefit payments 

the discount rate used by the company to value its 2008 pension and postretirement obligations is 65 each year these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates if interest rates generally decline or rise the assumed discount rates will change 

 

csx corporation 

part ii 

  salary scale inflation rates 

salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the company the company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates the company used a salary scale rate of 38 to value its 2008 pension obligation 

health care cost trend rates 

health care cost trend rates are based on recent plan experience and industry trends the company uses actuarial data to substantiate the inflation assumption for health care costs representing increases in total plan costs which include claims and administrative fee cost components the current assumed health care cost trend rate is 95 for medicareeligible participants and 85 for nonmedicareeligible participants and is expected to decrease gradually until reaching 5 in 2017 based upon current actuarial projections 

other assumptions 

  the calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to mortality rates turnover and retirement age these assumptions are based upon historical data and are selected by management 

2009 estimated pension and postretirement expense 

net periodic pension and postretirement benefits expense for 2009 is expected to be approximately 44 million and 31 million respectively compared to 33 million and 31 million respectively in 2008 

the following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effect of changes in certain assumptions like discount rates salaries and health care costs on the 2009 estimated pension and postretirement expense

depreciation policies for assets under the grouplife method 

csxt accounts for its rail assets including mainline track locomotives and freight cars using the grouplife method the grouplife method pools similar assets by type and then depreciates each group as a whole under the grouplife method the service lives for each group of rail assets are determined by completing periodic life studies and applying managements assumptions concerning the service lives of its properties these life studies are conducted by a third party expert analyzed by the companys management and approved by the stb life studies for equipment assets are required every three years whereas road and track life studies are required every six years by the stb 

changes in asset lives due to the results of the life studies could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense and thus the companys results of operations factors taken into account during the life study include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the life studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the appropriate amount indicated by the study any such deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining useful life of the asset group until the next required life study 

recent experience with life studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes which did not significantly affect the company’s annual depreciation expense in 2007 csxt initiated life studies for its road equipment and track assets that concluded in 2008 resulting in a reduction in depreciation expense for equipment and road assets and an increase in depreciation expense for track assets 

 

csx corporation 

part ii 

assets depreciated under the grouplife method comprise 93 of csxts total fixed assets of 23 billion on a net basis at december 2008 the company’s depreciation expense for 2008 amounted to 904 million a 1 change in the average life of all grouplife assets would result in a 9 million change to the company’s annual depreciation expense 

income taxes 

in 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued interpretation 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes “fin 48” which became effective for csx beginning in 2007 fin 48 addressed the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under fin 48 the company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution the company’s reassessment of its tax positions in accordance with fin 48 did not have a material impact on the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

csx files a consolidated federal income tax return which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries examinations of the federal income tax returns of csx have been completed through 2003 and for 2007 federal income tax returns for 2004 through 2006 currently are under appeal management believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed while the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty it is the opinion of csx management that none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition results of operations or liquidity of csx an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items however could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year also the company is party to a number of legal and administrative proceedings the resolution of which could result in gain realization in amounts that could be material to results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

csx does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes historically the company has used derivative financial instruments to address market risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and the risk of volatility in its fuel costs but as of december 2008 the company did not have a significant position in derivative financial instruments 

at december 2008 csx had 85 million of outstanding floating rate debt obligations outstanding a 1 fluctuation in interest rates on these notes would cause a 1 million change in interest expense

company history 

 

a leader in freight rail transportation for 180 years the company’s roots date back to the early nineteenth century when the baltimore and ohio railroad “bo” – the nation’s first common carrier – was chartered in 1827 since that time csx has built on the foundation laid by early pioneers who had a vision to create a railroad that safely and reliably services the everincreasing demands of a growing nation 

in those 180 years numerous railroads have combined with the former bo through merger and consolidation to create what has become csx each of the railroads that combined into the csx family brought to csx unique and valuable geographical reach to new markets gateways cities ports and transportation corridors 

csx was incorporated in 1978 under the laws of the commonwealth of virginia in 1980 the company completed the merger of the chessie system “chessie” and seaboard coast line industries “seaboard” into csx the merger allowed csx to connect northern population centers and appalachian coal fields to growing southeastern markets in 1986 the chessie and seaboard operating entities were transferred to the rail entity csxt which was created through the merger intermodal was originally formed in 1986 in order to provide nationwide doortodoor intermodal service 

in 1997 csxt and norfolk southern jointly acquired the rights to operate conrail inc “conrail” and then in 2004 csxt acquired an allocated portion of conrail’s assets which csxt operated conrail was formed in 1976 from several financially troubled northeast railroads to restructure and revive the region’s railroads csx’s acquisition of key portions of conrail allowed csxt to link the northeast including new england and the new york metropolitan area with chicago midwest markets and the growing areas in the southeast that were already served by csxt this current rail network allows the company to directly serve every major market in the eastern united states with dependable environmentally friendly and fuel efficient freight transportation and intermodal service

regulatory environment 

the companys operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to many businesses in the united states the railroad operations conducted by the companys subsidiaries including csxt are subject in many respects to the regulatory jurisdiction of the surface transportation board “stb” and the federal railroad administration “fra” which are both part of the department of transportation “dot” additionally the transportation security administration “tsa” a component of the department of homeland security “dhs” has the authority to issue regulations and other directives that may also affect railroad operations in some cases state and local laws and regulations can be preempted in their application to railroads by the operation of these and other federal authorities 

although the staggers act of 1980 significantly deregulated rail rates and much of the rail traffic of the companys subsidiaries is currently exempt from rate regulation by agency decision the stb has broad jurisdiction over railroad commercial practices this includes jurisdiction over freight car rent the transfer extension or abandonment of rail lines rates charged on certain regulated rail traffic and any acquisition of control over rail common carriers in 2007 for example the stb issued decisions changing its longstanding policy on fuel surcharges its rules for large freight rate cases and a new process for rate cases where smaller amounts are at issue 

the fra and its sister agency within the dot the pipeline and hazardous materials administration have broad jurisdiction over railroad operating standards and practices including track freight cars and locomotives and hazardous materials requirements the tsa has broad authority over railroad operating practices that may have homeland security implications the tsa has proposed regulations that would apply to the transportation of certain kinds of highly hazardous materials decisions of these and other agencies can affect the profitability of the company’s business for further discussion on regulatory risks to the company see item 1a risk factors beginning on page 8 

 

competition 

 

the business environment in which the company operates is highly competitive shippers typically select transportation providers that offer the most compelling combination of service and price service requirements both in terms of transit time and reliability vary by shipper and commodity as a result the company’s primary competition varies by commodity geographic location and mode of available transportation 

csx’s primary rail competitor is the norfolk southern which operates throughout much of csx’s territory other railroads also operate in parts of the territory depending on the specific market competing railroads and deregulated motor carriers may exert pressure on price and service levels for further discussion on the risk of competition to the company see item 1a risk factors beginning on page 8

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the company’s forwardlooking statements although the risks described below are those that management believes are the most significant these are not the only risks facing the company additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the company or that the company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the company’s financial position results of operations and liquidity 

new legislation or regulatory changes could impact the company’s earnings or regulate its ability to independently negotiate prices 

 

the company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies including the stb the fra and other state and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic health safety labor environmental tax legal and other matters legislation passed by congress or regulations issued by these agencies can significantly affect the revenues costs and profitability of the company’s business for example regulations imposing price constraints or affecting railtorail competition could adversely affect the company’s profitability also additional regulations related to environmental matters such as greenhouse gas emissions or legislative changes impacting hours of service requirements could adversely affect the company’s financial position results of operations and liquidity 

csxt as a common carrier by rail is required by law to transport hazardous materials which could expose the company to significant costs and claims 

under federal regulations csxt is required to transport hazardous materials under its common carrier obligation a train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury property damage and environmental penalties and remediation csxt is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials failure to comply with these regulations can subject the company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident finally legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances 

the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs 

the company’s operations are subject to wideranging federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions into the air discharges into water the handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases in certain circumstances environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties leased properties adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or company predecessors as well as to properties currently owned and used by the company 

csx corporation 

part i 

the company has been and may be subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated or is strictly liable under environmental laws or regulations and such violations can result in the company’s incurring fines penalties or costs relating to the cleanup of environmental contamination   although the company believes it has appropriately recorded current and longterm liabilities for known future environmental costs it could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing and may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination 

 

general economic geopolitical and compliance risks may affect the company’s operations and financial results 

 

changes in general economic conditions that affect demand for rail or intermodal services could adversely affect the company’s financial position results of operations and liquidity in addition abrupt political change or terrorist activity poses a risk of general economic disruption and could require changes in the operations and security arrangements thus increasing the operating costs these conditions may lend additional uncertainty to the timing and purchasing decisions by the company’s customers 

 

fuel prices and supply are influenced by international political and economic circumstances although a fuel recovery program is in place with a considerable number of customers the company could be negatively impacted if it were unable to realize fuel surcharges additionally if a fuel supply shortage were to arise whether due to the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec or other production restrictions lower refinery outputs a disruption of oil imports or otherwise the company would be negatively impacted 

 

the fra regulates several of the company’s core operations including track and mechanical equipment standards signaling systems inspection of grade crossing warning devices locomotive engineer certifications and employee injury reporting among other areas the company’s unintentional failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in csx in addition a change in these regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations and liquidity 

network congestion caused by unanticipated increases in freight or passenger activity could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency 

 

the company may experience rail network difficulties related to network capacity unplanned increases in demand for rail service increased passenger activities in capacityconstrained areas or regulatory changes impacting when csxt can transport freight or its service routes that could have a negative effect on the company’s operational fluidity leading to deterioration of service asset utilization and overall efficiency in addition the company may face external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences including floods fires hurricanes and earthquakes which may disrupt the company’s operations 

 

csx corporation 

part i 

increases in the number and magnitude of property damage and personal injury claims could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company faces inherent business risk from exposure to property damage occupational injury claims and personal injury claims resulting from train accidents worker injury claims under fela and claims from outside parties resulting from the company’s operations although the company is working diligently to enhance its safety programs and to continue to raise the awareness levels of its employees concerning safety the company could experience material property damage personal injury or occupational claims in the future and it may incur significant costs to defend such claims 

 

existing claims may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in reserve estimates as the ultimate outcome of existing claims is subject to numerous factors outside of the company’s control the company establishes reserves to cover all of these types of claims however final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may differ materially from the recorded reserves 

 

the company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures 

the company is subject to various existing lawsuits and potential unknown litigation the company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend any such lawsuits additionally existing litigation may suffer adverse development not currently reflected in the company’s reserve estimates as the ultimate outcome of existing litigation is subject to numerous factors outside of the company’s control while the company uses its best efforts to evaluate existing litigation the final judgments may differ materially from the recorded reserves 

 

future acts of terrorism war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the company’s operations 

 

    terrorist attacks such as those that occurred in the united states in september 2001 in spain in march 2004 in england in july 2005 and in india in july 2006 along with any government response to those attacks may adversely affect the company’s financial position results of operations and liquidity csxt’s rail lines or other key infrastructure may be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war this could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues in addition insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by the company could increase dramatically or the coverage may no longer be available 

 

furthermore in response to the heightened risk of terrorism federal state and local governmental bodies are proposing and beginning to adopt various legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry for example the dhs proposed regulations that would require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials

most of csxts employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements generally speaking these agreements are bargained nationally by the national carriers committee in the rail industry negotiations have generally taken place over a number of years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages over the last 30 years there were only six days of work stoppage related to labor disputes over national handling if the company is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements it could result in strikes by the affected workers loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members any of which could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations and liquidity under the railway labor act’s procedures which include mediation coolingoff periods and the possibility of presidential intervention neither party may exercise selfhelp until the procedures are exhausted 

the company relies on the stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business 

the company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business a significant disruption or failure of our information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment could result in a service interruption safety failure security breach or other operational difficulties while the company has taken steps to mitigate these risks the performance and reliability of its technology systems are critical to its ability to compete effectively 

the company faces competition from rail carriers and other transportation providers 

the company experiences competition in the form of pricing service reliability and other factors from other transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and to a less significant extent barges ships and pipelines transportation providers such as motor carriers and barges utilize public rightsofway that are built and maintained by governmental entities while csxt and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks using largely internal resources any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks could negatively impact the company’s financial position results of operations and liquidity

rail property 

csxt’s properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure locomotives and freight cars these categories and the geography of the network are described below 

track and infrastructure 

serving 23 states the district of columbia and the canadian provinces of ontario and quebec the csxt rail network serves among other markets new york philadelphia and boston in the northeast and midatlantic the southeast markets of atlanta miami and new orleans and the midwestern cities of st louis memphis and chicago 

csxt’s track structure includes main thoroughfares connecting terminals and yards known as mainline track track within terminals and switching yards track adjacent to the mainlines used for passing trains track connecting the mainline track to customer locations  and track that diverts trains from one track to another known as turnouts total track miles are greater than the company’s approximately 21000 route miles which reflect the size of csx’s rail network that connects markets customers and western railroads at december 2007 the breakdown of track miles was as follows 

 

in addition to its physical track structure csxt operates numerous yards and terminals these serve as the hubs between csxt and its local customers and as sorting facilities where rail cars often are received resorted and placed onto new outbound trains

the following 36 yards are identified as key to the csxt system listed in alphabetical order by state 

 

for a list of intermodal’s terminals see page 16 

network geography 

csxt’s train operations are primarily focused around the following four major transportation networks which are defined geographically or by line of business and are described below 

coal network   –   coal is used to generate more than half of the electricity in the united states the csxt coal network connects mining operations in nine states with industrial areas in the northeast and midatlantic as well as many river lake and seaport facilities this network also supports the strong growing utility market in the southeast 

southeastern corridor – this section of the network runs from the western gateways of chicago memphis and st louis through the growing cities of nashville birmingham and atlanta and into the expanding markets in the southeast csxt’s capacity investment in this corridor clearly strengthens this route and makes it the premier rail route connecting these key cities and gateways with the growing southeast the corridor extends through the coal reserves of the southern illinois basin and provides direct rail service between these coal sources and the increasing demand for coal in the southeast the increase in capacity on this corridor   positions csxt well to handle the projected traffic volumes of intermodal coal automotive and general merchandise traffic 

csx corporation 

part i 

interstate 90 i90 corridor – chicago and metropolitan areas in new york and new england are linked by csxt’s i90 corridor much of this route has two lanes of track sidebyside referred to as double mainline track supporting highspeed intermodal and automotive services the i90 corridor is also a primary route for import traffic moving across the country through chicago and into the population centers in the northeast continued growth in consumption in the east and northeast makes this corridor a critical element in the company’s overall system 

interstate 95 i95 corridor – charleston jacksonville miami and many other cities throughout the growing southeast are connected to the heavily populated northeastern cities of baltimore philadelphia and new york along csxt’s i95 corridor this route is primarily used to ship food and consumer products as well as metals and chemicals it is the only rail corridor along the east coast south of washington dc and provides access to all the major eastern ports 

locomotives 

csxt focuses on maximum use of its fleet and prudent investment in new units to drive the rail network better locomotive management helps csxt move freight more efficiently while continued investment in csxt’s power source means csxt is operating more locomotives better 

csxt operates more than 4000 locomotives of which over 95 are owned by csxt freight locomotives are the power source used primarily to pull rail cars switching locomotives are used in yards to sort railcars so that the right railcar gets attached to the right train in order to get it to its final destination auxiliary units are typically used to provide extra traction for heavy trains in hilly terrain at december 2007 csxt’s owned and longterm leased locomotives consisted of the following 

 

freight car fleet 

the average daily fleet of carsonline consists of approximately 222000 cars but at any point in time over half of the railcars on the csxt system are not owned or leased by csxt examples of these are railcars owned by other railroads which are utilized by csxt shipperfurnished or private cars which are generally used only in that shipper’s service and multilevel railcars 

csx corporation 

part i 

csxt’s freight car fleet consists of six main types of cars 

gondolas – support csxt’s metals markets and provide transport for woodchips and other bulk commodities some gondolas are equipped with special hoods for protecting products like coil and sheet steel 

opentop hoppers – transport heavy dry bulk commodities such as coal coke stone sand ores and gravel that are resistant to weather conditions 

box cars – include a variety of tonnages sizes door configurations and heights to accommodate a wide range of finished products including paper auto parts appliances and building materials insulated box cars deliver food products canned goods beer and wine 

covered hoppers – have a permanent roof and are segregated based upon commodity density lighter bulk commodities such as grain fertilizer flour salt sugar clay and lime are shipped in large cars called jumbo covered hoppers heavier commodities like cement ground limestone and glass sand are shipped in small cube covered hoppers 

multilevel flat cars – transport finished automobiles and are differentiated by the number of levels bilevels for large vehicles such as pickup trucks and suvs and trilevels for sedans and smaller automobiles 

flat cars – used for shipping intermodal containers and trailers or bulk and finished goods such as lumber pipe plywood drywall and pulpwood 

other cars owned or leased on the network include but are not limited to center beam cars for transporting lumber and building products 

    

  csxt owns more than 60 of its freight cars at december 2007 csxt’s owned and longterm leased freight car fleet consisted of the following

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

strategic overview 

the company provides customers access to a modern transportation network that connects ports production and distribution centers to markets in the northeast midwest and the rapidly growing southern states the company transports a diversified portfolio of products from domestically abundant coal to new energy sources such as ethanol from automobiles produced by traditional american manufacturers to “new domestic” factories owned by european japanese and korean companies and from lifeessential chemicals to lifeenriching consumer electronics additionally the company serves every major market in the eastern united states and has direct access to all atlantic and gulf coast ports as well as the mississippi river the great lakes and the st lawrence seaway furthermore the company has access to pacific ports through alliances with western railroads overall the company’s transportation network encompasses approximately 21000 route miles of track in 23 states the district of columbia and the canadian provinces of ontario and quebec 

as the nation consumes increasingly higher quantities of imported goods those products must be transported across the country in a way that minimizes the impact on the environment takes traffic off an already congested highway system and minimizes fuel consumption and transportation costs the company’s transportation network located in the largest and fastestgrowing population centers in the nation is wellpositioned to capitalize on consumption growth trends in this regard more than twothirds of americans live within the company’s service territory accounting for about threequarters of the nation’s consumption 

the company has made substantial strides in operating performance in order to capitalize on these consumption growth trends in 2004 the company implemented the one plan which continues to focus on optimizing the train network and utilizing rail assets more efficiently anchored by the one plan and a variety of other initiatives implemented after the one plan was introduced the company has achieved significant operational improvements that have enhanced safety service reliability and productivity these strong results include the highest customer satisfaction scores ever achieved by the company as measured by independent surveys of its customers 

in addition to the one plan the company recently embarked on a new initiative called total service integration “tsi” which aims to better align the company’s capabilities with customer demands tsi aims to optimize train size and increase asset utilization while delivering more reliable service to customers 

csx corporation 

part ii 

these initiatives delivered strong results for shareholders while higher levels of customer service have led to improved pricing these efforts combined with operational efficiencies have resulted in substantial improvements in csx’s operating income and operating ratio 

in addition to driving better financial results to create value for shareholders csx also employs a balanced approach in deploying its capital for the benefit of shareholders this approach includes investments in the future share repurchases and dividends through this balanced use of financial resources csx will continue to capitalize on an economic environment that is increasingly favoring rail transportation 

2007 csx highlights 

surface transportation 

 

 

 

 

leadership discipline and execution resulted in excellent 2007 results which included the lowest surface transportation operating ratio in a decade revenue and revenue per unit increased 5 and 8 respectively from a year ago reflecting the improving value csx provides its customers through better service the company was able to achieve substantial pricing gains predominantly due to csxt service improvements and the overall cost advantages that the company’s railbased solutions provide to customers versus other modes of transportation 

the strong results in revenue were achieved despite volume declines in all of the company’s four major lines of business the overall 3 volume decrease versus last year was primarily driven by continued weakness in the merchandise market relating to housing construction and associated markets as well as lower automotive production 

expenses were higher due to the effects of rising fuel prices and higher prior year gains on insurance recoveries which were recorded as a reduction to operating expenses lower 2007 volume and better productivity from improved operations partially offset the effects of inflation for certain expense categories 

csx corporation 

part ii 

for additional information refer to rail and intermodal results of operations discussed on pages 40 through 43 

the company’s continued focus on safety and operating plan execution helped all service measurements improve compared to last year within the service measures csx achieved record performance on both of its key safety measures fra personal injuries frequency index and fra train accident rate in 2007 despite some costly train accidents improved safety is the result of the safety leadership and train accident prevention processes both of these use training awareness compliance measurement and root cause analysis to prevent incidents and create a safer work environment 

in addition csx continues to improve its train operations with gains of 4 and 12 in ontime train originations and ontime destination arrivals respectively velocity a measure of overall network fluidity increased 5 in 2007 more important was the consistent weektoweek velocity which indicates more reliable service to customers improved network operations also drove increased asset utilization including an improvement of 8 in dwell which is the average time cars spend in terminals when being switched the table below shows these key measurements and resources 

csx corporation

key performance measures definitions 

fra personal injuries frequency index – number of frareportable injuries per 200000 manhours 

fra train accident rate – number of frareportable train accidents per million trainmiles 

ontime train originations – percent of scheduled road trains that depart the origin yard ontime or ahead of schedule per the one plan 

ontime destination arrivals – percent of scheduled trains that arrive at the destination yard ontime to two hours late 30 minutes for intermodal trains per the one plan 

dwell – measures the time in hours cars spend in each yard does not include cars moving through the yard on the same train 

carsonline – a count of all cars on the csx network including those at customer locations does not include locomotives cabooses trailers containers or maintenance equipment 

system train velocity – average train speed between terminals in miles per hour does not include locals yard jobs work trains or passenger trains 

recrews – number of relief crews called a measure of line of road efficiency in the use of crews

other highlights 

while operating activities generated higher cash free cash flow which includes dividend payments declined 216 million to 145 million during 2007 the decline was primarily due to higher capital expenditures and dividends along with lower insurance recoveries from claims related to hurricane katrina see page 32 for further details on the changes in free cash flow during 2007 

surface transportation capital expenditures which exclude the greenbrier were 17 billion in 2007 this level of investment highlights the company’s commitment to maintain and improve its existing infrastructure and to position itself for longterm growth through expanding network and terminal capacity the increase compared to prior year was largely due to refinancing a portion of its locomotive capacity by replacing 150 leased units with newly owned locomotives 

csx also announced three significant financial events in 2007 first csx increased its quarterly dividend from 010 to 012 during the first quarter of 2007 it then increased the dividend again during the third quarter of 2007 to 015 which represented a 50 increase from the quarterly dividend level at fourth quarter 2006 finally csx announced a total of 3 billion in share repurchase programs during 2007 and has completed about 70 of the repurchases see note 1 nature of operations and significant accounting policies 

expectations 

longterm transportation demand 

  transportation demand is based on increases in population and higher consumption levels which in turn drive the production of goods domestically and abroad that must be transported from factories and ports to the markets where they will be consumed 

  recent census projections estimate that today’s population of 301 million people will grow to more than 330 million by 2020 major metropolitan areas in the southeast where csx has a strong presence are projected to grow at significantly faster rates even in slowergrowing areas over the remainder of the company’s territory consumption levels are projected to increase 

  freight tonnage – domestic and international – is expected to increase nearly 50 by 2020 according to the american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto placing further strain on the transportation system of america and requiring reliable solutions for shippers worldwide 

csx corporation 

part ii 

impact on csx 

  the company is well positioned to meet the nation’s growing transportation demand for example due to factors such as highway congestion new regulations on hours of service and driver shortages in the trucking industry trucking companies are beginning to partner with the company to outsource their longhaul services and reduce their cost of shipping due to the superior cost structure of the railroads for longhaul shipments 

  additionally the need for environmentally sensitive transportation solutions also favors csx because railroads are three times more fuel efficient than highway transportation a single train can carry the load of more than 280 trucks reducing highway congestion and pollution while moving goods more efficiently 

  industry analysts predict that the pricing environment will reflect the increasing importance of railroads in serving america’s growing transportation needs and the cost of the infrastructure investments needed to maintain the safety and security of these networks and to expand them this will drive revenue growth as volumes increase furthermore while the market for transportation services remains competitive tighter capacity and improved service levels through initiatives such as the one plan and tsi are expected to sustain this favorable pricing environment reflecting the overall value that csx provides to its customers 

forecasts 

  the company bases its performance expectations on external forecasts of economic indicators such as gross domestic product industrial production and overall import levels although certain markets will remain weak such as those that are impacted by the housing and automotive sectors the indicators that influence csx’s businesses are expected to be favorable in 2008 considering these and other factors the company believes that its business environment remains strong and will support consistent continuous financial improvements for the next several years 

  considering the company’s solid overall business environment along with momentum in its underlying business performance csx expects that its financial performance in 2008 will be consistent with its longterm financial targets which include compounded annual growth rates “cagr” as shown below 

 

csx corporation 

part ii 

to reinforce its longterm vision the company’s surface transportation capital budget is expected to be nearly 5 billion between 2008 and 2010 these investments come at a time when the return on investment in the railroad industry is improving approximately 60 of the company’s capital is targeted for infrastructure investment to improve network reliability and recoverability and to drive even better performance in safety another 20 of the company’s capital will be invested in its locomotive and freight car fleets the remaining 20 of csx’s capital spending will further expand network terminal capacity improve technology and position the company for longterm growth 

free cash flow 

free cash flow is considered a nongaap financial measure under sec regulation g disclosure of nongaap measures management believes however that free cash flow is important in evaluating the company’s financial performance and measures an ability to generate cash without incurring additional external financing free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than a substitute for cash provided by operating activities 

free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions dividends and certain other investing activities such as insurance proceeds also added to free cash flow is the company’s 42 economic interest in conrail’s free cash flow which is not consolidated in csx amounts other deposits which are included in cash provided by operating activities are not included in the company’s free cash flow because these deposits represent assets that were set aside for specific debt payments

operating revenue 

operating revenue increased 948 million in 2006 to 96 billion compared to 86 billion for the prior year the primary components of the revenue gain were continued yield management and the company’s fuel surcharge program which drove revenue per unit across all major markets 

operating income 

operating income increased 588 million to 21 billion in 2006 which was driven by increased operating revenues these revenue gains and gains on insurance proceeds from hurricane katrina were partially offset by increases in fuel expense caused by higher fuel prices and lower hedge benefits 

other income 

other income decreased 6 million to 95 million in 2006 this change was driven primarily by lower real estate sales which was partially offset by an aftertax noncash gain on additional conrail property value received in connection with the 2004 conrail spinoff transaction

2007 vs 2006 rail results of operations 

rail operating revenue 

rail revenue is categorized by three main lines of business merchandise coal and automotive revenue increased 520 million or 6 to 87 billion in 2007 as compared to prior year csxt was able to achieve continued pricing gains predominantly due to the overall cost and service advantages that the company’s rail based solutions provide to customers versus other modes of transportation these pricing gains more than offset volume weakness in housing construction domestic automobile production and related markets 

merchandise 

chemicals – revenue and revenue per unit improved due to a continued favorable pricing environment overall volume declined slightly driven by reduced chlorine shipments and weakness in propane demand due to a milder winter in 2007 

emerging markets – revenue and revenue per unit grew due to continued yield management efforts volume was down as a result of declines in aggregate shipments such as crushed stone sand and gravel caused by a continued weakness in residential construction 

forest products – revenue and volume declined as shipments of building products and paper slowed due to the decline in residential housing starts and electronic media substitution 

agriculture products – strong domestic demand in feed ingredients and soybean shipments supported growth in volume and revenue ethanol volumes also increased as a result of expanded use in the northeast revenue per unit grew as a result of continued focus on yield management 

metals – revenue and revenue per unit increased due to continued pricing actions lower demand for steel due to weakness in housing construction and domestic automobile production resulted in volume declines 

phosphates and fertilizers – volume was flat as higher domestic demand was offset by a decrease in export shipments favorable mix driven by these volume changes coupled with price increases resulted in significantly improved revenue and revenue per unit 

food and consumer – revenue and volume declines were driven by decreased demand for building products appliances and roofing granules which are used to make shingles 

csx corporation 

part ii 

coal 

favorable pricing positively influenced revenue and revenue per unit overall tonnage was flat even though carloads slightly declined due to the use of higher capacity cars allowing the movement of more tons with fewer cars strength in the export market was offset by weakness in utility shipments as stockpiles remain at record high levels 

automotive 

volume declined due to a reduction in light vehicle production several plant closures and lower vehicle sales driven by the slowing economy and tight credit environment consistent with the overall automotive market volumes continued to shift to foreign brands produced domestically 

other rail revenue 

the change is primarily due to increased shipments by the company’s regional railroads and more transloading activities associated with ethanol shipments 

rail operating expense 

total rail operating expenses for 2007 increased 387 million to 67 billion compared to the prior year the description of what is included in each category as well as significant year over year changes is described below 

labor and fringe   expenses include employee compensation and benefit programs these expenses are primarily affected by inflation headcount wage rates incentives earned healthcare plan costs and pension and other postretirement plan expenses these expenses increased 57 million primarily due to wage and benefit inflation which was partially offset by improved productivity and reduced staffing levels 

materials supplies and other   expenses consist primarily of materials and contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment and for terminal services at intermodal and automotive facilities this category also includes costs related to personal injury claims environmental remediation train accidents utilities nonlocomotive fuel property and sales taxes and professional services overall materials supplies and other expenses increased by 85 million in 2007 primarily due to inflation higher train accident related costs and higher environmental costs these costs were partially offset by 99 million of favorable personal injury reserve adjustments during the year which were based on management’s review of the actuarial analyses performed by an independent actuarial firm this was due to a trend of significant decreases in the number and severity of workrelated injuries for csxt employees since 2003 

csx corporation 

part ii 

depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the cost of a capital asset such as locomotives railcars and track structure over its useful life this expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year this expense increased 30 million primarily due to a larger asset base as a result of higher capital spending partially offset by lower depreciation rates resulting from periodic asset life studies 

fuel   expense includes locomotive diesel fuel this expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel offset by the effects of any hedging activities this expense increased 98 million primarily due to higher fuel prices and prior year hedge benefits that were not repeated during 2007 due to the expiration of the fuel hedge program 

equipment and other rents   primarily   includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies net of rents received by csxt for use of csxt equipment this category of expenses also includes lease expenses primarily for locomotives railcars containers and trailers office and other rentals these expenses decreased 36 million due mainly to lower volume and fewer locomotive leases 

inland transportation   expense included in the rail segment is for amounts paid to csxt from intermodal for shipments on csxt’s network these intercompany charges are eliminated in consolidated results 

gain on insurance recoveries includes gains on insurance recoveries related to hurricane katrina while gains were recognized in both years the 139 million decrease for 2007 was due to higher cash receipts for lost profits and replacement value of property compared to the value of the property that was damaged in 2006 versus 2007

2007 vs 2006 intermodal results of operations 

 

intermodal operating income declined 3 or 8 million versus last year on 4 lower revenue partially offset by volume related cost savings revenue and volume decreases reflect losses of several international customers the slowing of asian imports throughout the year and mix impact related to growth in new shorthaul domestic traffic other revenue declined 22 million from the termination of an agreement relating to the storage of containers as well as lower general business levels revenue per unit declined slightly with yield gains in the international market being offset by mix changes related to the new shorthaul domestic traffic 

despite rising fuel costs intermodal operating expense declined 48 million or 4 driven by lower car hire expense related to volume and improved operational efficiency additionally depreciation decreased based on the results of a periodic review of asset useful lives

2006 vs 2005 rail results of operations 

rail operating revenue 

csxt categorizes rail revenue in three main lines of business merchandise coal and automotive revenue for csxt increased 898 million or 12 to 82 billion in 2006 from a year ago continued yield management and fuel surcharge were the primary drivers of revenue per unit gains 

merchandise 

chemicals – revenue and revenue per unit improved by capitalizing on a continued strong pricing environment overall volume was down slightly because high raw material costs continued to negatively affect the us chemical industry’s competitiveness and in turn csxt volumes 

emerging markets – growth was driven by increased shipments of municipal waste military and aggregate products which include rocks and sand revenue per unit also improved due to strong pricing actions 

forest products – shipment of building products and printing paper slowed due to the decline in residential housing starts and electronic media conversion however revenue and revenue per unit improved due to a favorable pricing environment 

agriculture products – strong domestic demand in feed grain soybean ethanol and export shipments supported volume and revenue per unit in addition strong export demand for grain and increased shipments of beans helped volume growth 

metals – revenue and revenue per unit increased due to continued pricing gains and fuel surcharge coverage volume increased slightly driven by strong steel demand in the energy and nonresidential construction endmarkets these gains were partially offset by lower demand for steel in the automotive sector 

  

phosphates and fertilizers – volume declined from lower export shipments due to increased international phosphate production which caused several domestic phosphate plants to close favorable mix coupled with price increases resulted in significantly improved revenue per unit 

food and consumer – volume growth in alcoholic beverages canned goods and rice and beans was offset by softness in building products perishables and the appliance markets strong pricing actions and a focus on longer more profitable shipments increased revenue and revenue per unit

coal 

revenue and volume improvements were due to increased shipments of utility and export coal utility companies built up their inventories which was a major contributor to csx’s volume growth revenue per unit increased due to the continued favorable pricing environment and increased fuel surcharge coverage 

automotive 

volume declined due to a reduction in north american light vehicle production consistent with the overall automotive market csxt’s volumes continued to shift from the big 3 to foreign brands produced domestically revenue per unit was favorable due to price increases and fuel surcharge 

rail operating expense 

total rail operating expenses for 2006 increased 341 million or 6 to 63 billion compared to the prior year the description of what is included in each category as well as significant year over year changes is described below 

labor and fringe   increased 63 million primarily due to wage and benefit inflation and increased staffing in rail operations 

materials supplies and other   expenses increased by 113 million in 2006 primarily due to materials inflation along with prior year casualty favorable adjustments and supplier reimbursements that were not repeated these costs were partially offset by productivity gains from improved operations such as efficient use of locomotives 

depreciation expense increased 39 million due to a larger asset base related to higher capital spending 

fuel   expense increased 329 million primarily due to reduced hedge benefit from the expiration of the fuel hedge program as well as higher fuel prices 

equipment and other rents   expense decreased 18 million due mainly to improvement in operational fluidity which drove improvements in asset utilization 

gain on insurance recoveries was 166 million for 2006 which represented cash received for lost profits and higher replacement value of property compared to the value of the property that was damaged after consideration of the company’s insurance deductible expensed in 2005

part ii 

2006 vs 2005 intermodal results of operations 

 

intermodal operating income increased 8 or 20 million versus last year driven by revenue gains of 50 million along with expense containment the increase in revenue and revenue per unit was driven by the continued yield management emphasis which was partially offset by mix of traffic volume increased slightly due to continued growth of imported consumer goods from asia as well as the strength in the truckload market offset by weaker demand in services sold to transportation brokers known as wholesale markets 

intermodal operating expense increased 30 million primarily driven by an increase in fuel costs that are reflected in inland transportation expense fuel costs were higher due to rising market prices partially offsetting the increase in fuel were efficiency gains related to equipment utilization

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned operational growth in order to have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity its balance sheet sources and uses of cash flow and external factors should be reviewed 

material changes in the consolidated balance sheets 

csx’s balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of csx’s balanced approach in deploying its capital for the benefit of its shareholders which includes reinvestment in the company’s existing infrastructure investments in the future share repurchases and dividends 

longterm debt increased 11 billion to 65 billion due to debt issuances in 2007 of 24 billion partially offset by the conversion of a portion of convertible debt into csx common stock and the reclassification of debt from longterm to current see the schedule of contractual obligations and commercial commitments on page 50 and note 9 debt and credit agreements for additional details 

other capital decreased 14 billion to 37 million as a result of significant share repurchase activity partially offset by stock option exercises and the conversion of a portion of convertible debt into csx common stock for additional information on the company’s share repurchase activity see note 1 nature of operations and significant accounting policies 

sources and uses of cash 

csx has multiple sources of cash first the company generates cash from operations in 2007 csx generated 22 billion of cash from operating activities which represented a 126 million increase from the prior year second csx has numerous financing sources including access to the capital markets and a 125 billion fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in may 2012 this facility can be increased by an additional 500 million to 175 billion with the approval of the lending banks see note 9 debt and credit agreements for more information 

csx also has an effective shelf registration statement on file with the sec that is unlimited as to amount and may be used subject to market conditions and csx board authorization to issue debt or equity securities at csx’s discretion while csx seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit csx to sell such debt securities on acceptable terms at any given time or at all 

csx corporation 

part ii 

among other things csx uses cash for significant annual reinvestment in infrastructure and equipment share repurchases and scheduled payments of debt and leases with manageable nearterm maturities the company’s cash requirements also include dividends to shareholders 

during 2007 net cash used by investing activities was 17 billion this use of funds was predominately driven by property additions and capital expansion projects made by the company net cash used in financing activities was 584 million due to over 2 billion of cash used for share repurchases during 2007 largely offset by a net increase in longterm debt issued versus longterm debt repaid 

dividend payments are another use of cash the company paid dividends of 231 million in 2007 which was 86 million more than prior year the increase in 2007 was primarily due to the company increasing quarterly dividends to 015 per share 

working capital 

working capital can be considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its shortterm needs csx had a working capital deficit at december 2007 of 180 million compared to a surplus of 150 million last year driven by lower cash and higher current debt balances in 2007 the larger current debt balance includes a reclassification of outstanding convertible debt with a face value of 174 million from longterm to current during 2007 this reflects bondholders’ rights under the convertible debt to require csx to purchase the debentures in october 2008 in lieu of the later maturity date 

a working capital deficit is not unusual for csx or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity the company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due csx has sufficient financial capacity including the revolving line of credit and shelf registration to manage its daytoday cash requirements and any anticipated obligations 

credit ratings 

credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies standard  poor’s “sp” and moody’s investors service “moody’s” use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa1 for sp and moody’s respectively 

csx corporation 

part ii 

longterm ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sp and moody’s respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be “investment grade” currently the longterm ratings for csx’s obligations along with the other large us class 1 freight railroads fall within the investment grade band of credit quality 

in 2007 sp and moody’s both lowered their ratings of csxs longterm unsecured debt obligations from bbb and baa2 respectively to bbb and baa3 respectively this was due to the company’s announcement in second quarter 2007 of a plan to repurchase an additional 1 billion of csx stock in addition to the 2 billion repurchase plan announced earlier in 2007 both of these agencies indicate their outlook is “stable” and these ratings continue to be investment grade csx maintained these credit ratings through december 2007 and does not expect that this reduction in credit ratings will materially increase its borrowing costs or materially affect its liquidity if csxs credit ratings were to decline to lower levels the company could experience more significant increases in its interest cost for new debt in addition the market’s demand and thus the company’s ability to readily issue new debt could become further influenced by the economic and credit market environment

offbalance sheet arrangements 

for detailed information about the company’s guarantees operating leases and purchase obligations see note 7 commitments and contingencies 

there are no offbalance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

critica l accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results may differ from those estimates these estimates and assumptions are discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors on a regular basis consistent with the prior year significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas 

 

 

 

 

casualty environmental and legal reserves 

casualty 

casualty reserves represent accruals for personal injury and occupational injury claims currently no individual claim is expected to exceed the company’s selfinsured retention amount to the extent the value of an individual claim exceeds the selfinsured retention amount csx would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries personal injury and occupational claims are presented on a gross basis and in accordance with sfas 5 accounting for contingencies “sfas 5” these reserves fluctuate with estimates provided by independent third parties reviewed by management and are offset by the timing of payments most of the claims were related to csxt unless otherwise noted 

csx corporation 

part ii 

defense and processing costs which historically have been insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future are not included in the recorded liabilities the company is presently selfinsured for personal injury and occupationalrelated claims 

personal injury 

personal injury reserves represent liabilities for employee workrelated and thirdparty injuries workrelated injuries for csxt employees are primarily subject to the federal employers’ liability act “fela” in addition to fela liabilities employees of other csx subsidiaries are covered by various state workers’ compensation laws the federal longshore and harbor worker’s compensation program or the maritime jones act 

csxt retains an independent actuarial firm to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims and cases an analysis is performed by the independent actuarial firm semiannually and is reviewed by management the methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims it is based largely on csxt’s historical claims and settlement experience actual results may vary from estimates due to the type and severity of the injury costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation 

based on management’s review of the actuarial analyses performed by an independent actuarial firm the company reduced personal injury reserves by 99 million during 2007 this reduction is due to a trend of significant decreases in the number and severity of workrelated injuries for csxt employees since 2003 the analyses further indicated an absence of large catastrophic claims since 2003 which also was determined to be a trend these reductions were included in materials supplies and other in the consolidated income statements 

occupational 

occupational claims arise from allegations of exposures to certain materials in the workplace such as asbestos solvents which include soaps and chemicals and diesel fuels or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions such as repetitive stress injuries carpal tunnel syndrome and hearing loss 

asbestos 

the company is party to a number of occupational claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the workplace the heaviest possible exposure for employees was due to work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines that were largely phased out beginning around the 1950s however other types of exposures including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials continued until it was substantially eliminated by 1985 additionally the company has retained liability for asbestos claims filed against the previously owned international container shipping business 

csx corporation 

part ii 

the company retains a third party specialist with extensive experience in performing asbestos and other occupational studies to assist management in assessing the value of the company’s claims and cases the analysis is performed by the specialist semiannually and is reviewed by management the objective of the analysis is to determine the number of estimated incurred but not reported “ibnr” claims and the estimated average cost per claim to be received over the next seven years seven years was determined by management to be the time period in which probable claim filings and claim values could be estimated with more certainty 

the company with the assistance of the third party specialist determines its potentially exposed population and it is then able to derive the estimated number of ibnr claims the estimated average cost per claim is then determined utilizing recent actual average cost per claim data and national industry data key elements of the assessment include the following 

 

 

 

 

csx corporation 

part ii 

 

 

from these assumptions the company projects the incidence of each type of disease to the estimated population to determine the total estimated number of employees that could potentially assert a claim historical claim filing rates are applied for each type of disease to the total number of employees that could potentially assert a claim to determine the total number of anticipated claim filings by disease type historical dismissal rates which represented claims that were closed without payment were deducted to calculate the number of future claims by disease type that would likely require payment by the company finally the number of such claims was multiplied by the average settlement value to estimate the company’s future liability for ibnr asbestos claims 

the estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for this reserve a 1 increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of ibnr claims or the average claim values would result in an approximate 1 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted asbestos claims 

other occupational 

the company retains a third party specialist with extensive experience in performing other occupational studies to assist management in assessing the value of the company’s claims and cases the analysis is performed by the specialist semiannually and is reviewed by management similar to the asbestos liability estimation process the key elements of the assessment include the following 

 

 

csx corporation 

part ii 

 

 

the estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for this reserve a 1 increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of ibnr claims or the average claim values would not result in a material increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted other occupational claims 

environmental 

the company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party “prp” at approximately 247 environmentally impaired sites many of which were or may be subject to remedial action under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 or cercla also known as the superfund law or similar state statutes most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations however a number of these proceedings are based on allegations that the company or its predecessors sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment or disposal in addition some of the company’s land holdings were leased to others for commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the company 

in any such proceedings the company is subject to environmental cleanup and enforcement actions under the superfund law as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct these costs could be substantial 

in accordance with statement of position 961 environmental remediation liabilities  the company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least once a quarter giving consideration to a number of factors such as 

 

 

csx corporation 

part ii 

 

 

based on the review process the company has recorded amounts to cover contingent future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are estimable and probable the recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted and include amounts representing the companys estimate of unasserted claims which the company believes to be immaterial the liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated insurance recoveries 

currently the company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities if any on some sites until completion of future environmental studies in addition conditions that are currently unknown could at any given location result in exposure the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reliably estimated based upon information currently available however the company believes its environmental reserves are adequate to fund remedial actions to comply with present laws and regulations and that the ultimate liability for these matters if any will not materially affect its overall results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

legal 

in accordance with sfas 5 an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated if no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred 

the company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above the amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings newly discovered or developed evidence or changes in laws regulations and evidentiary standards 

csx corporation 

part ii 

pension and postretirement medical plan accounting 

the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried management personnel the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement for employees hired after december 31 2002 benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age service and compensation csx made pension plan contributions of 266 million to its qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2007 

in addition to these plans csx sponsors a postretirement medical plan and one life insurance plan that provide benefits to fulltime salaried management employees hired prior to january 1 2003 upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met the postretirement medical plan is contributory partially funded by retirees with retiree contributions adjusted annually the life insurance plan is noncontributory 

the accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in sfas 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132 r “ sfas 158 ” sfas 87 employers accounting for pensions “sfas 87” and sfas 106 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pension “sfas 106” 

sfas 87 requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

these assumptions are determined as of the beginning of the year as permitted by sfas 87 the company has elected to use a plan measurement date of september 30 to actuarially value its pension and postretirement plans as required by sfas 158 csx will change its measurement date to the fiscal year end in 2008 and does not expect the impact to be material the company engages independent external actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the company selects the company reviews the longterm rate of return discount salary scale inflation and health care cost trend rates on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends as appropriate 

csx corporation 

part ii 

 

longterm rate of return on plan assets 

the expected longterm average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation in estimating that rate the company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment 

the companys expected longterm average rate of return on assets considers the current and projected asset mix of the funds management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected longterm rate of return on assets as this assumption is longterm it is adjusted less frequently than other assumptions used in pension accounting the longterm rate of return on plan assets used by the company to value its 2007 pension obligation was 85 

discount rates 

discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component of pension and postretirement expense discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other postretirement benefits could be effectively settled or in other words how much it would cost the company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the company’s expected future benefit payments the company determines the discount rate based on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows matching the plans’ expected benefit payments 

the discount rates used by the company to value its 2007 pension and postretirement obligations are 6 and 575 respectively the company uses a different discount rate for pension and postretirement benefits due to the different time horizons of future payments for each of the plans for pensions the time horizon is approximately 12 years while for postretirement the time horizon is approximately 8 years 

each year these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates if interest rates generally decline or rise the assumed discount rates will change 

  salary scale inflation rates 

salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the company the company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates the company used a salary scale rate of 41 to value its 2007 pension obligation 

csx corporation 

part ii 

health care cost trend rates 

health care cost trend rates are based on recent plan experience and industry trends the company uses actuarial data to substantiate the inflation assumption for health care costs representing increases in total plan costs which include claims and administrative fee cost components the current assumed health care cost trend rate is 10 for medicareeligible participants and 9 for nonmedicareeligible participants and is expected to decrease gradually until reaching 475 in 2014 based upon current actuarial projections 

other assumptions 

  the calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to mortality rates turnover and retirement age these assumptions are based upon historical data and are approved by management 

2007 estimated pension and postretirement expense 

net periodic pension and postretirement benefits expense for 2008 is expected to be approximately 34 million and 28 million respectively compared to 64 million and 25 million respectively in 2007 

the following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effect of changes in certain assumptions like discount rates salaries and health care costs on the 2008 estimated pension and postretirement expense 

 

depreciation policies for assets under the grouplife method 

csxt accounts for its rail assets including mainline track locomotives and freight cars using the grouplife method the grouplife method pools similar assets by type and then depreciates each group as a whole under the grouplife method the service lives for each group of rail assets are determined by completing periodic life studies and applying managements assumptions concerning the service lives of its properties these life studies are conducted by a third party expert analyzed by the companys management and approved by the stb life studies for equipment assets are required every three years whereas road and track life studies are required every six years by the stb 

csx corporation 

part ii 

changes in asset lives due to the results of the life studies could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense and thus the companys results of operations factors taken into account during the life study include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the life studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the appropriate amount indicated by the study any such deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining useful life of the asset group until the next required life study 

in 2007 csxt completed life studies for all of its equipment road and track assets and also completed an analysis of the assets received in the conrail reorganization which resulted in a reduction in depreciation expense for equipment and road assets and an increase in depreciation expense for track assets the combination of these adjustments reduced depreciation expense by 21 million in 2007 also in 2007 the company reviewed the useful lives of intermodal terminal assets as well as lift equipment and containers a 4 million reduction in depreciation expense was recognized as a result of this periodic review 

assets depreciated under the grouplife method comprise 91 of csxts total fixed assets of 21 billion on a net basis at december 28 2007 the company’s depreciation expense for the year ended december 28 2007 amounted to 883 million a one percent change in the average life of all grouplife assets would result in an 8 million change to the company’s annual depreciation expense

income taxes 

in 2006 the financial accounting standards board issued fin 48 which became effective for csx beginning in 2007 fin 48 addressed the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under fin 48 the company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution the company’s reassessment of its tax positions in accordance with fin 48 did not have a material impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

csx files a consolidated federal income tax return which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries examinations of the federal income tax returns of csx have been completed through 2003 federal income tax returns for 2004 through 2007 currently are under examination management believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed while the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty it is the opinion of csx management that none of these items will have a materially adverse effect on the results of operations financial condition and liquidity of csx an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items however could have a materially adverse effect on the results of operations financial condition and liquidity in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year also the company is party to a number of legal and administrative proceedings the resolution of which could result in gain realization in amounts that could be material to results of operations financial condition and liquidity in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year 

new accounting pronouncements and change in accounting policy 

see note 1 nature of operations and significant accounting policies under the caption “new accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting policy” 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

csx does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes historically the company has used derivative financial instruments to address market risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and the risk of volatility in its fuel costs but as of december 2007 the company did not have a significant position in derivative financial instruments 

at december 2007 csx had 106 million of outstanding floating rate debt obligations outstanding a 1 fluctuation in interest rates on these notes would cause a 1 million change in interest expense

in the opinion of management the accompanying consolidated financial statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary to fairly present the financial position of csx and its subsidiaries at december 2007 and december 2006 and the consolidated statements of income cash flows and changes in shareholders’ equity for fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 certain prioryear data have been reclassified to conform to the 2007 presentation 

fiscal year 

csx follows a 5253 week fiscal reporting calendar this fiscal calendar allows every quarter to consistently end on a friday and to be of equal duration 13 weeks however to maintain this type of reporting calendar every sixth or seventh year depending on the gregorian calendar and when leap year falls an extra week will be included in one quarter a 14week fiscal quarter and therefore the full fiscal year will have 53 weeks 

fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 each consisted of 52 weeks ending on december 28 2007 december 29 2006 and december 30 2005 respectively except as otherwise specified references to full year indicate csx’s fiscal periods ended on these dates 

principles of consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements include results of operations of csx and its majorityowned subsidiaries all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated most investments in companies that were not majorityowned were carried at cost if less than 20 owned and the company has no significant influence or equity if the company has significant influence 

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

on a daily basis cash in excess of current operating requirements is invested in various highly liquid investments having a typical maturity date of three months or less at the date of acquisition these investments were carried at cost which approximated market value and were classified as cash equivalents investments in instruments with maturities greater than three months but less than one year were classified as shortterm investments

note 1 nature of operations and significant accounting policies continued 

csx holds 270 million and 391 million of auction rate securities and classifies these investments as available for sale as of december 2007 and 2006 respectively accordingly these investments were included in current assets as shortterm investments on the consolidated balance sheets on the consolidated cash flow statements purchases and sales of these assets were classified within investing activities 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for the estimated probable losses on uncollectible accounts and other receivables the allowance is based upon the credit worthiness of customers historical experience the age of the receivable and current market and economic conditions as well as any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectibility uncollectible amounts were charged against the allowance account the allowance for doubtful accounts is netted against accounts receivable 

materials and supplies 

materials and supplies in the consolidated balance sheets were carried at average costs and consist primarily of fuel and parts used in the repair and maintenance of csxt’s freight car and locomotive fleets equipment and track structure 

properties 

all properties were stated at historical cost less an allowance for accumulated depreciation rail assets including mainline track locomotives and freight cars were depreciated using the grouplife method under this method csxt pools similar assets by road and equipment type and then depreciates each group as a whole regulations enforced by the surface transportation board “stb” of the us department of transportation require periodic formal studies of ultimate service lives “life studies” for all railroad assets factors taken into account during a life study include

the results of the life study process determine the service lives for each asset group under the grouplife method these studies are conducted by a third party expert and are analyzed by the companys management resulting changes in service life estimates are subject to review and approval by the stb road assets including mainline track have estimated service lives ranging from six years for system roadway machinery to 80 years for grading equipment assets including locomotives and freight cars have estimated service lives ranging from six years for motor vehicles to 35 years for work equipment 

changes in asset lives due to the results of the life studies are applied at the completion of the life study and continue until the next required life study the life studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by the study any such deficiency or excess amount is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining useful life of the asset group until the next required life study 

the majority of nonrail property is depreciated using the straightline method on a per asset basis the depreciable lives of nonrail property is periodically reviewed by the company and any changes are applied on a prospective basis amortization expense recorded under capital leases is included in depreciation expense on the consolidated income statements 

for retirements or disposals of depreciable rail assets that occur in the ordinary course of business the asset cost net of salvage value or sales proceeds is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized for retirements or disposals of nonrail depreciable assets infrequent disposal of rail assets outside the normal course of business and all dispositions of land the resulting gains or losses are recognized at the time of disposal expenditures that significantly increase asset values or extend useful lives are capitalized repair and maintenance expenditures are charged to operating expense when the work is performed 

 

properties and other longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or business conditions indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable initial assessments of recoverability are based on estimates of undiscounted future net cash flows associated with an asset or a group of assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets  where impairment is indicated the assets are evaluated and their carrying amount is reduced to fair value based on undiscounted net cash flows or other estimates of fair value 

 

revenue and expense recognition 

the company recognizes freight revenue using freeonboard “fob” origin pursuant to emerging issues task force “eitf” 919 revenue and expense recognition for freight services in process  the company uses method 5 in the eitf which provides for the allocation of revenue between reporting periods based on relative transit time in each reporting period expenses are recognized as incurred

new accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting policy 

csx adopted fasb interpretation 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes “fin 48” at the beginning of fiscal year 2007 fin 48 addressed the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on an income tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under fin 48 the company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position these tax benefits recognized in the financial statements are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution the impact of the company’s reassessment of its tax positions in accordance with fin 48 did not have a material impact on the results of operations financial condition and liquidity see note 13 income taxes 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132 r “sfas 158” which changed the accounting rules for reporting and disclosures related to pensions and other postretirement benefit plans companies were required to reflect the funded status of retirement and other postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet this change was effective for the company for fiscal year end 2006 the decrease in equity did not have any significant impact on the company’s credit ratios or financing covenants pursuant to sfas 158 the company will be required to change its september measurement date for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans’ assets and obligations to its fiscal year end effective in 2008 

effective fiscal year 2006 the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123r sharebased payment “sfas 123r” using the modifiedprospectivetransition method under this method compensation costs recognized in 2006 and forward include all unvested sharebased payments as of the beginning of 2006 sharebased compensation at csx may include stock options restricted stock awards stock issued to csx directors and csx’s longterm incentive plans the amount of compensation costs recognized is based upon the estimated grant date fair value method under the blackscholesmerton formula and resulted in the recognition of additional compensation cost from the unvested portion of stock options granted prior to 2003 

the adoption of sfas 123r did not result in a material impact to the company’s consolidated income statement or earnings per share the company recorded 3 million in 2006 of additional compensation expense for unvested stock options granted prior to 2003 compensation costs for all other types of sharebased payments were consistently reported for all periods presented 

csx corporation

item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

note 1 nature of operations and significant accounting policies continued 

in 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 157 fair value measurements “sfas 157” and the statement of financial accounting standards no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities “sfas 159” these statements define fair value provide guidance on fair value measurement and give companies the option to report financial instruments and certain other items at fair value csx does not expect to be materially impacted by these statements 

in 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 51   “ s fas 160” this statement clarifies that minority interest should be reported as equity on the balance sheet additionally it requires disclosure of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest on the face of the income statement for csx sfas 160 is effective beginning fiscal year 2009 and the company does not expect to be materially impacted by this statement 

use of estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results may differ from those estimates critical accounting estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas 

 

 

 

 

other items – share repurchases 

currently csx has purchased 21 billion of its outstanding common stock which represents 50 million shares or about 70 of the 3 billion share repurchase program that was authorized in 2007 csx intends to complete this repurchase program during 2008 the timing method amount of repurchase transactions and the sources of funds to affect any repurchases will be determined by the companys management based on their evaluation of market conditions share price and other factors while it is not management’s intention the program could be suspended or discontinued at any time

note 2 earnings per share continued 

basic earnings per share was based on the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding earnings per share assuming dilution was based on the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding adjusted for the effect of the following types of potentially dilutive common shares 

 

 

 

eitf 048 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share  required csx to include additional shares in the computation of earnings per share assuming dilution the amount included in diluted earnings per share represents the number of shares that would be issued if all of csx’s convertible debentures were converted into csx common stock 

when convertible debentures are converted into csx common stock the newlyissued shares are included in the calculation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on a weighted average basis during 2007 375 million of face value convertible debentures were converted into 13 million shares of csx common stock no material conversions occurred during 2006 at december 2007 174 million face value remained outstanding convertible into 6 million shares 

in 2005 44 million stock options with an average exercise price of 2655 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share assuming dilution since their related option exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares during the period in 2006 and 2007 no stock options were excluded from the calculation as all stock options were dilutive at that time

as of december 2007 there were 2393 current or former employees with stock option grants outstanding under the various plans most new stock awards were granted under the authorization provided in the csx omnibus incentive plan as of december 2007 an additional 12 million shares of stock could be issued under this plan 

sfas 123r requires the cash flows resulting from income tax deductions in excess of compensation costs to be classified as financing cash flows this requirement resulted in reduced net operating cash flows and increased net financing cash flows of approximately 60 million and 59 million for fiscal years 2007 and 2006 respectively prior to the adoption of sfas 123r csx presented all income tax benefits from deductions resulting from compensation costs as operating cash flows in the consolidated cash flow statements

longterm incentive plans 

the csx longterm incentive plans were adopted under the csx omnibus incentive plan the objective of these longterm incentive plans is to motivate and reward key members of management and executives for achieving and exceeding certain strategic initiatives 

in 2007 performance units were granted to certain layers of management under a new longterm incentive plan adopted under the csx omnibus incentive plan this plan provides for a threeyear cycle ending in fiscal year 2009 the key financial target is surface transportation operating ratio which is defined as annual operating expenses divided by revenue of the company’s rail and intermodal businesses and is calculated excluding certain nonrecurring items grants were made in performance units and are payable in csx common stock the payout range for the majority of participants will be between 0 and 200 of the original grant with each unit being equivalent to one share of csx stock the payout for certain senior executive officers is subject to a 20 increase or decrease based upon certain additional preestablished financial targets this could result in a maximum payout of 240 of the original grant however any payout to certain senior executive officers is also subject to a reduction of up to 30 at the discretion of the compensation committee of the board of directors based upon company performance against certain csx strategic initiatives units in the plan have a weighted average grant date fair value of 4333 which includes the value of both the initial grant and subsequent smaller grants issued at different prices based on grant date fair value to new or promoted employees not previously included 

in 2006 grants under two longterm incentive plans were made in the form of performance units one of the plans provided for a twoyear cycle ending in fiscal year 2007 and the other plan provided for a threeyear cycle ending in fiscal year 2008 the terms for these plans are substantially similar to the 2007 plan units in the plans have a weighted average grant date fair value of 3686 which includes the value of both the initial grant and subsequent smaller grants at different prices to new or promoted employees not previously included one of the 2006 plans ended on december 28 2007 and csx issued 14 million net shares in 2008 as a result of the achievement of performance targets for the two preceding fiscal years which had a net market value of 58 million

note 5 hurricane katrina 

in august 2005 hurricane katrina caused extensive damage to company assets on the gulf coast including damage to track infrastructure and bridges operations were returned to prehurricane conditions by the end of the first quarter of 2006 

 

in order to determine the proper accounting treatment for the damage the company reviewed eitf 0110 accounting for the impact of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001  specifically issue 3 of that consensus in which the task force concluded that insurance recoveries in connection with property and casualty losses should be recognized when realization of the claim for recovery of a loss recognized in the financial statements is deemed probable information regarding the company’s insurance coverage at that time damage estimates and the allocation of the insurance deductible is as follows 

insurance coverage 

in 2005 the company had insurance coverage of 535 million after a 25 million deductible per occurrence for the following types of losses 

 

 

 

the company’s insurance policies do not prioritize coverage based on types of losses as claims were submitted to the insurance companies they were reviewed and preliminary payments were received until all losses were incurred and documented a final payment will be received once the company and its insurers agree on the total value of the claim 

csx corporation 

part ii 

item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

 

damage estimates 

management’s current loss estimate is approximately 450 million damages are categorized as follows 

 

 

 

allocation of deductible 

the company’s insurance policies required its participation in the first 25 million of each loss event without regard to the category of the covered losses because the company’s insurance policies do not specifically apply the deductible by the types of losses covered csx believes it is inconsistent with the form and economic substance of the company’s policies to attribute the entire deductible to a single component of covered losses therefore the company allocated the 25 million selfinsured deductible among the above three categories of losses in proportion to the best estimate of the total ultimate losses eligible for recovery under the company’s insurance policies

note 5 hurricane katrina continued 

gain on insurance recoveries 

as of december 2007 the company has collected 367 million of insurance proceeds and recognized 195 million of pretax gains for claims related to hurricane katrina the gains were attributable to recovering amounts in excess of the net book value of damaged fixed assets and to recording recoveries related to lost profits additional cash proceeds are expected and will result in future gain recognition 

details of how the gain was calculated are as follows 

 

gain contingencies subject to fin 30 accounting for involuntary conversions of nonmonetary assets to monetary assets and sfas 5 accounting for contingencies “sfas 5” were not recognized until the period in which all contingencies were resolved or cash proceeds were received the insurance recovery for the replacement cost of property damage in excess of book value and the recovery of lost profits were considered to be gain contingencies therefore the net gain after applying the insurance deductible was deferred until the cash proceeds arewere received 

in measuring the losses incurred in 2005 attributed to hurricane katrina the company considered the actual losses reflected in the financial statements and the allocable deductible based on expected total recoveries from insured losses and recorded a receivable for the difference based on probable insurance recoveries at december 30 2005 no receivables were recorded at the end of fiscal year 2007 or 2006 because cash proceeds exceeded the net book value of fixed asset damage and incremental expenses that were paid

note 5 hurricane katrina continued 

cash flows 

cash proceeds from the insurers are not specific to the types of losses and so for cash flow presentation the company allocated the proceeds ratably among the three types of losses mentioned above allocated cash proceeds for lost profits and incremental expenses were classified as operating activities since they related directly to revenue and expenses from operations and were 13 million 121 million and 29 million for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively allocated cash proceeds for fixed asset damage were classified as investing activities since these proceeds had a direct relationship to money the company spent on property additions to repair the hurricanedamaged assets that were recorded in the same category cash proceeds for fixed asset damage were 16 million 147 million and 41 million for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively

note 6 casualty environmental and other reserves continued 

casualty environmental and other reserves were determined to be critical accounting estimates due to the need for significant management judgments they are provided for in the consolidated balance sheets as follows 

 

details with respect to each type of reserve are described below actual settlements and claims received could differ the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty considering the legal defenses available the liabilities that have been recorded and other factors it is the opinion of management that none of these items when finally resolved will have a material effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity however should a number of these items occur in the same period they could have a material effect on the results of operations financial condition and liquidity in a particular quarter or fiscal year 

casualty 

casualty reserves represent accruals for personal injury and occupational injury claims currently no individual claim is expected to exceed the company’s selfinsured retention amount of 25 million to the extent the value of an individual claim exceeds the selfinsured retention amount csx would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries personal injury and occupational claims are presented on a gross basis and in accordance with sfas 5 these reserves fluctuate with independent third party estimates which are reviewed by management and the timing of payments most of the claims were related to csxt unless otherwise noted 

defense and processing costs which historically have been insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future are not included in the recorded liabilities the company is presently selfinsured for personal injury and occupationalrelated claims

note 6 casualty environmental and other reserves continued 

personal injury 

personal injury reserves represent liabilities for employee workrelated and thirdparty injuries workrelated injuries for csxt employees are primarily subject to the federal employers’ liability act “fela” in addition to fela liabilities employees of other csx subsidiaries are covered by various state workers’ compensation laws the federal longshore and harbor workers’ compensation program or the maritime jones act 

csxt retains an independent actuarial firm to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims and cases an analysis is performed by the independent actuarial firm semiannually and is reviewed by management the methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims it is based largely on csxt’s historical claims and settlement experience actual results may vary from estimates due to the type and severity of the injury costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation reserves for personal injury claims were 338 million and 424 million at december 2007 and december 2006 respectively 

during 2007 the company reduced personal injury reserves by 99 million based on management’s review of the actuarial analyses performed by an independent actuarial firm this reduction is due to a trend of significant decreases in the number and severity of workrelated injuries for csxt employees since 2003 the analyses further indicated a reduction of large catastrophic claims since 2003 which also was determined to be a trend these reductions were included in materials supplies and other in the consolidated income statements 

occupational 

occupational claims arise from allegations of exposures to certain materials in the workplace such as asbestos solvents which include soaps and chemicals and diesel fuels or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions such as repetitive stress injuries carpal tunnel syndrome and hearing loss 

reserves for asbestos related claims were 129 million and 121 million at december 2007 and december 2006 respectively reserves for all other occupational claims were 79 million and 92 million at december 2007 and december 2006 respectively

asbestos 

the company is party to a number of occupational claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the workplace the heaviest possible exposure for employees was due to work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines that were largely phased out beginning around the 1950s however other types of exposures including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials continued until it was substantially eliminated by 1985 additionally the company has retained liability for asbestos claims filed against its previously owned international container shipping business 

the company retains a third party specialist with extensive experience in performing asbestos and other occupational studies to assist management in assessing the value of the company’s claims and cases the analysis is performed by the specialist semiannually and is reviewed by management the objective of the analysis is to determine the number of estimated incurred but not reported “ibnr” claims and the estimated average cost per claim to be received over the next seven years seven years was determined by management to be the time period in which probable claim filings and claim values could be estimated with more certainty 

the company with the assistance of the third party specialist determines its potentially exposed population and is then able to calculate the estimated number of ibnr claims the estimated average cost per claim is then determined utilizing recent actual average cost per claim data and national industry data key elements of the assessment include the following 

 

 

csx corporation

note 6 casualty environmental and other reserves continued 

 

 

 

from these assumptions the company projects the incidence of each type of disease to the estimated population to determine the total estimated number of employees that could potentially assert a claim historical claim filing rates were applied for each type of disease to the total number of employees that could potentially assert a claim to determine the total number of anticipated claim filings by disease type historical dismissal rates which represented claims that were closed without payment were deducted to calculate the number of future claims by disease type that would likely require payment by the company finally the number of such claims was multiplied by the average settlement value to estimate the company’s future liability for ibnr asbestos claims 

the estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values were the most sensitive assumptions for this reserve a 1 increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of ibnr claims or the average claim values would result in an approximate 1 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted asbestos claims 

undiscounted liabilities recorded related to asbestos claims were as follows

note 6 casualty environmental and other reserves continued 

 

in 2005 management updated its estimate of the ibnr liability exposure with the assistance of the third party specialists which resulted in recognition of a 48 million favorable change associated with asbestos liabilities a net 38 million favorable change for all occupational liabilities during 2004 and 2005 asbestos related disease claims filed against the company dropped substantially particularly bulk claims filed by certain law firms in 2003 the company received a significant number of filings the company believes the high 2003 number was attributable to an attempt to file before a new more restrictive venue law took effect in west virginia in mid2003 as a result management reassessed the calibration period from a fouryear average to a threeyear average in 2005 excluding the surge in claims originating in west virginia management believes this calibration period represents the best estimate of future filing rates there have been no changes to the number of years used in the calibration period since 2005 

other occupational 

the company retains a third party specialist with extensive experience in performing other occupational studies to assist management in assessing the value of the company’s claims and cases the analysis is performed by the specialist semiannually and is reviewed by management similar to the asbestos liability estimation process the key elements of the assessment include the following

approximately 6000 of the open claims at december 2007 were asbestos claims against csx’s previously owned international container shipping business because these claims were against multiple vessel owners the company’s reserves reflect its portion of those claims the company had approximately 9 million reserved for these shipping business claims at december 2007 and 2006 the remaining open claims were asserted against csxt 

separation

for every 1 change in the assumed health care cost trend rate service and interest cost will change 1 million consolidated income statement impact for every 1 increase in the health care cost trend rate the company’s benefit obligation will increase by 15 million and for every 1 decrease the company’s benefit obligation will decrease by 13 million consolidated balance sheet impact an increase in rates has a greater effect on the company’s benefit obligation due to the impact of compounding on future years

the change in the 2007 effective income tax rate compared to the prior year is primarily attributed to prior year audit resolutions favorably impacting the 2006 effective rate the net state income tax impact of the 2006 resolutions of federal income tax audits of 15 million is included on the 2006 state income taxes line above the state income tax benefit in 2005 is largely due to the recognition of an income tax benefit of 71 million for the ohio legislative change to gradually eliminate its corporate franchise tax

the change to the total gross unrecognized tax benefits of the company during the fiscal year ended december 28 2007 is reconciled as follows 

 

of the total gross reserve for uncertain tax positions listed above 197 million of the beginning balance and 50 million of the ending balance net of federal benefit on state issues could favorably affect the effective tax rate the annual decrease in unrecognized tax benefits primarily related to settlements with the irs that resulted in a 110 million discontinued operations benefit see note 17 discontinued operations the company estimates that approximately 17 million of the unrecognized tax benefits as of december 2007 for various state and federal income tax matters will be resolved over the next 12 months the final outcome of these uncertain tax positions however is not yet determinable

fuel hedging 

in 2003 csx began a program to hedge a portion of csxt’s future locomotive fuel purchases this program was established to manage exposure to fuel price fluctuations to minimize this risk csx entered into a series of swaps ineffectiveness or the extent to which changes in the fair values of the fuel swaps did not offset changes in the fair values of the expected fuel purchases was immaterial csx suspended entering into new swaps in its fuel hedge program in 2004 and there are currently no outstanding contracts 

fuel hedging activity offset increased fuel expense for the fiscal years 2006 and 2005 by 55 million and 249 million respectively since the end of third quarter 2006 there has been no impact on fuel expense as all contracts expired prior to that time

business by segment 

tableend csx corporation “csx” and together with its subsidiaries the “company” based in jacksonville florida is one of the nation’s leading transportation companies surface transportation which includes the company’s rail and intermodal businesses provides railbased transportation services including traditional rail service and the transport of intermodal containers and trailers 

rail 

csx’s principal operating company csx transportation inc “csxt” operates the largest railroad in the eastern united states with a rail network of approximately 21000 route miles linking markets in 23 states the district of columbia and the canadian provinces of ontario and quebec 

in addition to csxt the rail segment includes total distribution services inc “tdsi” transflo terminal services inc transflo csx technology and other subsidiaries tdsi provides a network of vehicle distribution centers while transflo provides access to bulk transloading sites technology and other support services are provided by the other subsidiaries 

intermodal 

csx intermodal inc “intermodal” one of the nation’s largest coasttocoast intermodal transportation providers is a standalone integrated intermodal company linking customers to railroads via trucks and terminals containers and trailers are loaded and unloaded from trains and trucks provide the link between intermodal terminals and the customer 

surface transportation businesses 

the rail and intermodal segments are designated by the company on a combined basis as surface transportation businesses together they serve four primary lines of business which are as follows 

 

  

    

csx corporation 

part i 

  

 other revenue which includes shortline railroads owned by csx and demurrage switching and other incidental charges accounted for 2 of the company’s total 2006 revenue demurrage represents charges assessed by railroads when shippers or receivers of freight hold railcars beyond a specified period of time switching revenue is generated when csx switches cars between trains for a customer or another railroad 

other businesses 

the company also has certain residual activities from the formerly owned companies that made up the marine services segment these activities include leasing of equipment and vessels these results are included in consolidated operating income 

csx’s other holdings include csx hotels inc a resort doing business as the greenbrier located in white sulphur springs west virginia and csx real property inc an organization responsible for the management sale lease acquisition and development of company properties the results from these activities are classified as a component of other income as they are not considered by the company to be operating activities 

financial information about operating segments 

see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for operating revenue operating income and total assets by segment for each of the last three fiscal years 

competition 

csx competes within the broader transportation services marketplace the company competes directly with truck barge and other rail transportation providers although transportation modes and specific providers are in direct competition they often work cooperatively to offer services that combine modes for example railroads work with truckload carriers to offer doortodoor container and trailer services to shippers 

as global trade continues to grow and supply chains lengthen ports play an increasingly vital role this is most evident in the intermodal business where links to ports and container terminals can be a distinct competitive advantage as demand for transportation grows and potentially outpaces the expansion of supply capacity in key markets will become a competitive advantage 

shippers typically select transportation providers that offer the most compelling combination of service and price service requirements both in terms of transit time and reliability vary by shipper and commodity as a result the company’s primary competition varies by commodity and geographic location the company’s main rail competitor is norfolk southern which also operates in the eastern united states

company history 

a leader in freight rail transportation for almost 180 years csx’s roots date back to the early nineteenth century when the baltimore and ohio railroad bo—the nation’s first common carrier—was chartered in 1827

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend the following important risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the company’s forwardlooking statements although the risks described below are those that management believes are the most significant these are not the only risks facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not deem to be material also may materially affect our business financial condition or future results of operations 

new legislation or regulatory changes could increase the company’s cost of operations 

the company is subject to various regulatory jurisdictions including the surface transportation board “stb” of the united states department of transportation “dot” the federal railroad administration of the dot and other state and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic health safety labor environmental tax legal and other matters legislation passed by congress or regulations issued by these agencies can significantly affect the revenues costs and profitability of the company’s business for example additional regulations related to carbon dioxide could result in reduced coal production and higher expenses related to locomotive emissions which would adversely affect the company’s income from operations moreover the company could be negatively affected by the cost to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

in response to the heightened risk of terrorism federal state and local governmental bodies are proposing and beginning to adopt various legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry such as the customstrade partnership against terrorism this voluntary initiative was designed to strengthen a portion of the supply chain for international shipments by requiring minimum security thresholds legislation regulations or rules enacted by federal state or local governmental bodies relating to security issues that affect rail and intermodal transportation could negatively impact the company 

csxt as a common carrier by rail is required to transport hazardous materials which could expose the company to significant costs and claims 

under federal regulations csxt is required to transport hazardous materials under its common carrier obligation a rail accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury property damage and environmental penalties and remediation 

general economic and geopolitical risks may affect the company’s operations 

inflation or other changes in general economic conditions that affect demand for rail or intermodal services could adversely affect our results of operations abrupt political change or terrorist activity pose a risk of general economic disruption and could require changes in our operations and security arrangements thus increasing our operating costs these conditions may lend additional uncertainty to the timing and purchasing decisions by our customers 

furthermore fuel prices and supply are influenced by international political and economic circumstances although a fuel surcharge recovery program is in place with a considerable number of customers the company could be negatively impacted if a fuel supply shortage were to arise whether due to opec or other production restrictions lower refinery outputs a disruption of oil imports or otherwise 

  

csx corporation 

part i 

  

the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs 

the company’s operations are subject to wideranging federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions into the air discharges into water the handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases in certain circumstances environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties leased properties adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or company predecessors as well as to properties currently owned and used by the company 

the company has been and may be subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated or is strictly liable under environmental laws or regulations and such violations can result in the company’s incurring fines penalties or costs relating to the cleanup of environmental contamination although the company believes it has appropriately recorded current and longterm liabilities for known future environmental costs it could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing and may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination 

future acts of terrorism or war may cause significant disruptions in the company’s operations 

terrorist attacks such as those that occurred in the united states in september 2001 in spain in march 2004 in england in july 2005 and in india in july 2006 along with any government response to those attacks may adversely affect results of operations csxt’s rail lines or other key infrastructure may be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war this could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues in addition insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by the company could increase dramatically or the coverage may no longer be available 

increases in the number and magnitude of property damage and personal injury claims could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

the company faces inherent business risk from exposure to property damage occupational injury claims and personal injury claims resulting from train accidents worker injury claims under fela and claims from outside parties resulting from the company’s operations although the company is working diligently to enhance its safety programs and to continue to raise the awareness levels of its employees concerning safety the company could experience material property damage or personal injury or occupational claims in the future and it may incur significant costs to defend such claims 

existing claims may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in reserve estimates as the ultimate outcome of existing claims is subject to numerous factors outside of the company’s control the company establishes reserves to cover all claims however final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may differ materially from the recorded reserves 

network difficulties could have a negative impact on the company’s rail and intermodal operational efficiency 

csxt cannot be sure that it will not experience rail network difficulties related to network capacity dramatic and unplanned increases in demand for rail service or increased passenger activities in capacityconstrained areas that could have a negative impact on the company’s operational fluidity 

  

csx corporation 

part i 

  

also the company may face external factors such as severe weather conditions and other natural occurrences including floods fires hurricanes and earthquakes which may disrupt the company’s operations for information about the effects of hurricane katrina on the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity see note 5 hurricane katrina 

the company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures 

the company is subject to various existing lawsuits and potential future unknown litigation the company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend any such lawsuits additionally existing litigation may suffer adverse development not currently reflected in its reserve estimates as the ultimate outcome of existing litigation is subject to numerous factors outside of the company’s control while the company uses its best efforts to evaluate existing litigation the final judgments may differ materially from the recorded reserves 

the limited availability of qualified personnel could adversely affect the company’s operations 

changes in demographics training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel could each have a negative impact on csxt’s ability to meet demand for rail service in addition approximately 27 of the company’s workforce will be eligible for retirement within the next five years increases in demand for qualified personnel and unexpected increases in demand for rail services may aggravate these risks 

failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes work stoppages 

most of csxt’s employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements generally speaking these agreements are bargained nationally by the national carriers committee in the rail industry negotiations have generally taken place over a number of years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages over the last 30 years there were only six days of work stoppage related to labor disputes over national handling a negotiating process for new collective bargaining agreements started with the issuance of bargaining notices in november 2004 and the outcome of the current round of negotiations is uncertain at this time the existing agreements will continue to remain in effect until new agreements are reached under the railway labor act’s procedures which include mediation coolingoff periods and the possibility of presidential intervention neither party may exercise selfhelp until the procedures are exhausted

network geography 

csxt’s train operations primarily are focused around the following four major transportation networks which are defined geographically or by line of business and are described below 

coal network  – coal is used to generate more than half of the electricity in the united states the csxt coal network connects mining operations in nine states with industrial areas in the northeast and midatlantic as well as many river lake and seaport facilities these routes also support csxt’s strong and growing utility market in the southeast 

southeastern corridor  – this section of the network runs on the western side of csxt’s system between chicago and central florida through the cities of nashville birmingham and atlanta this corridor also connects the vital gateways of chicago st louis and memphis with the major markets of the southeast csxt’s capacity investment in this corridor clearly strengthens this route and makes it the premier rail route connecting these key cities and gateways with the growing southeast the corridor extends through the coal reserves of the southern illinois basin and provides direct rail service between these coal sources and the increasing demand for coal in the southeast the increase in capacity on this corridor positions csxt well to handle the projected traffic volumes of intermodal coal automotive and general merchandise traffic 

interstate 90 i90 corridor  – chicago and metropolitan areas in new york and new england are linked by csxt’s i90 corridor much of this route has two lanes of track sidebyside referred to as double mainline track supporting highspeed intermodal and automotive services the i90 corridor is also a primary route for import traffic moving across the country through chicago and into the population centers in the northeast 

interstate 95 i95 corridor  – charleston jacksonville miami and many other cities throughout the growing southeast are connected to the heavily populated northeastern cities of baltimore philadelphia and new york along csxt’s i95 corridor this route is used for certain portions of csxt’s merchandise business which primarily includes food and consumer products along with metals and chemicals 

locomotives 

csxt operates more than 3800 locomotives freight locomotives are the power source used primarily to pull rail cars switching locomotives are used in yards to sort railcars so that the right railcar gets attached to the right train in order to get it to its final destination auxiliary units are typically used to provide extra traction for heavy trains in hilly terrain at december 2006 csxt’s owned and longterm leased locomotives consisted of the following

freight car fleet 

csxt’s freight car fleet consists of five main types of cars gondolas support csxt’s coal and metals markets and provide transport for woodchips and other bulk commodities flat cars are used for shipping intermodal containers and trailers while box cars transport commodities that must be protected from the weather such as paper products appliances and building materials insulated boxcars deliver food products canned goods and certain beverages 

additionally csxt has opentop hoppers which handle heavy dry bulk commodities such as coal coke stone sand ores and gravel that are resistant to weather conditions and covered hoppers which have a permanent roof lighter bulk commodities such as grain fertilizer flour salt sugar clay and lime are shipped in large cars called jumbo covered hoppers heavier commodities like cement ground limestone and glass sand are shipped in small cubecovered hoppers finally other cars owned or leased on the network include but are not limited to center beam cars for transporting lumber and building products 

at december 2006 csxt’s owned and longterm leased freight car fleet consisted of the following 

 

 at any point in time over half of the railcars on the csxt system are not owned or leased by csxt examples of these are railcars owned by other railroads which are interchanged to csxt shipperfurnished or private cars which are generally used only in that shipper’s service and multilevel railcars 

multilevel railcars are used to transport finished motor vehicles such as sport utility vehicles and light trucks in bilevel cars while sedans and smaller automobiles are shipped in trilevel cars multilevel railcars are owned jointly by participating railroads and the fleet is managed as a nationwide pool to serve the automobile industry as noted in certain markets csxt uses railcars supplied by railroad customers for example chemical shippers typically supply tank cars for the transportation of hazardous and nonhazardous materials

 revenue increased 11 from a year ago driven by strong yield management initiatives on flat volumes continued pricing efforts fuel surcharge increases and favorable traffic mix contributed approximately 50 30 and 20 respectively of the increase in revenue per unit of 11 the company was able to achieve the substantial pricing gains due to a strong industrial economy coupled with a shortage of rail truck and barge capacity approximately 85 of csx’s revenue was subject to fuel surcharges or cost escalation clauses which include a fuel element 

certain revenue markets had strong volume increases while others were flat or down causing overall volume to be flat compared to last year coal agricultural products and emerging markets volumes were higher than a year ago these gains were offset by volume declines in the automotive phosphates and fertilizers and forest products markets 

expenses increased primarily due to higher fuel costs this was driven by a 194 million decrease in fuel hedge benefits which directly reduce fuel expense in addition there was a 13 increase in the average price per gallon of diesel fuel in 2006 other expense increases were mostly offset by a 168 million gain on insurance recoveries from hurricane katrina

the company’s continued focus on safety initiatives and operating plan execution helped all service measurements improve compared to last year within the service measures the key safety measures personal injury and train accident frequency improved by more than 20 each in 2006 these improvements were driven by continued focus on safety leadership and train accident prevention processes both use training awareness compliance measurement and root cause analysis to prevent incidents and create a safer work environment 

additionally csx produced improvement in train operations and asset utilization which drove improvements of about 50 in both ontime originations and ontime arrivals another measure of network fluidity is velocity which increased 3 for 2006 more important was the consistent week to week velocity which indicates the network delivered more reliable service to its customers the table below shows these key measurements and resources

 o ther items 

free cash flow for 2006 was 361 million which was a decrease of 669 million from a year ago last year’s amount included 10 billion from the disposition of the international terminals business excluding that one time item free cash flow compared to a year ago was higher from better earnings net of higher capital investments cash provided by operating activities gaap measure is reconciled to free cash flow nongaap measure on page 23 

consolidated capital expenditures increased 503 million to 16 billion in 2006 compared to the prior year surface transportation core capital expenditures of 14 billion were the largest components of the total and of the increase this increase was primarily due to capital expansion projects these additions were primarily for track and infrastructure with the remainder spent on locomotives freight cars and other items which include technology and facilities for growth also included in the yearoveryear increase was the replacement of property damaged by hurricane katrina

the company also announced 3 major events in 2006 a twoforone split of its common stock was approved by the csx board of directors the company also increased its quarterly postsplit dividend to 010 which represented an increase of 54 on a per share basis last csx announced a 500 million share repurchase program to be completed within the first six months of 2007 at such times as csx deems appropriate 

2007 e xpectations 

the company bases its performance expectations on external forecasts for economic indicators such as gross domestic product industrial production and overall import levels the indicators that influence csx’s businesses are expected to be favorable in 2007 but at lower growth rates than the last two years considering these and other factors the company believes that its business environment remains strong and will support consistent continuous financial improvements for the next several years 

while changes in the macro economy can impact csx’s financial results the company’s revenues are derived from fairly diversified sources and this provides stability as specific economic sectors fluctuate 

the nation’s increasing need to transport a substantially greater number of imported products across north america combined with the significant cost and environmental advantages of rail versus truck transportation should support continued pricing strength in the company’s surface transportation businesses in addition recent and continued improvements in the company’s operations and infrastructure are expected to result in volume growth and higher margins over time 

considering the company’s solid overall business environment along with momentum in its underlying business performance csx expects that its financial performance in 2007 will be consistent with its longterm financial targets which include compounded annual growth rates “cagr” as shown below 

 

 to reinforce its longterm vision the company’s capital budget is expected to be 14 billion in 2007 approximately 76 is being allocated to maintaining existing rail infrastructure and expanding capacity in key corridors the remaining 24 is being invested in locomotives and freight cars along with certain technology improvements the company anticipates using cash from operations to fund these projects additionally csx anticipates free cash flow of approximately 500 million in 2007 see page 23 for how free cash flow is calculated

in january 2007 the surface transportation board “stb” announced its new policy on railroad fuel surcharges that will govern shipments regulated by the stb commonly referred to as tariff movements the stb determined that in the future fuel surcharges should be based on movementspecific factors such as distance andor weight rather than as a percentage of revenue most of csxt’s shipments are not regulated by the stb ruling however the company is analyzing the application of a movementspecific fuel surcharge to both its regulated and nonregulated shipments at this time csx does not believe this will result in a significant change to future revenue but is still evaluating the overall impact 

on february 14 2007 csx announced a 20 billion share repurchase program and an increased quarterly dividend on the company’s common stock of 20 to 012 per share the company intends to complete the repurchase program by the end of 2008 this new authority also terminated the unused portion under the previously announced 500 million program 

free cash flow 

free cash flow is considered a nongaap financial measure under sec regulation g disclosure of nongaap measures management believes however that free cash flow is important in evaluating the company’s financial performance and measures an ability to generate cash without incurring additional external financing free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than a substitute for cash provided by operating activities 

free cash flow is calculated by generally taking cash from operations and subtracting property additions dividends paid and certain other investing activities these other investing activities include proceeds from sale of businesses insurance proceeds and other items also added to free cash flow is csx’s 42 economic interest in conrail’s free cash flow which is not consolidated in csx amounts other deposits which are included in cash provided by operating activities are not included in the company’s free cash flow because these deposits represent assets that are set aside for certain future debt payments 

the following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities gaap measure to free cash flow nongaap measure 

 

 a property additions have increased since prior year due to capital expansion projects and the replacement of property damaged by hurricane katrina

operating income 

operating income increased 588 million to 21 billion in 2006 which was driven by increased operating revenues these revenue gains and gains on insurance proceeds from hurricane katrina were partially offset by increases in fuel expense caused by higher fuel prices and lower hedge benefits 

other income 

other income decreased 6 million to 95 million in 2006 this change was driven primarily by lower real estate sales which was partially offset by a noncash gain on additional conrail property value received in connection with the 2004 conrail spinoff transaction 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased 31 million to 392 million in 2006 compared to the prior year there was lower interest expense from lower average debt balances for 2006 due to a 10 billion debt repurchase in mid2005 however this savings was partially offset by higher variable interest rates 

income tax expense 

income tax expense increased 215 million to 531 million in 2006 as a result of higher earnings this increase was partially offset by the net impact of favorable resolutions of certain tax matters in 2006 that were higher than benefits last year 

net earnings 

net earnings for 2006 increased 165 million to 13 billion with earnings per share up 30 to 282 per diluted share for the prior year this increase was primarily due to the following factors

operating income 

operating income increased 550 million to 16 billion in 2005 as a result of increased operating revenue operating expenses remained relatively flat compared to the prior year 

other income 

despite the absence of the 16 million net noncash gain after tax related to the conrail spinoff transaction other income increased 29 million to 101 million in 2005 primarily as a result of gains from real estate sales 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased 12 million to 423 million in 2005 compared to the prior year in june 2005 csx repurchased 10 billion of its publiclytraded notes as a result of the debt repurchase interest expense was reduced the savings from june through december were mostly offset by rising variable interest rates 

income tax expense 

income tax expense increased 97 million to 316 million in 2005 as a result of higher earnings from continuing operations additionally the effective income tax rate decreased from 34 in 2004 to 30 in 2005 primarily due to legislative changes in ohio that will gradually eliminate the ohio corporate franchise tax

2006 vs 2005 rail results of operations 

rail operating revenue 

csxt categorizes rail revenue in three main lines of business merchandise coal and automotive revenue for csxt increased 898 million or 12 to 82 billion in 2006 from a year ago continued yield management and fuel surcharge were the primary drivers of revenue per unit gains 

merchandise 

chemicals – revenue and revenue per unit improved by capitalizing on a continued strong pricing environment overall volume was down slightly because high raw material costs continued to negatively affect the us chemical industry’s competitiveness and in turn csx volumes 

emerging markets – growth was driven by increased shipments of municipal waste military and aggregate products which include rocks and sand revenue per unit also improved due to strong pricing actions 

forest products – shipment of building products and printing paper slowed due to the decline in residential housing starts and electronic media conversion however revenue and revenue per unit improved due to a favorable pricing environment 

agriculture products – strong domestic demand in feed grain soybean ethanol and export shipments supported volume and revenue per unit in addition strong export demand for grain and increased shipments of beans helped volume growth 

metals – revenue and revenue per unit increased due to continued pricing gains and fuel surcharge coverage volume increased slightly driven by strong steel demand in the energy and nonresidential construction endmarkets these gains were partially offset by lower demand for steel in the automotive sector 

phosphates and fertilizers – volume declined from lower export shipments due to increased international phosphate production which caused several domestic phosphate plants to close favorable mix coupled with price increases resulted in significantly improved revenue per unit 

food and consumer – volume growth in alcoholic beverages canned goods and rice and beans was offset by softness in building products perishables and the appliance markets strong pricing actions and a focus on longer more profitable shipments increased revenue and revenue per unit 

coal 

revenue and volume improvements were due to increased shipments of utility and export coal utility companies built up their inventories which was a major contributor to csx’s volume growth revenue per unit increased due to the continued favorable pricing environment and increased fuel surcharge coverage 

automotive 

volume declined due to a reduction in north american light vehicle production consistent with the overall automotive market csx’s volumes continued to shift from the big 3 to foreign brands produced domestically revenue per unit was favorable due to prices increases and fuel surcharge

rail operating expense 

total rail operating expenses for 2006 increased 341 million or 6 to 63 billion compared to the prior year the description of what is included in each category as well as significant year over year changes are described below 

labor and fringe expenses include employee compensation and benefit programs these expenses are primarily affected by inflation headcount wage rates incentives earned healthcare plan costs and inflation and pension and other postretirement plan expenses these expenses increased 63 million primarily due to wage and benefit inflation and increased staffing in rail operations 

materials supplies and other expenses consist primarily of materials and contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment and for terminal services at intermodal and automotive facilities this category also includes costs related to personal injury claims environmental remediation derailments utilities nonlocomotive fuel property and sales taxes and professional services these costs increased by 113 million in 2006 primarily due to materials inflation along with prior year casualty favorable adjustments and supplier reimbursements that were not repeated these costs were partially offset by productivity gains from improved operations such as efficient use of locomotives 

depreciation expense primarily relates to capital costs for locomotives railcars and track structure which includes rail ties and other track material this expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year this expense increased 39 million due to a larger asset base related to higher capital spending 

fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel this expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel offset by the effects of any hedging activities this expense increased 329 million primarily due to reduced hedge benefit from the expiration of the fuel hedge program as well as higher fuel prices 

equipment and other rents primarily includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies net of rents received by csxt for use of csxt equipment this category of expenses also includes lease expenses primarily for locomotives railcars containers and trailers office and other rentals these expenses decreased 18 million due mainly to improvement in operational fluidity which drove improvements in asset utilization 

inland transportation expense included in the rail segment amounts paid to csxt from intermodal for shipments on csxt’s network these intercompany charges are eliminated in consolidated results 

conrail rents fees and services include transportation switching and terminal service charges paid to conrail for the shared area purchase price amortization relating to the conrail purchase and csx’s 42 share of conrail’s income the 10 million increase in expense was primarily due to prior year federal income tax benefits that were recognized by conrail but not repeated in 2006 

gain on insurance recoveries includes gains on insurance recoveries related to hurricane katrina the 166 million for 2006 represented cash received for lost profits and higher replacement value of property compared to the value of the property that was damaged after consideration of the company’s insurance deductible

2006 vs 2005 intermodal results of operations 

intermodal operating income increased 8 or 20 million versus last year driven by revenue gains of 50 million along with expense containment the increase in revenue and revenue per unit was driven by the continued yield management emphasis which was partially offset by mix of traffic volume increased slightly due to continued growth of imported consumer goods from asia as well as the strength in the truckload market offset by weaker demand in services sold to transportation brokers known as wholesale markets 

intermodal operating expense increased 30 million primarily driven by an increase in fuel costs that are reflected in inland transportation expense fuel costs were higher due to rising market prices partially offsetting the increase in fuel were efficiency gains related to equipment utilization

2005 vs 2004 rail results of operations 

rail operating revenue 

csxt categorizes rail revenue in three main lines of business merchandise coal coke and iron ore and automotive overall revenue increased 562 million or 8 to 73 billion in 2005 from 67 billion in 2004 

merchandise 

all merchandise markets experienced revenue growth primarily driven by yield improvement efforts and the company’s fuel surcharge program overall merchandise revenue grew 6 to a record 42 billion while revenue per unit also achieved record levels increasing 9 volume declined 3 due to several factors including an additional week in 2004 impacts of hurricane katrina and shedding of lowmargin traffic individual market results are as follows 

chemicals – in addition to production disruption from hurricanes katrina and rita chemicals volumes were negatively impacted by high natural gas prices and generally high raw materials inventories 

emerging markets – emerging markets volumes and revenue were negatively impacted by a significant reduction in shipments of high revenue per unit military traffic 

forest products – forest products also experienced high revenue per unit increases because of both a favorable pricing environment and a favorable mix shift from short haul lowmargin traffic towards longer haul more profitable traffic 

agricultural products – despite strong soybean and corn harvests and increased export demand for grain volume in agricultural products was flat due to declines in processed products such as flour sweeteners and vegetable oils 

metals – metals volumes decreased by 5 however the pricing environment remained very favorable and resulted in the highest revenue per unit growth within merchandise at 17 

phosphate and fertilizers – phosphate and fertilizer volumes were down due to high international inventories of phosphates during the first half of the year and several csxtserved plant curtailments or closures during 2005 both the chemicals and phosphate and fertilizer groups experienced high revenue per unit increases of 8 and 9 respectively 

food and consumer – food and consumer experienced volume growth due to a continued shift of traffic previously handled by trucks to rail and the acquisition of newly finished railcars to other shippers 

coal 

revenues increased by 17 to a record 21 billion due to both strong volume growth of 5 and revenue per unit improvements of 12 driven by a favorable pricing environment and csxt’s fuel surcharge program most markets experienced strong demand as utility inventory levels remained below target levels csxt also reached a settlement agreement in a rate case that resulted in an additional 17 million of revenue in 2005

automotive 

overall volume was down 4 as north american light vehicle production was flat compared to the prior year however vehicle production for the big 3 was unfavorable 6 including permanent closures of three general motors plants served by csxt growth in new shipments from the newlyopened hyundai plant in montgomery al continued to partially offset these declines revenue per unit grew 5 on strong yield management and increases in fuel surcharge rates and coverage resulting in record revenue per unit levels revenue per unit gains more than offset volume weakness and drove overall revenue growth of 1 compared to the prior year 

rail operating expense 

total rail operating expenses increased 102 million or 2 in 2005 compared to the prior year a brief description of what is included in each category is described in the 2006 vs 2005 results 

labor and fringe expense increased 114 million compared to the prior year primarily due to increases in incentive compensation and the effects of inflation 

materials supplies and other expenses increased 44 million primarily due to the effects of inflation higher reserve requirements for uncollectible accounts and increased legal fees resulting from the litigation and resolution of certain matters 

depreciation expense increased 115 million primarily due to additional assets received as a result of the conrail spinoff transaction the rail segment had property additions of approximately 11 billion 

fuel expense increased 127 million in 2005 net of 249 million of fuel hedging benefits compared to the prior year primarily due to fuel price increases fuel hedging activity had a 63 million favorable impact on fuel expense for the fiscal year ended december 31 2004 the average price per gallon of diesel fuel including benefits from csx’s fuel hedging program was 131 in 2005 versus 110 in 2004 in addition the fuel surcharge programs and contractual cost escalation clauses used in most multiyear customer contracts partially offset fuel cost increases 

equipment and other rents decreased 28 million in 2005 as a result of decreased overall volume and lower locomotive lease expense 

inland transportation decreased 12 million compared to the prior year the offsetting expense associated with this amount is reflected in intermodal’s operating expense and is thus eliminated at the consolidated level 

conrail rents fees and services expense decreased 191 million in 2005 as a result of the conrail spinoff transaction which decreased rents paid to conrail as assets previously leased from conrail are now owned directly by csxt additionally conrail received a tax benefit from the resolution of various federal income tax audit adjustments during 2005 which increases csx’s equity earnings and offsets conrail rents fees  services 

2005 vs 2004 intermodal results of operations 

operating income increased 63 or 96 million in 2006 continued focus on longer hauls in higher density lanes coupled with sustained strength in pricing increased revenue per unit volume was down primarily due to ongoing yield management efforts and a continued focus on network operations designed to increase efficiencies and reduce indirect routing 

  

csx corporation

expenses decreased 7 compared to the prior year due to continued service improvements an emphasis on equipment utilization and a decrease in volume as discussed above a decline in trucking expenses associated with linehaul moves led to a significant decrease in operating costs associated with a reduction in services several productivity initiatives within terminal operations generated efficiencies driving perunit cost reductions compared to the prior year 

l iquidity and c apital r esources 

liquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned operational growth in order to have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity its balance sheet sources and uses of cash flow and external factors should be reviewed 

material changes in the consolidated balance sheets 

csx’s balance sheet continues to reflect a strong liquidity position and capital base in 2006 cash which includes cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased 298 million to 900 million this increase was primarily due to higher cash from operations offset by higher capital spending 

current maturities of longterm debt decreased by 344 million versus last year principally related to the reclassification of the company’s convertible debt in october 2006 debt holders had the option to require csx to purchase their debentures however no significant balances were presented for payment because the next option date is in 2008 the debentures are reflected as longterm debt in the consolidated balance sheets this reclassification increased the company’s working capital as discussed below see note 9 debt and credit agreements for additional details 

working capital can be considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its shortterm needs csx’s working capital at december 2006 was 150 million compared to a deficit of 607 million last year this increase of 757 million year over year was driven by better earnings that produced higher cash and shortterm investments at year end also current liabilities were lower by 457 million primarily due to the convertible debentures being reclassified into longterm debt as described above the company believes that in future periods working capital may return to a deficit a working capital deficit is not unusual for csx or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity the company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due csx has sufficient financial capacity including the revolving line of credit and shelf registration to manage its daytoday cash requirements and any anticipated obligations 

sources and uses of cash 

csx has multiple sources of and required uses of its cash csx generates substantial cash balances from its operations its financing sources of cash include strong access to the capital markets as well as a significant longterm credit facility uses of cash include significant annual reinvestment in infrastructure and equipment as well as scheduled payments of debt and leases with manageable nearterm maturities the company’s cash requirements also include any declared dividends to shareholders 

cash provided by operations in 2006 was 21 billion which was 10 billion higher than a year ago this change was driven mostly by higher earnings from operations additionally the company made lower cash income tax payments in 2006 primarily due to large cash income tax payments made in 2005 related to the sale of the international terminals business 

  

csx corporation 

part ii 

  

credit facilities are an untapped source of funding available to csx csx has a 125 billion fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in may 2011 see note 9 debt and credit agreements for more information 

csx also has a 900 million shelf registration it may be used subject to market conditions and csx board authorization to issue debt or equity securities at csx’s discretion csx presently intends to use the proceeds to finance cash requirements including refinancing existing debt as it matures while csx seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to meeting such needs there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit csx to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time or at all 

during 2006 the primary use of cash was to fund property additions and capital expansion projects net cash used by investing activities was 16 billion in 2006 compared to 36 million last year this change was attributable primarily to the utilization of 10 billion of cash proceeds received from the disposition of csx’s international terminals business in 2005 additionally the company spent approximately 500 million more for capital additions in 2006 this included additions for property damaged by hurricane katrina 

the company completed a debt repurchase of 10 billion last year which drove the change in financing activities between 2006 and 2005 financing activities used cash of 296 million during 2006 compared to cash used of 13 billion during 2005 additionally in 2006 there was cash used for the share repurchase program partially offset by an increase in cash from proceeds of stock option exercises the company anticipates moderately increased use of debt in funding its future cash requirements 

dividend payments are another use of cash the company paid dividends of 145 million in 2006 52 million more than last year the increase in 2006 was primarily due to the company increasing poststocksplit dividends by 54 on a per share basis to 010 per share 

on february 14 2007 csx announced a 20 billion share repurchase program and an increased quarterly dividend on the company’s common stock of 20 to 012 per share the company intends to complete the repurchase program by the end of 2008 the timing and amount of repurchase transactions will be determined by the company’s management based on their evaluation of market conditions share price and other factors the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time csx will use cash on hand and cash from operations to fund the share repurchase and the dividend increase 

external factors 

credit ratings can also be considered an indicator of a company’s liquidity and access to capital the ratings ranked on a spectrum ranging between highest credit quality on one end and “junk” on the other longterm credit ratings are denoted with a letter aaa is the highest credit quality and c or d depending on the rating agency is the lowest or junk quality any rating of bbb or higher is considered to be investment grade csx’s ratings along with other large us class i freight railroads fall within the investment grade category 

csx’s longterm unsecured debt obligations were rated bbb and baa2 by standard  poor’s and moody’s investors services respectively both with a “stable” outlook as of december 29 2006 csx’s shortterm commercial paper program was rated a2 and p2 by these agencies respectively 

if csx’s longterm unsecured bond ratings were reduced to bbb and baa3 its undrawn borrowing costs under the 125 billion revolving credit facility would not materially increase if csx’s 

  

csx corporation

shortterm commercial paper ratings were reduced to a3 and p3 it would increase borrowing costs in the commercial paper market and reduce access to this source of funds because of the more limited demand for lower rated commercial paper csx had no commercial paper outstanding at december 29 2006 or december 30 2005

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results may differ from those estimates these estimates and assumptions are discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors on a regular basis consistent with the prior year significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas

casualty environmental and legal reserves 

casualty 

casualty reserves represent accruals for personal injury and occupational injury claims occupational injury claims are broken down into two main categories asbestos and other currently no individual claim value is expected to exceed the company’s selfinsurance retention amount if an individual claim did exceed the amount insurance is available as more specifically detailed in note 7 commitments and contingencies personal injury and occupational claims are recorded on a gross basis and in accordance with sfas 5 accounting for contingencies “sfas 5” to the extent the value of an individual claim were to exceed the selfinsured retention amount the company would record the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries these reserves fluctuate with estimates provided by independent third parties reviewed by management and are offset by the timing of payments most of the claims are related to csxt unless otherwise noted 

the amounts recorded by the company for casualtyrelated liabilities are based upon currently known information and judgments based upon that information projecting future events such as the number of new claims to be filed each year the average cost of disposing of claims as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding asbestos and other occupational litigation or legislation in the united states could cause the actual costs to be higher or lower than projected 

while the final outcome of casualtyrelated matters cannot be predicted with certainty considering among other items the meritorious legal defenses available and the liabilities that have been recorded it is the opinion of management that none of these items when finally resolved will have a material effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition or liquidity however should a number of these items occur in the same period they could have a material effect on the results of operations financial condition or liquidity in a particular quarter or fiscal year

personal injury represents liabilities for employee workrelated and thirdparty injuries workrelated injuries for csxt employees are primarily subject to the federal employers’ liability act “fela” in addition to the fela liabilities employees of other csx subsidiaries are covered by various state workers’ compensation laws the federal longshore and harbor worker’s compensation program andor the maritime jones act 

csxt retains an independent actuarial firm to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims and cases an analysis is performed by the independent actuarial firm semiannually and is reviewed by management the company will monitor actual experience against the number of forecasted claims to be received and expected claim payments the methodology used by the actuary included a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims which was based largely on csxt’s historical claims and settlement experience actual results may vary from estimates due to the type and severity of the injury costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation 

occupational 

occupational claims include allegations of exposure to certain materials in the work place such as asbestos solvents which include soaps and chemicals and diesel fuel and alleged chronic physical injuries such as repetitive stress injuries carpal tunnel syndrome or hearing loss

asbestos 

the company is party to a number of occupational claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the workplace the heaviest possible exposure for employees was due to work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines that were largely phased out beginning around the 1950’s however other types of exposures including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials continued until it was substantially eliminated by 1985 

csxt retains a thirdparty specialist who has extensive experience in performing asbestos and other occupational studies to assist in this estimate the analysis is performed by the specialist semiannually and is reviewed by management the company will monitor actual experience against the number of forecasted claims to be received and expected claim payments the objective of the analysis is to determine the number of estimated incurred but not reported “ibnr” claims and the estimated average cost per claim to be received over the next seven years seven years was determined by management to be the time period in which probable claim filings and claim values could be estimated with more certainty 

the company with the assistance of the third party specialist determines its potentially exposed population from which it is able to derive the estimated number of ibnr claims the estimated average cost per claim is then determined utilizing recent actual average cost per claim data and national industry data key elements of the assessment include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

   

csx corporation 

part ii 

  

from these assumptions the company projects the incidence of each type of disease to the estimated population to determine the total estimated number of employees that could potentially assert a claim historical claim filing rates are applied for each type of disease to the total number of employees that could potentially assert a claim to determine the total number of anticipated claim filings by disease type historical dismissal rates which represent claims that are closed without payment are deducted to calculate the number of future claims by disease type that would likely require payment by the company finally the number of such claims is multiplied by the average settlement value to estimate the company’s future liability for ibnr asbestos claims 

in 2005 management updated their estimate of the unasserted liability exposure with the assistance of the third party specialists which resulted in recognition of a 48 million favorable change associated with asbestos liabilities net 38 million favorable change for all occupational liabilities during 2004 and 2005 asbestosrelated disease claims filed against csx dropped substantially particularly bulk claims filed by certain law firms in 2003 the company received a significant number of filings the company believes the number was attributable to an attempt to file before a new more restrictive venue law took effect in west virginia in mid2003 as a result management reassessed the calibration period from a fouryear average to a threeyear average excluding the surge in claims originating in west virginia as mentioned before management believes this calibration period represents the best estimate of future filing rates there have been no significant changes in 2006 

the estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for this reserve a 1 increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of ibnr claims or the average claim values would result in an approximate 1 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted asbestos claims 

the company with the assistance of the third party specialist obtains semiannual updates of the study 

other occupational 

the company engages a third party specialist to assist in projecting the number of other occupational injury claims to be received over the next seven years based on this analysis the company establishes reserves for the probable and reasonably estimable other occupational injury liabilities 

similar to the asbestos liability estimation process the key elements of the assessment include the following 

 

  

   

csx corporation 

part ii 

  

 during 2005 csxt experienced an unfavorable trend in settlement values for repetitive stress and other injuries which resulted in the recognition of a 10 million unfavorable change in estimate associated with these liabilities there have been no significant changes in 2006 

the estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for this reserve a 1 increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of ibnr claims or the average claim values would result in an approximate 1 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted other occupational claims 

environmental 

the company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party “prp” at approximately 254 environmentally impaired sites many of which are or may be subject to remedial action under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 “cerla” also known as the superfund law or similar state statutes the majority of these proceedings arise from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations however a number of these proceedings are based on allegations to the effect that the company or its predecessors sent hazardous substances for disposal to facilities owned or operated by others 

in addition some of the company’s land holdings are and have been leased to others for commercial or industrial operations that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the company 

in any such proceedings the company is potentially subject to environmental cleanup obligations and enforcement actions under cerla or similar state laws which may impose joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs these costs could be substantial on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct in 2004 the company assumed 6 million of conrail environmental liabilities due to the conrail transaction 

at least once each quarter csxt reviews its role with respect to each such location giving consideration to a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

 in accordance with statement of position 961 environmental remediation liabilities  at least once a quarter the company reviews its role and plans for remediation with respect to each site 

  

csx corporation 

part ii 

  

identified based on this review the company records amounts to cover anticipated contingent future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are estimable and probable the recorded liabilities are undiscounted and include amounts representing the company’s estimate of unasserted claims which the company believes to be immaterial the liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated insurance recoveries 

currently the company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amount of additional liabilities if any on some sites until completion of future environmental studies in addition latent conditions at any given location could result in exposure the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reliably estimated based upon information currently available however the company believes its environmental reserves are adequate to accomplish remedial actions to comply with present laws and regulations and that the ultimate liability for these matters if any will not materially affect its overall results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

legal 

in accordance with sfas 5 an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated if no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred 

the company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above the amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings newly discovered or developed evidence or changes in laws regulations and evidentiary standards 

pension and postretirement medical plan accounting 

the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried management personnel the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement employees hired after december 31 2002 are covered by a cash balance plan which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age service and compensation 

in addition to these plans csx sponsors one postretirement medical plan and one life insurance plan that provide benefits to fulltime salaried management employees hired prior to january 1 2003 upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met the postretirement medical plan is contributory partially funded by retirees with retiree contributions adjusted annually the life insurance plan is noncontributory 

the accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in sfas 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132 r “sfas 158”  sfas 87 employers accounting for pensions 

  

csx corporation 

part ii 

  

“sfas 87” and sfas 106 employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pension “sfas 106” 

sfas 87 requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 these assumptions are determined as of the beginning of the year as permitted by sfas 87 the company has elected to use a plan measurement date of september 30 to actuarially value its pension and postretirement plans as required by sfas 158 csx will change its measurement date to the fiscal year end in 2008 the company engages independent external actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the company selects as of the beginning of the plan year the company reviews the longterm rate of return discount salary scale inflation and health care cost trend rates on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends as appropriate 

in september 2006 fasb issued sfas 158 which changed the accounting rules for reporting and disclosures related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans companies are now required to include on the balance sheet an additional asset or liability to reflect the funded status of retirement and other postretirement benefit plans and a corresponding aftertax adjustment to equity retroactive application of this accounting rule is prohibited therefore 2006 is presented as required by sfas 158 and 2005 is presented as required under the accounting rules prior to sfas 158 the adoption in 2006 had no effect on the computation of net periodic benefit expense for pensions and postretirement benefits see note 8 employee benefit plans for the impact on the consolidated balance sheet effective 2008 csx will be required to change the measurement date for postretirement benefit plans from september 30 to the last day of the fiscal year 

longterm rate of return on plan assets 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation in estimating that rate the company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment 

the company’s expected longterm average rate of return on assets considers the current and projected asset mix of the funds management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected longterm rate of return on assets as this assumption is longterm it is adjusted less frequently than other assumptions used in pension accounting the longterm rate of return on plan assets used by the company to value its 2006 pension obligation was 85 

discount rates 

discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component of pension and postretirement expense assumed discount rates reflect the rates at which both of these 

  

csx corporation 

part ii 

benefits could be effectively settled it is appropriate in estimating those rates to look to available information about rates implicit in current prices of annuity contracts that could be used to settle these obligations in making those estimates employers may also look to rates of return on high quality fixedincome investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits the company determines the discount rate based on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows matching the plans’ expected benefit payments the discount rates used by the company to value its 2006 pension and postretirement obligations are 575 and 55 respectively the company uses a different discount rate for pension and postretirement benefits due to the different time horizons of future payments for each of the plans for pensions the time horizon is approximately 12 years while for postretirement the time horizon is approximately 8 years 

each year these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates if interest rates generally decline or rise the assumed discount rates will change 

salary scale inflation rates 

salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the company the company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates the company used a salary scale rate of 41 to value its 2006 pension obligation 

health care cost trend rates 

health care cost trend rates are based on recent plan experience and industry trends the company uses actuarial data to substantiate the inflation assumption for health care costs representing increases in total plan costs which include claims and administrative fee cost components the current assumed health care cost trend rate is 10 for medicareeligible participants and 11 for nonmedicareeligible participants and is expected to decrease gradually until reaching 45 in 2014 based upon current actuarial projections 

other assumptions 

the calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to mortality rates turnover and retirement age these assumptions are based upon historical data and are approved by management 

2007 estimated pension and postretirement expense 

net periodic pension and postretirement benefits expense for 2007 is expected to be approximately 54 million and 25 million respectively compared to 62 million and 30 million respectively in 2006 

the following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effect of changes in certain assumptions like discount rates salaries and health care costs on the 2007 estimated pension and postretirement expense 

 

   

csx corporation 

part ii 

  

the discount rate for pension and postretirement plans has an inverse relationship with the expense calculation meaning that as the discount rate increases expense decreases and vice versa the other assumptions above have a direct relationship with expense 

pension protection act 

in august 2006 the president of the united states signed the pension protection act of 2006 into law included in this legislation are changes to the method of valuing pension plan assets and liabilities for funding purposes as well as the minimum funding levels required by 2008 csx is determining what impact the new requirements will have on the company’s cash flow however initial estimates forecast a 2008 unfunded liability of approximately 185 million after tax this estimate will be affected by future contributions investment returns on plan assets and interest rates under the transition rules provided csx must begin the funding of this 2008 shortfall no later than 2009 and must complete the funding by 2014 the company anticipates funding pension contributions with cash from operations 

depreciation policies for assets under the grouplife method 

csxt accounts for its rail assets including mainline track locomotives and freight cars using the grouplife method the grouplife method pools similar assets by type and then depreciates each group as a whole under the grouplife method the service lives for each group of rail assets are determined by completing periodic life studies and applying management’s assumptions concerning the service lives of its properties these life studies are conducted by a third party expert analyzed by the company’s management and approved by the stb life studies for equipment assets are required every three years whereas road and track life studies are required every six years by the stb 

changes in asset lives due to the results of the life studies could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense and thus the company’s results of operations factors taken into account during the life study include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the life studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the appropriate amount indicated by the study any such deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining useful life of the asset group until the next required life study 

recent experience with life studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes which did not significantly affect the company’s annual depreciation expense in 2006 csxt initiated a life study for its equipment assets with approval and adoption expected in early 2007 csxt does not expect the life study to have a material effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition or liquidity in a particular quarter or fiscal year 

assets depreciated under the grouplife method comprise 95 of csxt’s total fixed assets of 203 billion on a net basis at december 29 2006 the company’s depreciation expense for the year 

  

csx corporation 

part ii 

  

ended december 29 2006 amounted to 867 million a one percent change in the average life of all grouplife assets would result in an 8 million change to the company’s annual depreciation expense 

income taxes 

management uses factors such as applicable law current information and past experience with similar issues in computing its income tax expense the company has not materially changed its methodology for calculating income tax expense for the years presented 

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued interpretation 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  “fin 48” which will be effective for csx beginning in 2007 fin 48 provides guidance on measurement classification interest and penalties and disclosures of uncertain tax positions differences between the amounts recognized in the financial statements prior to the adoption of fin 48 and the amounts recognized after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulativeeffect adjustment the company is currently evaluating the impact of fin 48 on its consolidated financial statements but is not yet in a position to make this determination 

csx files a consolidated federal income tax return which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries examinations of the federal income tax returns of csx have been completed through 1998 federal income tax returns for 1997 through 2005 currently are under examination management believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed while the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty it is the opinion of csx management that none of these items will have a materially adverse effect on the results of operations financial condition or liquidity of csx an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items however could have a materially adverse effect on the results of operations financial condition or liquidity in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year also the company is party to a number of legal and administrative proceedings the resolution of which could result in gain realization in amounts that could be material to results of operations financial condition or liquidity in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

csx addresses market risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and the risk of volatility in its fuel costs through the use of derivative financial instruments csx does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

csx addresses its exposure to interest rate market risk through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of interest rate swap agreements the table below illustrates csx’s longterm interest rate swap sensitivity 

 

   

csx corporation 

part ii 

  

during 2003 csx began a program to hedge its exposure to fuel price volatility through swap transactions in the third quarter of 2004 csx suspended entering into new swaps in its fuel hedge program the remainder of the fuel hedge contracts expired in july 2006 

csx is exposed to loss in the event of nonperformance by any counterparty to the interest rate swap agreements csx does not anticipate nonperformance by such counterparties and no material loss would be expected from nonperformance 

the following table highlights csx’s floating rate debt outstanding exclusive of derivative contracts that essentially converts fixed interest rate notes to floating interest rates

  slsi also holds certain residual assets and liabilities as a result of prior divestitures and discontinuances a whollyowned subsidiary of csx retains the rights to those assets and indemnifies dpi slsi and related entities against those liabilities pursuant to a separate agreement csx guarantees the obligations of its subsidiary under this separate agreement 

  consequently the results of operations and financial position of the company’s international terminals business are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

3 divestitures 

   in february 2003 csx conveyed most of its interest in its domestic containershipping subsidiary csx lines llc “csx lines” to a new venture formed with the carlyle group for approximately 300 million gross cash proceeds of approximately 240 million 214 million net of transaction costs and 60 million of securities csx lines was subsequently renamed horizon lines llc “horizon” horizon subleased vessels and equipment from certain affiliates of csx covering the primary financial obligations related to 265 million of leases under which csx or one of its affiliates will remain a lessee sublessor or guarantor a deferred pretax gain of approximately 127 million as a result of the transaction is being recognized over the 12year sublease term the securities contained a term of 7 years and a preferred return feature during the third quarter of 2003 csx received a 15 million payment from horizon lines which included 3 million of interest in return of a portion of its investment in horizon the investing section of the 2003 consolidated statement of cash flows includes proceeds from divestiture of 226 million and 3 million of interest on investment is included in net earnings

risk factors 

competition 

  the company experiences competition from other transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and to a less significant extent barges ships and pipelines transportation providers such as motor carriers and barges utilize public rightsofway that are built and maintained by governmental entities while csx and other railroads must build and maintain its network through the utilization of internal resources if the scope and quality of these alternative methods of transportation are materially increased or if legislation is passed providing materially greater opportunity for motor carriers with respect to size or weight restrictions there could be a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

employees and labor union relationships 

  the company considers employee relations with most of its unions generally to be good most of csxt’s employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements the bargaining agreements contain a moratorium clause that precludes serving new bargaining demands until a certain date these agreements which usually are bargained nationally by the national railway labor conference “nrlc” normally contain the same moratorium date so all bargaining on agreement changes generally begins at approximately the same time a round of bargaining started in 2000 when the moratorium provisions expired agreements have been reached with all but one of the unions two of those agreements are out for ratifications negotiations with the union representing the machinists are in mediation the machinists have asked the national mediation board to be released from mediation and the railroads have opposed that request a new round of bargaining commenced in 2004 

  also the agreements which were concluded in the 2000 bargaining round are now open for renegotiation the process of renegotiating these agreements commenced in early november 2004 when the parties were free to serve their bargaining demands the outcome of the 2004 round of negotiations is uncertain at this time 

  in the rail industry negotiations have generally taken place over a number of years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages the existing agreements continue to remain in effect until new agreements are reached the parties are not permitted to either strike or lockout until the railway labor act’s lengthy procedures which include mediation coolingoff periods and the possibility of presidential intervention are exhausted

fuel costs 

  fuel costs represent a significant expense of csx surface transportation operations fuel prices can vary significantly from period to period and significant increases may have a material adverse effect on the company’s operating results furthermore fuel prices and supply are influenced considerably by international political and economic circumstances if a fuel supply shortage arose from opec production restrictions a disruption of oil imports or otherwise fuel shortages higher fuel prices and any subsequent price increases could despite the company’s fuel surcharge programs materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity 

future acts of terrorism or war 

  terrorist attacks such as those that occurred on september 11 2001 or in madrid spain on march 11 2004 any government response thereto and war may adversely affect results of operations financial condition and liquidity the company’s rail lines and physical plant may be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror which could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues and have a material adverse effect on operating results financial condition or liquidity in addition insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by the company could increase dramatically or the coverage may no longer be available 

regulation and legislation 

  the company is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the surface transportation board “stb” of the united states department of transportation “dot” the federal railroad administration of dot and other state and federal regulatory agencies as to rail operations and for a variety of health safety labor environmental and other matters legislation passed by congress or regulations issued by these organizations can significantly affect the costs and profitability of the company’s business in addition the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company

financial results of operations 

   csx follows a 5253 week fiscal reporting calendar fiscal year 2004 consisted of a 53week year ending on december 31 2004 fiscal year 2003 consisted of 52 weeks ending on december 26 2003 the results of operations of the company’s international terminals business are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

  

 

 

   operating revenue increased 454 million for the year ended december 31 2004 to 80 billion compared to 76 billion for the prior year primarily due to continued yield management strategies as all major markets showed yearoveryear improvement in revenuepercar coupled with the company’s fuel surcharge program 

   operating income for the year ended december 31 2004 increased 480 million to 10 billion compared to 520 million in the prior year operating expenses decreased 26 million to 7 billion for the fiscal year ended december 31 2004 principally due to the absence of charges totaling 340 million taken in 2003 for 1 the provision for casualty claims and 2 the additional loss on sale 

   other income decreased 21 million to 72 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to 93 million for the prior year primarily due to a decline in income from real estate and resort operations this decrease was partially offset by the net gain of 16 million after tax related to the conrail spinoff transaction 

   interest expense increased 17 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to the prior year comparable period due to decreased benefits from interest rate swaps and the exchange of conrail debt as a result of the conrail spinoff transaction 

   earnings from continuing operations were 418 million or 187 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to 137 million or 63 cents per diluted share for the prior year 

  losses from discontinued operations net of tax were 79 million or 35 cents per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to earnings of 52 million or 23 cents per diluted share for the prior year discontinued operations for the period ended december 31 2004 includes international terminals’ net earnings as well as additional tax expense of 97 million related to undistributed foreign earnings 

  the year ended december 26 2003 included an aftertax cumulative effect of accounting change benefit of 57 million related to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” 

  net earnings were 339 million or 152 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to 246 million or 111 per share for the prior year 

  the increase in the 2004 effective income tax rate compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to a larger percentage of total pretax earnings in 2004 than in 2003 additionally 2003 income tax expense was favorably impacted by the cumulative impact of changes in the company’s deferred effective state income tax rates 

  in 2004 csx is required to include approximately 10 million shares underlying its convertible debt instrument using the “ifconverted” method in the computation of earnings per share assuming dilution the dilutive impact for all periods is approximately 25 earnings per share assuming dilution has been restated for all periods presented 

 

   operating revenue decreased 350 million for the year ended december 26 2003 to 76 billion compared to 79 billion for the prior year a 627 million decline in consolidated revenue resulted from a reduction of revenue in the domestic containershipping segment as a majority of csx’s interest in csx lines was conveyed during the first quarter of 2003 see note 3 divestitures excluding revenue from this subsidiary revenue increased 277 million primarily due to an increase in surface transportation revenue 

   operating income for the year ended december 26 2003 was down 499 million to 520 million compared to 10 billion in the prior year the prior year included 38 million of operating income of csx lines which was conveyed to a new venture formed with the carlyle group in the first quarter of 2003 excluding operating income from this subsidiary 2003 operating income decreased 461 million 

  the decrease in operating income is primarily the result of two charges taken during 2003 totaling 340 million the company recorded a 232 million charge in conjunction with the change in estimate for casualty reserves which is reflected in operating expense as “provision for casualty claims” see note 11 casualty environmental and other reserves also csx entered into two settlement agreements which together resolved all material outstanding disputes with maersk this decreased the company’s operating income by 108 million and is reflected in operating expense 

22 as the additional loss on sale of international containershipping assets see note 19 commitments and contingencies 

  the company also recorded 34 million pretax as the initial charge for separation expenses related to the management restructuring announced in november 2003 in addition the company recorded a credit of 22 million pretax related to revised estimates for railroad retirement taxes and the amount of benefits that will ultimately be paid to individuals under the 13 billion charges for separation plans initially recorded in 1991 and 1992 for the year the company recorded a net restructuring charge of 22 million see note 5 management restructuring 

  in february 2003 csx conveyed most of its interest in its domestic containershipping subsidiary csx lines llc the consolidated income statement includes operating income of 1 million for the fiscal year ended december 26 2003 derived from csx lines 

   other income increased 15 million to 93 million for the year ended december 26 2003 compared to 78 million for the prior year a decrease in discounts on sales of accounts receivable due to the discontinuance of the receivable sale program and a loss on sale in 2002 that did not recur in 2003 had a favorable impact but were partially offset by lower interest income and reduced real estate gains 

   interest expense decreased 27 million for the year ended december 26 2003 as compared to the prior year lower interest rates on floating rate debt and the favorable impact of interest rate swaps see note 13 derivative financial instruments continued to benefit the company 

   earnings from continuing operations were 137 million or 63 cents per diluted share for the year ended december 26 2003 compared to 410 million or 185 per diluted share for the prior year the 273 million yearoveryear decrease in earnings from continuing operations primarily results from a 145 million aftertax charge to increase the company’s provision for casualty reserves a 67 million aftertax charge to record the loss on sale of international containershipping assets and a 21 million aftertax charge to record amounts associated with the management restructuring 

  earnings from discontinued operations net of tax were 52 million or 23 cents per diluted share for the year ended december 26 2003 compared to earnings of 57 million or 25 cents per diluted share for the prior year 

  the year ended december 26 2003 included an aftertax cumulative effect of accounting change benefit of 57 million related to the adoption of sfas 143 while the year ended december 27 2002 included an aftertax cumulative effect of accounting change charge of 43 million related to the adoption of sfas 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” 

  net earnings were 246 million or 111 per diluted share for the year ended december 26 2003 compared to 424 million or 191 per diluted share for the prior year 

  the 2003 effective income tax rate was lower than the 2002 effective income tax rate because equity in conrail earnings represented a larger percentage of pretax earnings in 2003 than 2002 also 2003 included a favorable state income tax benefit attributable to changes in the company’s deferred effective state income tax rate

rail 

   csx follows a 5253 week fiscal reporting calendar fiscal year 2004 consisted of a 53week year ending on december 31 2004 fiscal year 2003 consisted of 52 weeks ending on december 26 2003 

   csx categorizes revenues in three main areas merchandise automotive and coal coke and iron ore overall revenues were up 512 million to 67 billion in 2004 from 62 billion in 2003 

   merchandise showed strength during 2004 with revenue up 8 on 3 volume growth all markets showed yearoveryear revenue improvement due to pricing yield management strategies and the company’s fuel surcharge program all markets except agricultural products experienced increased volumes metals realized the most improvement with 17 revenue growth on 9 volume growth strong demand existed across all steel commodity lines as steel production and mill utilization rates were at high levels forest products revenue grew 9 on 1 volume growth as a result of strength in panel and lumber markets driven by strong residential construction food and consumer revenues grew 7 on 1 volume growth food and consumer and forest products volumes were favorable yearoveryear primarily due to the 53 week fiscal reporting calendar in 2004 chemicals revenue grew 8 on 4 volume growth driven by strong customer demand and a rebound in us chemical exports emerging markets revenues grew 7 on 6 volume growth largely driven by strength in aggregates cement lime and fly ash new industrial development is helping serve off–rail markets phosphate and fertilizer revenues grew 4 on 2 volume growth fertilizer production levels were mixed as high fertilizer prices and hurricane disruptions caused curtailments in production although ethanol shipments contributed to growth in agricultural products revenue increased 3 on declining volume due to a decline in export and bean markets 

   volumes declined largely due to a 100000 unit yearoveryear decrease in north american light vehicle production downtime at csxtserved plants also contributed to volume weakness price increases drove improvements in revenuepercar 

   coal coke and iron ore revenue increased 11 on 6 volume growth all lines of business reflect yearoveryear revenuepercar improvements volume growth was driven by gains in export metallurgical and utility markets strength in exports was due to high demand primarily related to asia steel market needs 

   other revenue for the fiscal year 2004 includes 63 million for frt a shortline railroad consolidated in 2004 pursuant to financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” prior to 2004 frt was accounted for under the equity method 

   total rail operating expenses increased 212 million or 4 for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to 2003 

  labor and fringe expense increased 143 million or 6 compared to the prior year primarily attributable to the effects of inflation consolidation of frt and increases in the company’s incentive compensation plan and pension costs these costs were partially offset by benefits realized from reduced staffing levels 

  materials supplies and other expenses increased 179 million or 13 yearoveryear primarily due to increased maintenance and crew travel costs property and sales taxes coupled with higher track locomotive car repair and other costs additionally due to the adoption of sfas 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” as discussed below depreciation expense has been decreased and materials supplies and other expense increased to account for the discontinuation of the accrual of crosstie removal as a component of depreciation expense 

26   conrail rents fees  services expense decreased 86 million or 25 in 2004 compared to the prior year as a result of the conrail spinoff transaction which decreased rents paid to conrail as assets previously leased from conrail are now owned directly by csxt see note 2 investment in and integrated rail operations with conrail 

  building and equipment rent remained relatively consistent yearoveryear with the slight increase in 2004 resulting from unfavorable asset utilization 

  inland transportation which represents csxi’s use of the csxt rail network increased 22 million or 6 yearoveryear the offsetting expense associated with this amount is reflected in csxi’s operating expense and thus eliminates at the consolidated level 

  depreciation expense increased 85 million or 15 compared to the prior year primarily attributable to the conrail spinoff transaction the rail segment had property additions of approximately 1 billion but the additional depreciation was offset by the reduction in depreciation associated with the adoption of sfas 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” in conjunction with the grouplife method of accounting for asset costs the company historically accrued crosstie removal costs as a component of depreciation which is not permitted under sfas 143 the effect is to decrease depreciation expense and increase material supplies and other expense 

  fuel expense increased 90 million or 16 in 2004 net of 63 million of fuel hedging benefits compared to the prior year primarily due to fuel price increases while increased volumes were also a factor the average price per gallon of diesel fuel including benefits from csx’s fuel hedging program was 10950 in 2004 versus 09564 in 2003 in addition the fuel surcharge programs and contractual cost escalation clauses used in most multiyear customer contracts partially offset fuel cost increases 

  for the fiscal year ended december 31 2004 the rail business segment recorded expense of 67 million for separation expense pension and postretirement benefit curtailment charges stock compensation expense and other related expenses see note 5 management restructuring 

  rail operating expense for the fiscal year ended december 26 2003 included a charge of 229 million recorded in conjunction with the company’s change in estimate for its casualty reserves to include an estimate of incurred but not reported claims for asbestos and other occupational injuries that could be received over the next seven years this charge is reflected as “provision for casualty claims” in the operating expense detail above see note 11 casualty environmental and other reserves 

   operating income increased 300 million to 841 million in 2004 compared to 541 million in 2003 primarily due to an 8 increase in revenue coupled with the absence of 229 million provision for casualty claims offset by 67 million of management restructuring charges and other expense increases as previously discussed 

 

   overall rail revenues increased 179 million to 62 billion in 2003 with increases in merchandise and automotive revenues 

   merchandise showed strength during 2003 with revenue up 5 on 4 volume growth all markets showed yearoveryear revenue improvement and all except phosphates and fertilizers experienced increased volumes emerging markets realized the most improvement with 18 

27 revenue growth on 12 volume growth aggregates and cement traffic grew faster than average industry growth rates due to new industrial development and increased conversion of truck traffic to rail ammunition volumes increased throughout the year and strength continued in waste markets the metals sector also showed strength in 2003 revenue improved 8 on 9 volume growth driven by strong global steel demand particularly for scrap and sheet steel other factors contributing to improvement include strength in semifinish metals and continued increases in modal conversions demand for building products lumber and paper products resulted in an increase in forest and industrial revenue of 5 on 2 volume growth the agricultural and food and chemical sectors also realized revenue increases while volumes remained consistent with 2002 phosphates and fertilizers revenues increased slightly yearoveryear despite decreased volume due to domestic phosphates and ammonia strength 

   volume declined largely due to a 200000 unit yearoveryear decrease in north american light vehicle production haul extensions and price increases drove improvements in revenuepercar 

   coal coke and iron ore volumes and revenue remained consistent with results in the prior year export moves were strong due to high european steam coal demand for electricity generation steel related traffic was weak throughout the year but showed renewed strength during the fourth quarter due to consolidation in the steel industry and shifts in scrap metal demands that resulted in increased traffic and revenue for csx utility revenue was favorable due to pricing initiatives and higher average length of haul improvements in these areas were offset by abnormally harsh winter weather during the first quarter which adversely affected lake loadings as lakes were frozen 

   total rail operating expenses increased 492 million or 10 in 2003 as compared to 2002 increases in most expense categories were somewhat offset by decreases in building and equipment rent 

  the primary component of the expense increase was a charge of 229 million recorded in conjunction with the company’s change in estimate for its casualty reserves to include an estimate of incurred but not reported claims for asbestos and other occupational injuries that could be received over the next seven years this charge is reflected as “provision for casualty claims” in the operating expense detail above see note 11 casualty environmental and other reserves 

  labor and fringe expense remained relatively consistent yearoveryear the cost of labor inflation was offset by decemberoverdecember reductions in staff of approximately 1200 and the favorable impact of the absence of a management bonus in 2003 as approximately 45 million of such expense was recorded in 2002 

  materials supplies and other expense increased 117 million or 10 yearoveryear one of the primary drivers was approximately 80 million of increased cost for personal injury and related safety issues an additional 20 million of the expense deterioration is due to increased cost of derailments additionally due to the adoption of sfas 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” as discussed below depreciation expense has been decreased and materials supplies and other expense increased to account for the discontinuation of the accrual of crosstie removal as a component of depreciation expense the remaining increase results from volume increases inflationary effects and general operational inefficiencies 

  conrail rents fees  services expense increased 20 million in 2003 as compared to the prior year as a result of increased usage of shared assets areas a contractual increase in the rental fee 

28 for shared area facilities and a favorable tax adjustment in the prior year see note 2 investment in and integrated rail operations with conrail 

  building and equipment rent decreased 7 million in 2003 compared to the prior year principally as a result of reduced car rentals from other railroads 

  inland transportation which represents csxi’s use of the csxt rail network remained relatively consistent yearoveryear the offsetting expense associated with this amount is reflected in csxi’s operating expense and thus eliminates on a surface transportation level 

  depreciation remained consistent yearoveryear the rail segment had capital additions of approximately 1 billion but the additional depreciation was offset by the reduction in depreciation associated with the adoption of sfas 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” in conjunction with the grouplife method of accounting for asset costs the company historically accrued crosstie removal costs as a component of depreciation which is not permitted under sfas 143 the effect is to decrease depreciation expense and increase materials supplies and other expense 

  fuel expense increased 117 million in 2003 as compared to the prior year the expense increase is primarily due to 102 million in fuel price increases while increased volumes were also a factor the average price per gallon of fuel was 96 cents per gallon for 2003 compared to 78 cents per gallon for 2002 in order to minimize future exposure to fuel price fluctuation risk during 2003 the company entered into a series of swaps in order to fix the price of a portion of its estimated future fuel purchases as of december 26 2003 18 and 21 of 2004 and 2005 respectively estimated fuel purchases were hedged fuel swaps did not have an effect on fuel expense for the year ended december 26 2003 

  the net 22 million restructuring charge in 2003 represents the cost of csx’s reorganization charges offset by reductions in 19911992 separation reserves see note 5 management restructuring 

   operating income decreased 313 million to 541 million in 2003 compared to 854 million in 2002 primarily due to the 229 million provision for casualty claims the 22 million net restructuring charge and other expense increases as previously discussed excluding the provision for casualty claims and net restructuring charge operating income would have been 792 million

   csxi revenue improved 5 on a 3 volume increase due to strength in most business commodities strong gains in truck brokerage continued with the implementation of deal space technology which is incorporated into the broader pegasus system deal space technology is designed as a pricing scheduling and capacity reservation system and provides csx trucking solicitors realtime information on costs competitive prices preferred routes and service the parcel and international sectors also continued to show yearoveryear strength the parcel group showed improvement in most markets while international volume gains were based on general import growth the domestic channel did not experience yearoveryear growth due to csxi’s network simplification initiative which led to overall service improvements across the network limited some terminals to containers only and improved the profitability of the traffic 

29   csxi operating expense increased 27 million compared to the prior year due primarily to increases in volume and inflationary factors operating income increased to 152 million in 2004 compared to 110 million in the prior year for a 38 improvement 

   csxi domestic revenue improved 13 on 8 volume increase due to increased unloading and loading “transloading” of international containers into domestic containers and new programs strength in truck brokerage continued due to the rollout of the new pegasus information management system which provides realtime information regarding driver availability and location service quality tracking and financial performance the parcel sector also showed yearoveryear strength international strength in general import growth was partially offset by continued international importexport diversions of freight carried entirely via water routes from west coast ports to east coast ports these diversions have resulted in volume declines shorter hauls and lower perunit revenue 

  csxi operating expense increased 108 million compared to the prior year the increase is due primarily to traffic mix and inflationary factors additionally the company recognized a 15 million positive contract settlement in 2002 operating income decreased to 110 million in 2003 compared to 141 million in the prior year

   as of december 31 2004 csx’s longterm unsecured debt obligations were rated bbb and baa2 by standard and poor’s and moody’s investor service respectively on march 30 2004 standard and poor’s lowered the company’s shortterm rating from a2 to a3 and revised the outlook from stable to negative on july 6 2004 moody’s investor service reaffirmed the company’s short and longterm unsecured debt ratings but adjusted the outlook from stable to negative the company’s shortterm commercial paper program is rated a3 and p2 by standard and poor’s and moody’s investor service respectively this increases the company’s borrowing costs in the commercial paper market and reduces the company’s access to these funds because of the limited demand for a3 commercial paper if csx’s longterm unsecured bond ratings were reduced to bbb and baa3 the company’s undrawn borrowing costs under the 12 billion and 400 million revolving credit facilities would not materially increase 

   csx currently has 900 million of capacity under an effective shelf registration that may be used subject to market conditions and board authorization to issue debt or equity securities at the company’s discretion the company presently intends to use the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under its shelf registration statement to finance cash requirements including refinancing existing debt as it matures while the company seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to meeting such needs there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit the company to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time or at all

critical accounting estimates 

  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results may differ from those estimates significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas 

   these estimates and assumptions are discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors on a regular basis 

casualty environmental and legal reserves 

   casualty reserves represent accruals for the uninsured portion of personal injury and occupational injury claims 

   in 2003 csx retained an independent actuarial firm to assist management in assessing the value of csx’s personal injury portfolio an analysis is performed by the independent actuarial firm semiannually the methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth in the value of the company’s personal injury claims this methodology is based largely on csx’s historical claims and settlement activity actual results may vary from estimates due to the type and severity of the injury costs of medical treatments and uncertainties surrounding the litigation process in conjunction with the change in estimate during the third quarter of 2003 the company recorded a charge of 26 million for personal injury liabilities reserves for personal injury claims are 383 million and 355 million at december 31 2004 and december 26 2003 respectively 

  while the final outcome of casualtyrelated matters cannot be predicted with certainty considering among other things the meritorious legal defenses available and liabilities that have been recorded it is the opinion of csx management that none of these items when finally resolved will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position or liquidity however should a number of these items occur in the same period it could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year 

   occupational claims include allegations of exposure to certain materials in the work place such as asbestos solvents and diesel fuel or alleged physical injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome or hearing loss 

   the company is party to a number of occupational claims by employees exposed to asbestos in the workplace the heaviest exposure for csx employees was due to work conducted in and around the use of steam locomotive engines that were phased out between the early 1950’s and late 1960’s however other types of exposures including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials continued after 1967 until it was substantially eliminated by 1985 

34   asbestos claim filings against the company have been inconsistent accordingly while the company had concluded that a probable loss had occurred it did not believe it could estimate the range of reasonably possible loss because of the lack of experience with such claims and the lack of detailed employment records for the population of exposed employees claim filings increased and when they continued into 2003 the company concluded that an estimate for incurred but not reported asbestos exposure liability needed to be recorded 

  in 2003 csx engaged a third party who has extensive experience in performing asbestos and other occupational studies to assist in assessing the unasserted liability exposure the objective of the assessment was to determine the number of estimated incurred but not reported asbestos claims and the estimated average cost per claim to be received over the next seven years seven years was determined by management to be the time period in which claim filings and claim values could be estimated with more certainty 

  the company with the assistance of the third party first determined its exposed population from which it was able to derive the estimated number of incurred but not reported claims the estimated average cost per claim was then determined utilizing recent actual average cost per claim data based on the assessment in september 2003 the company recorded an undiscounted 141 million pretax charge for unasserted asbestos claims key elements of the assessment included the following 

   from these assumptions csx projected the incidence of each type of disease to the estimated population to arrive at an estimate of the total number of employees that could potentially assert a claim historical claim filing rates were applied for each type of disease to the total number of employees that could potentially assert a claim to determine the total number of anticipated claim filings by disease type historical dismissal rates which represent claims that are closed without payment were deducted to calculate the number of future claims by disease type that would likely require payment by the company finally the number of such claims was multiplied by the average settlement value to estimate csx’s future liability for incurred but not reported asbestos claims 

  the estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for this reserve asbestos claim filings are typically sporadic and may include large batches of claims solicited by law firms to reflect these factors csx used a twoyear calibration period during its initial assessment because the company believed it would be most representative of its future claim experience in addition for nonmalignant claims the number of future claims to be filed against csx declines at a rate consistent with both mortality and age as there is a decreasing probability of filing claims as the population ages csx believes the average claim values 

35 by type of disease from the historical period 20012002 are most representative of future claim values nonmalignant claims which represent approximately 90 of the total number and 91 of the cost of estimated future asbestos claims were valued by age of the projected claimants historically the ultimate settlement value of these types of claims is most sensitive to the age of the claimant a 10 increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of incurred but not reported claims or the average claim values would result in an approximate 14 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted asbestos claims 

  in the fourth quarter of 2004 management updated their assessment of the unasserted liability exposure with the assistance of the third party specialists in 2004 individual asbestos claims continued to be sporadic and proved to be submitted at a low rate for the year in further review of the data the bulk claims filed by the law firms appear to be filed against the company every other year as a result management reassessed the calibration period to a 4year average 20002004 to capture the most recent filing experience within the context of the bulk law firm filings 

  csx will obtain semiannual updates of the study on a quarterly basis csx will monitor actual experience against the number of forecasted claims to be received and expected claim payments adjustments to our estimates will be recorded quarterly if necessary more periodic updates to the study will occur if trends necessitate a change at december 31 2004 the company had recorded undiscounted liabilities of 212 million for asbestosrelated claims of the amount recorded 132 million is related to incurred but not reported claims while 80 million is related to asserted claims as of december 26 2003 the company had recorded undiscounted liabilities of 246 for asbestosrelated claims current liabilities include 37 million and 20 million of asbestosrelated claims as of december 31 2004 and december 26 2003 respectively defense and processing costs which historically have been and are anticipated in the future to be insignificant are not included in the recorded liability the company is presently selfinsured for asbestosrelated claims 

   in the third quarter of 2003 the company changed its estimate of occupational reserves to include an estimate of incurred but not reported claims for other occupational injuries as well as asbestos as noted above the company engaged a third party specialist to assist in projecting the number of other occupational injury claims to be received over the next seven years and the related costs based on this analysis the company established reserves for the probable and reasonably estimable other occupational injury liabilities in the third quarter of 2003 the company recorded an undiscounted 65 million pretax charge for incurred but not reported other occupational claims for similar reasons as asbestos discussed above similar to the asbestos liability estimation process the key elements of the assessment included the following 

 36   at december 31 2004 the company had recorded undiscounted liabilities of 110 million for other occupationalrelated claims of the amount recorded 56 million is related to incurred but not reported claims while 54 million is related to asserted claims as of december 26 2003 the company had recorded undiscounted liabilities of 111 million for other occupationalrelated claims current liabilities include 18 million and 4 million at december 31 2004 and december 26 2003 respectively defense and processing costs which historically have been and are anticipated in the future to be insignificant are not included in the recorded liability the company is presently selfinsured for other occupationalrelated claims 

  the amounts recorded by csx for the occupational liability were based upon currently known facts projecting future events such as the number of new claims to be filed each year the average cost of disposing of claims as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding asbestos and other occupational litigation in the united states could cause the actual costs to be higher or lower than projected 

   csxt is a party to various proceedings including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies related to environmental issues csxt has been identified as a potentially responsible party “prp” at approximately 252 environmentally impaired sites many of which are or may be subject to remedial action under the federal superfund statute “superfund” or similar state statutes a number of these proceedings are based on allegations that csxt or its railroad predecessors sent hazardous substances to the facilities in question for disposal some of the proceedings involve property formerly or currently owned by csxt or its railroad predecessors proceedings arising under superfund or similar state statutes can involve numerous other companies who generated the waste or owned or operated the property and involve the allocation of liability for costs associated with site investigation and cleanup which could be substantial 

  at least once each quarter csxt reviews its role with respect to each such location giving consideration to a number of factors including 

   csxt management estimates its environmental liabilities using guidance from statement of position 961 environmental remediation liabilities each site is periodically evaluated and the liability is adjusted to the most recent estimates made by management based on this review process csxt has recorded reserves to cover estimated contingent future environmental costs with respect to such sites these liabilities which are undiscounted include amounts representing csxt’s estimate of unasserted claims which csxt believes to be immaterial the liability includes future costs for all sites where the company’s obligation is 1 deemed probable and 2 can be reasonably estimated the liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs but excludes any anticipated insurance recoveries 

  the company does not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities if any on some sites until completion of future environmental studies also changes in federal and state laws and regulations may impact favorably or unfavora 

37 bly the effort required to remediate sites in addition latent conditions at any given location could result in exposure the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reliably estimated based upon information currently available however the company believes its environmental reserves are adequate to accomplish remedial actions to comply with present laws and regulations and that the ultimate liability for these matters if any will not materially affect its overall results of operations and financial condition 

   in accordance with sfas 5 “accounting for contingencies” an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is 1 probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and 2 the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated if no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred 

  the company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities twice quarterly and records and adjusts reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above the amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings newly discovered or developed evidence or changes in laws regulations and evidentiary standards 

pension and postretirement medical plan accounting 

  the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried noncontract personnel the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement in addition to the defined benefit pension plans the company sponsors one medical plan and one life insurance plan that provide benefits to fulltime salaried noncontract employees hired prior to january 1 2003 upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met the postretirement medical plans are contributory partially funded by retirees with retiree contributions adjusted annually the life insurance plan is noncontributory 

  the accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in sfas no 87 “employers accounting for pensions” and sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” both of these statements require that management make certain assumptions relating to the following 

   these assumptions are determined as of the beginning of the year as permitted by sfas 87 the company has elected to use a plan fiscal year of october 1 through september 30 to actuarially value its pension and postretirement plans as it provides for more timely analysis the company engages independent external actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the company selects as of the beginning of the plan year the company reviews the discount salary scale inflation and health care cost trend rates on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends as appropriate since the company negatively adjusted its expected longterm rate of return on assets in both 2004 and 2005 management does not anticipate revisiting this rate for the next 3 to 5 years to maintain consistency with market cycles 

   the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation in estimating that rate the company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the fund and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is used in conjunction with the marketrelated value of assets to compute the expected return on assets 

  the company’s expected longterm average rate of return on assets considers the current and projected asset mix of the funds management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected longterm rate of return on assets as this assumption is longterm it is adjusted less frequently than other assumptions used in pension accounting however recent overall market returns have caused csx to reevaluate and reduce the rate used in calculating its liability at september 30 2004 consequently increasing the amount of pension expense reported in future periods 

   discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component of pension and postretirement expense assumed discount rates reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled it is appropriate in estimating those rates to look to available information about rates implicit in current prices of annuity contracts that could be used to effect settlement of the obligation in making those estimates employers may also look to rates of return on highquality fixedincome investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits each year those rates are reevaluated to determine whether they reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates if interest rates generally decline or rise the assumed discount rates will change 

  the company derives its discount rates from composite yields of aarated bonds adjusted for estimated durations the difference between the discount rate used for pension and that used for postretirement is due to the different time horizon of future payments consequently management has minimal discretion with respect to the discount rates selected 

   salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the company the company reviews recent merit increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in assessment of salary scale inflation rates 

   health care cost trend rates are based on recent plan experience and industry trends the company uses actuarial data to substantiate the inflation assumption for health care costs representing increases in total plan costs which include claims and administrative fee cost components the current assumed health care cost trend rate is 11 and is expected to increase slightly before decreasing gradually until reaching 45 in 2013 no changes were deemed necessary to the health care costs trend rate for the years 2003 or 2004 due to the increasing costs of providing health benefits the company expects to increase the inflation assumption for health care costs for 2005 

   the calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to mortality rates turnover and retirement age these assumptions are based on historical data and are approved by management 

   as a result of changes in assumptions for fiscal year 2005 net periodic pension benefit cost and postretirement benefit costs for 2005 are expected to be approximately 47 million and 40 million respectively it is not likely that an event will occur in 2005 to cause the company to adjust the discount rate or salary scale inflation rate in excess of 025 

 

   the company is required to estimate and record the effects of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 “act” the company believes that a portion of its medical plan’s prescription drug benefit will qualify as actuarially equivalent to medicare part d based upon a review by the plan’s health and welfare actuary of the plan’s prescription drug benefit compared with the prescription drug benefit that would be paid under medicare part d beginning in 2006 the reduction in the postretirement benefit obligation as a result of the act was approximately 25 million there was no immediate impact on net earnings as an unrecognized gain will be recorded the effects of the act are reflected in net postretirement benefit costs as the unrecognized gain is amortized which began in the second quarter of 2004 postretirement benefit costs were reduced by approximately 3 million in 2004 due to the act see note 18 employee benefit plans 

depreciation policies for assets under the grouplife method 

  the company accounts for its rail assets including mainline track locomotives and freight cars using the grouplife method the grouplife method pools similar assets by type and then depreciates each group as a whole under the grouplife method the service lives for each group of rail assets are determined by the performance of periodic life studies and management’s assumptions concerning the service lives of its properties these studies are conducted by a third party expert analyzed by the company’s management and approved by the stb 

  changes in asset lives due to the results of the life studies could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense and thus the company’s results of operations events that could cause the company to change its estimates relating to the lives of its asset groups could be 

40 changes in historical results technological improvements maintenance plans and changes in specific assets the life studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by the study any such deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining useful life of the asset group until the next required life study 

  although recent experience with life studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes these modifications have not significantly affected the company’s annual depreciation expense in 2003 the company completed life studies for all of its rail equipment and track assets resulting in an increase in the average useful lives of equipment and track assets while decreasing the average useful lives of many roadway assets the combination of these adjustments increased depreciation expense by 1 million in 2003 with a decrease of approximately 13 million in 2004 life studies for equipment assets are completed every three years whereas road and track life studies are completed every six years as required by the stb 

  assets depreciated under the grouplife method comprise 95 of the company’s total fixed assets and amounted to 193 billion on a net basis at december 31 2004 the company’s depreciation expense for the year ended december 31 2004 amounted to 711 million a onepercentage point increase or decrease in the average life of all grouplife assets would result in a 7 million increase or decrease to the company’s annual depreciation expense 

income taxes 

  management uses factors such as applicable law current information and past experience with similar issues in computing its income tax expense the company has not materially changed its methodology for calculating income tax expense for the years presented the company does not anticipate any material change in the methodology or assumptions used in determining the company’s income tax expense 

  the company files a consolidated federal income tax return which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries examinations of the federal income tax returns of csx have been completed through 1993 federal income tax returns for 1994 through 2003 currently are under examination management believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed while the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty it is the opinion of csx management that none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial position or liquidity of csx however an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year the company is party to a number of legal and administrative proceedings the resolution of which could result in gain realization in amounts that could be material to results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year

executive summary 

2004 surface transportation highlights and challenges 

revenue 

  revenue increased by 8 or 581 million yearoveryear a portion of which is due to 53 weeks instead of 52 weeks in the fiscal year ended december 31 2004 the fourth quarter of 2004 marked the 11th consecutive quarter of yearoveryear revenue growth increased demand for coal was a primary driver of the revenue growth due to both increased electricity generation and rebuilding utility stockpile inventory in addition demand created from a generally strong industrial economy propelled all merchandise markets and csxi to record revenue levels all major markets showed yearoveryear improvement in revenuepercar due to continued yield management strategies and the company’s fuel surcharge program 

volume 

  volume growth during 2004 lagged others in the rail industry due to service related constraints at csxt and the network simplification initiative “nsi” at csxi several markets exhibited potential for additional volume especially within the coal and metals markets if the company’s car fleet utilization had improved furthermore some customers diverted traffic to other rail carriers or other modes of transportation due to service challenges 

  in july csxi implemented nsi which eliminated 26 weekly train starts in an effort to improve overall contributions by consolidating volumes on fewer trains the annualized impact from nsi is estimated to be increase csxi’s operating income by 8 million or approximately 5 

fuel costs and fuel surcharge program 

  fuel expenses increased 16 to 656 million in 2004 net of 63 million of fuel hedging benefits from 566 million in 2003 due principally to the rising price per gallon of diesel fuel fuel hedging activity had no impact on fuel expense for the fiscal year ended december 26 2003 the average price per gallon of diesel fuel including benefits from csx’s fuel hedging program was 10950 in 2004 versus 09564 in 2003 in addition the fuel surcharge programs within the surface transportation business segment and contractual cost escalation clauses used in most multiyear customer contracts partially offset fuel cost increases 

operations 

  fiscal year 2004 proved to be operationally challenging as illustrated in the table below key measures of network performance declined versus prior year and had an adverse impact on service 

11 consistency expenses and csx’s ability to fully capture growth opportunities during a period of high demand for transportation services

a amounts for 2004 are estimated 

implementation of the one plan 

  the one plan was a major initiative launched across the csx network in the third quarter of 2004 aimed at improving network performance the first phase of the one plan included a complete redesign of the operating plan for automotive and merchandise shipments to improve service consistency and efficiency by reducing terminal handlings and routing miles with the new operating plan in place management focused on consistent execution and refining the plan in response to changing shipment volumes and flows early results were promising with key measures improving sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter of 2004 

expenses 

  csx follows a 5253 week fiscal reporting calendar fiscal year 2004 consisted of a 53week year ending on december 31 2004 fiscal year 2003 consisted of 52 weeks ending on december 26 2003 

 12 safety 

  efforts by the company to reduce the frequency of personal injuries and train accidents produced modest improvements on a yearoveryear comparison the company’s personal injury frequency index for 2004 remained unchanged from 2003 levels while its fra train accident frequency improved 4 on a yearoveryear basis the company’s safety performance improved sequentially in the third and fourth quarters

organizational effectiveness initiative 

  as of april 2004 csx concluded the management restructuring program announced in november 2003 to improve the speed of decisionmaking by reducing management layers and increasing the span of control for managers as well as realigning certain functions as a result of this initiative csx reduced the nonunion surface transportation workforce by 863 positions the company incurred expense associated with this program through the third quarter of 2004 as final settlement costs were determined 

13 selected earnings data 

 14 free cash flow 

  free cash flow is considered a nongaap financial measure under sec regulation g management believes however that free cash flow is important in evaluating its financial performance and measures an ability to generate cash without incurring additional external financings free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than a substitute for cash provided by operating activities the following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities gaap measure to free cash flow nongaap measure 

   surface transportation capital expenditures totaled 960 million and 983 million for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 respectively 

international terminals divestiture 

  on february 22 2005 csx sold its international terminals business through the sale of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of slsi and all of its interest in orange blossom investment company ltd to dpi for closing cash consideration of 1142 billion subject to final working capital and longterm debt adjustments as a result of the sale csx will recognize a significant gain in the first quarter of 2005 and expects to tender substantial tax payments triggered by the transaction beginning in the second quarter of 2005 as a result amounts related to this business are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented on the consolidated income statement discontinued operations includes international terminals’ net earnings of 18 million as well as additional tax expense of 97 million related to undistributed foreign earnings on the consolidated balance sheet the amounts related to this business are shown as international terminals assetsliabilities held for sale 

conrail spinoff 

  in the third quarter of 2004 csx norfolk southern corporation and conrail inc completed a corporate reorganization of conrail that resulted in the direct ownership and control by csxt of routes and assets that had previously been operated by csxt under operating and lease agreements with a conrail subsidiary as a part of the reorganization csxt issued new unsecured debt obligations which were exchanged for unsecured debt obligations of consolidated rail corporation “crc” a conrail subsidiary in addition csxt entered into new lease and sublease arrangements with crc to support crc’s secured debt and lease obligations and a longterm note due from csx to conrail was eliminated the reorganization did not affect the shared assets areas which continue to be owned and operated by crc and are reflected in csx’s investment in conrail as shown in the consolidated balance sheets 

  the distribution was accounted for at fair value resulting in a net gain of 16 million after tax which is included in other income in the consolidated income statement 

15   the assets and liabilities acquired at the time of the conrail spinoff transaction as of september 2004 are as follows 

 horizon lines 

  in july 2004 csx received 59 million which included 48 million for the purchase of its ownership interest in horizon 4 million of interest and a performance payment of 7 million which will be recognized over 12 years however csx and one of its affiliates will continue to remain a lessee sublessor or guarantor on 265 million of leases on certain vessels and equipment as long as the subleases remain in effect 

2005 expectations 

revenue 

  revenue is expected to continue to outpace volume in 2005 due to a continued emphasis on price lower contributory traffic is either being repriced or replaced by longer haul more profitable business the amount of any revenue and volume increase depends on several factors 

 operations 

  improvement in key operating measurements is expected in 2005 several factors can affect overall service levels 

 16  capital investments 

  total capital investments in rail infrastructure locomotives and freight cars are estimated to be 11 billion in 2005 capital expenditures could increase if the industrial economy remains strong additional volume materializes and profitability targets including free cash flow are met 

free cash flow
