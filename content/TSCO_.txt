competition 

we operate in a competitive retail industry we believe the principal competitive factors include location of stores fulfillment options price quality of merchandise instock inventory consistency merchandise assortment and presentation product knowledge and customer service we compete with general merchandise retailers home center retailers pet retailers specialty and discount retailers independently owned retail farm and ranch stores numerous privatelyheld regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives as well as internetbased retailers however we believe we successfully differentiate ourselves from many of these retailers by focusing on our specialized market niche for customers living the rural lifestyle see further discussion of competition in 1a “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10k 

seasonality and weather 

our business is seasonal historically our sales and profits are the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products we usually experience our highest inventory and accounts payable balances during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal products to support the higher sales volume of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter to support the higher sales volume of the coldweather selling season we believe that our business can be more accurately assessed by focusing on the performance of the halves not the quarters due to the fact that different weather patterns from yeartoyear can shift the timing of sales and profits between quarters particularly between the first and second fiscal quarters and the third and fourth fiscal quarters 

historically weather conditions including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and unseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months have unfavorably affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations in addition extreme weather conditions including snow and ice storms flood and wind damage hurricanes tornadoes extreme rain and droughts have impacted operating results both negatively and positively depending on the severity and length of these conditions our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends 

stewardship and compliance with environmental matters 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment we are committed to complying with all applicable environmental laws and regulations we are also committed to becoming a more environmentally sustainable company this commitment is demonstrated through our stewardship program which is our environmental sustainability program through this program the company has implemented a number of initiatives designed to reduce our impact on the environment these initiatives include the installation of energy management systems led lighting high efficiency heatingair conditioning systems and recycling programs in our stores distribution facilities and store support center our store support center and our distribution centers in casa grande arizona and frankfort new york are leed leadership in energy and environmental design silver certified for environmentally sustainable design construction and operation we also installed solar arrays at the store support center in brentwood tennessee and our tractor supply store in hendersonville tennessee

in december 2018 we announced a goal to reduce carbon emissions from our facilities by 25 by 2025 from our 2015 baseline as part of the companys stewardship program in december 2020 we announced that we had reached this goal five years early

 item 1a  risk factors 

our business faces many risks certain risks of which we are currently aware and deem to be material are described below if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur our business financial condition or results of operations may significantly suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this form 10k 

strategic and competitive risks 

failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name or any of our exclusive brands 

our success depends in part on the value and strength of the tractor supply name including our exclusive brands the tractor supply name is integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business maintaining promoting and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide high quality merchandise and a consistent high quality customer experience our brand could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity whether or not based on fact any failure to comply or accusation of our failure to comply with ethical social product labor data privacy and environmental standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions customers are also increasingly using social media to provide feedback and information about our company including our products and services in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated further adverse publicity about our merchandise products whether valid or not may discourage consumers from buying the products we offer additionally our proprietary rights in our trademarks trade names service marks domain names copyrights patents trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are valuable assets of our business we may not be able to prevent or even discover every instance of unauthorized third party uses of our intellectual property or dilution of our brand names such as when a third party uses trademarks that are identical or similar to our own any of these events could result in decreased revenue or otherwise adversely affect our business 

we may be unable to increase sales at our existing stores 

we experience fluctuations in our comparable store sales at our existing stores defined as sales in stores which have been open for at least twelve months see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a further discussion of comparable store sales various factors affect the comparable store sales at our existing stores including among others the general retail sales environment our ability to efficiently source and distribute products global supply chain disruptions changes in our merchandise assortment competition proximity of our locations to one another or to the locations of other competing retailers increased presence of online retailers current economic conditions customer satisfaction with our products retail pricing the timing of promotional events the release of new merchandise the success of marketing programs weather conditions and our ability to attract and retain qualified team members these factors may cause the comparable store sales results at our existing stores to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations past comparable store sales are not an indication of future results and there can be no assurance that our comparable store sales will not decrease in the future 

furthermore the significant positive impact of the covid19 pandemic on the demand for our products in fiscal 2021 and 2020 resulted in a significant increase in new or reacquired customers and in comparable store sales growth our sales performance in fiscal 2021 and 2020 may present a greater risk to our ability to increase comparable store sales in the following years and in our ability to maintain our new or reacquired customers gained in those years therefore we may not be able to sustain or increase our comparable store sales in fiscal 2022 and beyond 

failure to open and manage new stores in the number and manner currently contemplated could adversely affect our financial performance 

an integral part of our business strategy includes the expansion of our store base through new store openings this expansion strategy is dependent on our ability to find suitable locations and we face competition from many retailers and other businesses for such sites if we are unable to implement this strategy our ability to increase our sales profitability and cash flow could be impaired significantly to the extent that we are unable to open new stores in the manner we anticipate due to among other reasons site approval or unforeseen delays in construction our sales growth may be impeded 

although we have a rigorous real estate site selection and approval process there can be no assurance that our new store openings will be successful or result in incremental sales and profitability for the company new stores build their sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection over time and as a result generally have lower gross margins and higher 

operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our more mature stores as we continue to open new stores there may be a negative impact on our results from a lower contribution margin of these new stores until their sales levels ramp to chain average if at all as well as from the impact of related preopening costs additionally new stores can also impact the sales and contribution margins of existing stores located in close proximity 

as we execute this expansion strategy we may also experience managerial or operational challenges which may prevent any expected increase in sales profitability or cash flow our ability to manage our planned expansion depends on the adequacy of our existing information systems the efficiency and expansion of our distribution systems the adequacy of the hiring and training process for new personnel especially store managers the effectiveness of our controls and procedures and the ability to identify customer demand and build market awareness in different geographic areas there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our planned expansion that the new stores will be effectively integrated into our existing operations or that such stores will be profitable 

our merchandising and marketing initiatives may not provide expected results 

we believe our past performance has been based on and future success will depend in part upon the ability to develop and execute merchandising initiatives with effective marketing programs these merchandising initiatives and marketing programs may not deliver expected results and there is no assurance that we will correctly identify and respond in a timely manner to evolving trends and consumer preferences and expectations if we misjudge the market or our marketing programs are not successful we may overstock unpopular products and be forced to take inventory impairment or retail price reductions that have a material adverse effect on our profitability failure to execute and promote such initiatives in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow the business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition shortages of key merchandise could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

competition may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations 

we operate in the highly competitive retail merchandise sector with numerous competitors these competitors include general merchandise retailers home center retailers pet retailers specialty and discount retailers independentlyowned retail farm and ranch stores numerous privatelyheld regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives as well as internetbased retailers we compete for customers merchandise real estate locations and employees this competitive environment subjects us to various other risks including the inability to continue our store and sales growth and to provide attractive merchandise to our customers at competitive prices that allow us to maintain our profitability our failure to compete effectively in this environment could adversely impact our financial performance 

we may pursue strategic acquisitions and the failure of an acquisition to produce the anticipated results or the inability to fully integrate the acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business 

we may from time to time acquire businesses we believe to be complementary to our business for example the pending acquisition of orscheln farm and home llc discussed previously the success of an acquisition is based on our ability to make accurate assumptions regarding the valuation operations growth potential integration and other factors relating to the target business acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and may result in the diversion of our capital and our management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities we may not be able to successfully integrate an organization that we acquire including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures if we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions we could experience increased costs associated with operating inefficiencies which could have an adverse effect on our financial results also while we employ several different methodologies to assess potential business opportunities acquired businesses may not achieve desired profitability objectives or other expectations causing lower than expected earnings and cash flows which could adversely affect our financial performance and subsequently require impairment of longlived assets goodwill and other intangible assets 

weather and climate risks 

unseasonal and extreme weather may have a significant impact on our financial results 

weather conditions affect the demand for and in some cases the supply of products which in turn has an impact on prices historically weather conditions including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and unseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months have affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations in addition extreme weather conditions such as more frequent or intense hurricanes thunderstorms tornadoes flood fires 

droughts and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels have impacted operating results both positively and negatively and may positively or negatively impact our business in the future while extreme weather conditions can positively impact our operating results by increasing demand in affected locations for products needed to cope with the weather condition and its effects they can also negatively affect our business depending on the severity and length of these conditions as a result of store closings damage to our stores or merchandise or the inability of customers to shop at our stores due to weather conditions our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends should such a strategy not be effective the weather may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

weather conditions may cause a disruption in our distribution and transportation network that would adversely affect our ability to conduct our operations 

we rely on our distribution and transportation network including thirdparty logistics providers to provide goods to our stores and to our customers in a timely and costeffective manner through deliveries to our distribution facilities from vendors and then from the distribution facilities or direct ship vendors to our stores or customers by various means of transportation including shipments by sea air rail and truck although we believe that our operations are efficient disruptions due to extreme weather conditions including snow and ice storms flood and wind damage hurricanes tornadoes extreme rain fires and droughts may result in delays in the transportation and delivery of merchandise to our distribution centers our stores or our customers significant disruptions or delays in our distribution and transportation network could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our customers which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we may be adversely affected by legal regulatory or market responses to global climate change 

growing concern over climate change has led policy makers in the us to consider the enactment of legislative and regulatory proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on greenhouse gas emissions such laws if enacted are likely to impact our business in a number of ways for example we use natural gas diesel fuel gasoline and electricity in conducting our operations increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may result in increased compliance costs and legislation or regulation affecting energy inputs which could materially affect our profitability compliance with any new or more stringent laws or requirements or stricter interpretations of existing laws could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers our inability to appropriately respond to such changes could adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

macroeconomic risks 

general economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance 

our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending including discretionary spending a weakening of economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as lower employment levels uncertainty or changes in business or political conditions social and political causes and movements higher interest rates higher tax rates higher fuel and energy costs higher labor and healthcare costs the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism general health epidemics and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to competitors a general reduction in the level of discretionary spending shifts in consumer discretionary spending to our competitors or shifts in discretionary spending to less profitable products sold by us could result in lower net sales slower inventory turnover greater markdowns on inventory and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins 

purchase price volatility including inflationary and deflationary pressures may adversely affect our financial performance 

although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items grain corn steel petroleum cotton and other commodities as well as duties tariffs diesel fuel and transportation services therefore we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost which may impact consumer demand and as a result sales and gross margin our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale from increased volume of purchases adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors while maintaining product quality should our strategy to mitigate purchase price volatility not be effective our financial performance could be adversely impacted 

team member risks 

our failure to attract and retain qualified team members increases in wage and labor costs and changes in laws and other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to maintain and continue expanding operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified team members our ability to meet labor needs while controlling wage and related labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force unemployment levels prevailing wage rates increases in legally required minimum wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs changes in employment legislation and the potential for changes in local labor practices or union activities if we are unable to locate attract or retain qualified personnel or if costs of labor or related costs increase significantly our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we are subject to federal state and local laws governing employment practices and working conditions these laws cover wage and hour practices labor relations paid and family leave workplace safety and immigration among others the laws and regulations being passed at the state and local level create unique challenges for a multistate employer we must continue to monitor and adapt our employment practices to comply with these various laws and regulations if our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly as new or revised labor laws rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented our financial performance could be adversely affected 

the loss of current members of our senior management team and other key team members or the failure to successfully manage an executive officer transition may adversely affect our operating results 

our success depends in large part on the continued availability and service of our executive officers senior management and other key team members competition for senior management and key team members in our industry is strong and we may not be able to retain our key team members or attract new qualified team members we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other team members sufficiently both to maintain our current business and to execute our longterm strategic growth initiatives the loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management without sufficient advance notice could prevent or delay the implementation and completion of our strategic initiatives or divert management’s attention to seeking qualified replacements additionally any failure by us to manage a successful leadership transition of an executive officer and to timely identify a qualified permanent replacement could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

supply chain and thirdparty vendor risks 

we face risks associated with vendors from whom our products are sourced 

the products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors we have agreements with our vendors in which the vendors agree to comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and to indemnify us against certain liabilities and costs our ability to recover liabilities and costs under these vendor agreements is dependent upon the financial condition and integrity of the vendors we rely on longterm relationships with our suppliers but have no significant longterm contracts with such suppliers our future success will depend in large measure upon our ability to maintain our existing supplier relationships or to develop new ones this reliance exposes us to the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various products due to political economic social health including but not limited to the covid19 coronavirus or environmental conditions transportation delays or changes in laws and regulations affecting distribution our vendors may be forced to reduce their production shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection which could make it difficult for us to serve the market’s needs and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

while the company selects these thirdparty vendors carefully it does not control their actions or the components or manufacture of their products any problems caused by these thirdparties or issues associated with their products or workforce including customer or governmental complaints breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes and cyber attacks or security breaches at a vendor could subject the company to litigation and adversely affect the company’s ability to deliver products and services to its customers and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on foreign manufacturers for various products that we sell in addition many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources as an importer our business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business internationally such as domestic and foreign governmental regulations economic disruptions global or regional 

health epidemics delays in shipments transportation capacity and costs currency exchange rates and changes in political or economic conditions in countries from which we purchase products if any such factors were to render the conduct of business in particular countries undesirable or impractical or if additional us quotas duties tariffs taxes or other charges or restrictions were imposed upon the importation of our products in the future our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

the political landscape in the us contains uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies tariffs and regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries we source a portion of our merchandise from manufacturers located outside the us primarily in asia and central america major developments in tax policy or trade relations such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise or the imposition of tariffs on imported products could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on manufacturers located in foreign countries including china for merchandise additionally a portion of our domestically purchased merchandise is manufactured abroad our business may be materially adversely affected by risks associated with international trade including the impact of current or potential tariffs by the us with respect to certain consumer goods imported from china 

we source a portion of our merchandise from manufacturers located outside the us primarily in asia and central america and many of our domestic vendors have a global supply chain the us has imposed tariffs on certain products imported into the us from china and could propose additional tariffs the imposition of tariffs on imported products has increased our costs and could result in reduced sales and profits the changes in certain tax and trade policies tariffs and other regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries enacted under the prior us administration increased the cost of our merchandise sourced from outside of the us which represents a large percentage of our overall merchandise it remains unclear how tax or trade policies tariffs or trade relations may change under the current us administration which could adversely affect our business results of operations effective income tax rate liquidity and net income 

in addition the imposition of tariffs by the us has resulted in the adoption of tariffs by china on us exports and could result in the adoption of tariffs by other countries as well a resulting trade war could have a significant adverse effect on world trade and the world economy further the imposition of tariffs or other changes in world trade could have an impact on certain us industries and consumers and could negatively impact the consumer demand for products that we sell 

we continue to evaluate the impact of the effective and potential tariffs on our supply chain costs sales and profitability as well as our strategies to mitigate any negative impact including negotiating with our vendors seeking alternative sourcing options and adjusting retail selling prices given the uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of the current and potential tariffs as well as the potential for additional trade actions by the us or other countries the impact on our business results of operations and financial condition is uncertain but could be significant thus we can provide no assurance that any strategies we implement to mitigate the impact of such tariffs or other trade actions will be successful in whole or in part to the extent that our supply chain costs sales or profitability are negatively affected by the tariffs or other trade actions our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

a significant disruption to our distribution network or to the timely receipt of inventory could adversely impact sales or increase our transportation costs which would decrease our profits 

we rely on our distribution and transportation network including thirdparty logistics providers to provide goods to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner through deliveries to our distribution facilities from vendors and then from the distribution facilities or direct ship vendors to our stores or customers by various means of transportation including shipments by sea air rail and truck any disruption unanticipated expense or operational failure related to this process could negatively affect our operations for example unexpected delivery delays including delays due to weather fuel shortages work stoppages global or regional health epidemics product shortages from vendors or other reasons or increases in transportation costs including increased fuel costs or a decrease in transportation capacity for overseas shipments could significantly decrease our ability to provide adequate products to meet increased customer demand for certain products or products at a desired price resulting in lower sales and profitability in addition labor shortages or work stoppages in the transportation industry or longterm disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries could negatively affect our business also a fire tornado or other disaster at one of our distribution facilities could disrupt our timely receiving processing and shipment of merchandise to our stores which could adversely affect our business while we believe there are adequate reserve quantities and alternative suppliers available shortages or interruptions in the receipt or supply of products caused by unanticipated demand such as occurred during and as the economy recovers from the covid19 pandemic problems in production or distribution financial or other difficulties of supplies 

inclement weather or other economic conditions including the availability of qualified drivers and distribution center team members could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of products and our operating results 

the implementation of our supply chain initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail 

we maintain a network of distribution facilities and have plans to build new distribution facilities and expand existing facilities to support our longterm strategic growth initiatives delays in opening new or expanded distribution facilities could adversely affect our future operations by slowing store growth or negatively impacting our fulfillment capabilities which may in turn reduce revenue growth in addition distributionrelated construction or expansion projects entail risks which could cause delays and cost overruns such as shortages of materials shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages unforeseen construction scheduling engineering environmental or geological problems weather interference fires or other casualty losses and unanticipated cost increases the completion date and ultimate cost of future projects could differ significantly from initial expectations due to constructionrelated or other reasons we cannot guarantee that all projects will be completed on time or within established budgets 

we continue to make significant technology investments in our supply chain these initiatives are designed to streamline our distribution process so that we can optimize the delivery of goods and services to our stores distribution facilities and customers in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives including those associated with managing thirdparty service providers and employing new webbased tools and services could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term in addition our improved supply chain technology might not provide the anticipated benefits it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the initiatives might fail altogether 

technology data security business continuity and disaster recovery risks 

any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our business customers team members and vendors that we hold whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise could damage our reputation with customers employees and vendors could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation and could materially affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity 

we depend on information systems and technology some of which are managed or provided by thirdparties for many activities important to our business as do most retailers we receive and store in our information systems certain personal and other sensitive information about our business  customers team members  and vendors additionally we also receive and process information permitting cashless payments as part of our instore and online operations at tractorsupplycom and petsensecom and on our mobile application some of which depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks the information that we receive and store makes us subject to cybersecurity attacks and cyber incidents which are occurring more frequently are constantly evolving in nature are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives we are the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and we continuously monitor our information technology networks and infrastructure in an effort to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact however these security measures cannot provide absolute assurance or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing detecting or responding to every such breach or disruption andor preventing the misuse of confidential information of our busines s customers team members or vendors similar risks exist with respect to the thirdparty vendors on which we rely for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions even if the attack or breach does not directly impact our systems or information 

a compromise of our information security and privacy controls or those of businesses and vendors with whom we interact which results in confidential information being accessed obtained damaged or used by unauthorized or improper parties loss or unavailability of data disruptions to our business activities or any other outcome stemming from a cybersecurity incident could materially adversely affect our reputation with our custome rs team members a nd vendors as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in significant legal and financial exposure beyond the scope or limits of insurance coverage moreover a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to respond to the attack or breach and could result in a disruption of our operations 

in addition states and the federal government have enacted laws and regulations relating to privacy data breaches and theft of employee and customer data these laws have increased the costs of doing business and if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required 

by some of these new laws we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies which could harm our business 

we are subject to paymentsrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit cards debit cards credit accounts our private label credit cards gift cards direct debit from a customer’s bank account consumer invoicing and physical bank checks and we may offer different payment options over time these payment options subject us to many compliance requirements including but not limited to compliance with payment card association operating rules including data security rules certification requirements rules governing electronic funds transfers and payment card industry data security standards they also subject us to potential fraud by criminal elements seeking to discover and take advantage of security vulnerabilities that may exist in some of these payment systems for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks gift cards and promotional financing and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements adequately encrypt payment transaction data or if our data security systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

our business and operations could suffer material losses in the event of system interruptions or failures 

our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services managed or provided by thirdparties serve an important role in the operation and administration of our business these systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources including but not limited to human error cybersecurity attacks computer viruses unauthorized access fire flood power outages telecommunication failures facility or equipment damage natural disasters terrorism and war in addition we continually make investments in technology to implement new processes and systems as well as to maintain and update our existing processes and systems implementing process and system changes increases the risk of disruption if our information technology systems are interrupted or fail and our redundant systems or recovery plans are not adequate to address such interruptions or failures on a timely basis our revenues and profits could be reduced and the reputation of our brand and our business could be materially adversely affected additionally remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant unplanned expenses 

customerfacing technology systems are an important part of our sales and marketing strategy and the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences 

through our continued information technology enhancements we believe we are able to provide an improved overall shopping environment and an omnichannel experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers tablets smart phones and other mobile communication devices we use our websites tractorsupplycom and petsensecom  and our mobile application as both a sales channel for our products and as a method of providing product project and other relevant information to our customers to drive instore and online sales omnichannel retailing is continually evolving and expanding and we must effectively respond to changing customer expectations and new developments the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers occurring online and through mobile applications has continued to increase and has accelerated significantly during the covid19 pandemic the pace of this increase could further accelerate in the future our business has evolved from an instore experience to interaction with customers across numerous channels including instore online mobile and social media among others omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments by our competitors our customers are increasingly using mobile phones tablets computers and other devices to shop and to interact with us through social media particularly in the wake of covid19 we are making investments in our websites and mobile applications if we are unable to make improve or develop relevant customerfacing technology in a timely manner our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected disruptions failures or other performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our instore and online business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers 

if we are unable to maintain or upgrade our management information systems and software programs or if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient and our longterm strategic growth initiatives may not be successful 

we depend on management information systems for many aspects of our business we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that we can continue to support our business we could be materially adversely affected if we experienced a disruption or data loss relating to our management information systems and are unable to recover timely we could also be adversely impacted if we are unable to improve upgrade maintain and expand our management information systems particularly in light of the contemplated continued store growth 

the success of our longterm strategic growth initiatives designed to increase our sales and improve margin are dependent in varying degrees on the timely delivery and the functionality of information technology systems to support them extended delays or cost overruns in securing developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support the longterm strategic growth initiatives would delay and possibly even prevent us from realizing the projected benefits of those initiatives 

financial risks 

changes in market conditions or in our credit rating could restrict capital and adversely affect our business operations and growth initiatives 

we rely on the positive cash flow we generate from our operating activities and our access to the credit and capital markets to fund our operations growth strategy capital expenditures and return of cash to our stockholders through share repurchases and dividends changes in the credit and capital markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to these potential sources of future liquidity our continued access to liquidity sources on favorable terms depends on multiple factors including our operating performance and credit ratings there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain andor improve our current credit ratings a rating organization may lower our rating or change our ratings’ outlook or decide not to rate our securities temporarily or permanently in its sole discretion in the event that our current credit ratings are downgraded or removed we would most likely incur higher borrowing costs and experience greater difficulty in obtaining additional financing which in turn would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity we can make no assurances that our ability to obtain additional financing through the debt and equity markets will not be adversely affected by economic conditions or that we will be able to maintain or improve our current credit ratings 

in addition tight lending practices may make it difficult for our real estate developers to obtain financing under acceptable loan terms and conditions unfavorable lending conditions could impact the timing of our store openings and materially adversely affect our ability to open new stores in desirable locations 

longerterm disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty changing or increased regulation reduced funding alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases cash dividends or other discretionary uses of cash 

our level of indebtedness could limit our cash flow available for operations and could adversely affect our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing 

as of december 25 2021 our total outstanding consolidated debt was approximately 9864 million our level of indebtedness could restrict our operations and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations our ability to make payments on our indebtedness to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this ability to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control our business may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity our ability to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all will be dependent upon a number of factors including our degree of leverage the value of our assets borrowing and other financial restrictions imposed by lenders and conditions in the credit markets at the time we refinance if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms we may be forced to agree to otherwise unfavorable financing terms this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition so long as we comply with any existing limitations in our credit and debt agreements while they are in effect we may issue an indeterminate amount of debt securities from time to time if new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries current debt levels the related risks that we and they now face could intensify 

our credit facilities the indenture related to our 175 senior notes and other debt instruments have restrictive covenants and change of control provisions that could limit our financial and business flexibility

covid19 risks 

the covid19 coronavirus pandemic has and could continue to have a material negative effect on our results of operations cash flows financial position and business operations 

the covid19 pandemic has created significant public health concerns as well as economic disruption uncertainty and volatility such as increased transportation costs supply chain distributions labor shortages increased overhead among other impacts which have and may continue to negatively affect our business operations 

despite the previous impacts of the pandemic on our business we are unable to predict the future impact that covid19 will have on our results of operations cash flows financial position and business operations due to numerous uncertainties these uncertainties include but are not limited to the severity of the virus the duration of the pandemic including the likelihood of resurgences and the emergence of variants the efficacy and public acceptance of vaccines governmental actions which include restrictions on our operations up to and including potential closure of our stores and distribution centers the duration and degree of quarantine or shelterinplace measures including additional measures that may still occur impacts on our supply chain which include suppliers of our products and our transportation vendors impacts on our distribution network the health of our workforce and our ability to maintain staffing needs to operate our business how macroeconomic factors evolve including unemployment rates and recessionary pressures the impact of the pandemic on consumer shopping patterns volatility in the economy as well as the credit and financial markets the incremental costs of doing business during the pandemic as well as on a longterm basis potential increases in insurance premiums medical claims costs and workers compensation claim costs unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time and other 

resources to the pandemic response potential delays in growth initiatives including the timing of new store openings potential adverse effects on our internal control environment and information security as a result of changes to a remote work environment and the longterm impact of the pandemic on our business 

in addition we cannot predict the impact that the pandemic will have on our manufacturers and suppliers of our products and other business partners such as service vendors however any material effect on these parties could adversely impact our results of operations and our ability to operate our business effectively 

the covid19 coronavirus pandemic has had and could continue to have a material negative effect on our supply chain and distribution network 

circumstances surrounding and related to the covid19 pandemic have created unprecedented impacts on the global supply chain our business relies on an efficient and effective supply chain including the manufacture and transportation of our products as well as the effective functioning of our distribution centers impacts related to the covid19 pandemic are placing strains on the domestic and international supply chains that have negatively affected and could continue to negatively affect the flow or availability of our products and result in higher outofstock inventory positions due to difficulties in timely obtaining product from the manufacturers and suppliers of our products as well as transportation of those products to our distribution centers and stores further we may have to source products from different manufacturers or geographic locations which could result in among other things higher product costs increased transportation costs delays in receiving products or lower quality of the products 

additionally the operation of our distribution centers is crucial to our business operations if our distribution centers experience closures or worker shortages whether temporary or sustained we could sustain significant adverse impacts related to the flow or availability of products to our stores and customers 

any of these circumstances could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales increased supply chain costs or damage to our reputation 

economic impacts stemming from the covid19 coronavirus pandemic could significantly impact our financial position including liquidity capital allocation and access to capital markets for additional funds to operate our business 

the financial and credit markets have experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility and turmoil as a result of the covid19 pandemic changes in the financial and credit markets could adversely impact our ability to access capital on favorable terms and continue to meet our liquidity needs 

additionally changes in our capital allocation strategy could have significant adverse impacts both short and longterm on our business results of operations and financial position any future suspension of our share repurchase program if necessary and depending on duration could negatively impact our earnings per share which in turn could adversely impact our common stock price while not contemplated at this time any potential suspension or reduction in our dividend declaration could have an adverse impact on investor perception and our common stock price 

actions taken to protect the health and safety of our team members and customers during the covid19 coronavirus pandemic have increased our operating costs and may not be sufficient to protect against operational or reputational harm to our business regulatory actions or claims and litigation 

in response to the covid19 pandemic we have taken a number of actions across our business to help protect our team members customers and others in the communities we serve these measures include encouraging vaccination efforts personal protective equipment for our team members following local and federal guidance regarding the use of masks in our facilities increased staffing in order to provide contactfree curbside pickup from stores expansion of our capabilities to support delivery to customer homes increased cleaning and sanitizing measures offering remote work plans at our store support center and monitoring for “social distancing” directives as well as additional cleaning materials in our facilities additionally we have provided appreciation bonuses as well as permanent increases in compensation and benefits for our team members in our stores and distribution centers to further support them during and after the covid19 pandemic actions such as these have resulted in significant incremental costs in fiscal 2021 and 2020 and we expect that we will continue to incur these costs for the foreseeable future which in turn will have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

the health and safety of our team members and customers are of primary concern to our management team however due to the unpredictable nature of this virus and the consequences of our actions we may see unexpected outcomes notwithstanding 

our added safety measures for instance if we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic or if our team members or customers do not participate in “social distancing” vaccination efforts and other safety measures the wellbeing of our team members and customers could be jeopardized furthermore any failure to appropriately respond or the perception of an inadequate response could cause reputational harm to our brand and subject us to claims and litigation from team members customers and service providers additionally we may experience increased litigation expenses resulting from team member or customer lawsuits including those related to the company’s covid19 response and team member or customer contraction of covid19 increased insurance costs medical claims costs and workers’ compensation claims costs and an adverse impact of regulatory and judicial changes in liability for workers’ compensation claims related to the covid19 pandemic 

further an outbreak of confirmed cases of covid19 in our stores or distribution centers could result in temporary or sustained workforce shortages or facility closures which would negatively impact our underlying business and results of operations

information regarding covid19 coronavirus pandemic 

the company has been and continues to closely monitor the impact of the covid19 pandemic on all facets of our business this includes the impact on our team members customers suppliers vendors business partners and supply chain networks 

the health and safety of our team members and customers are the primary concerns of our management team we have taken and continue to take numerous actions to promote health and safety including encouraging vaccination efforts providing personal protective equipment to our team members following local and federal guidance regarding the use of masks in our facilities maintaining enhanced services for cleaning and sanitation continuing to provide additional functionality to support contactless shopping experiences promoting social distancing in our stores and continuing to offer remote work plans at our store support center 

as further described in the results of operations our net sales have significantly increased due to unprecedented customer demand across all major product categories channels and geographic regions however the net incremental costs of doing business during this crisis have increased as a result of the aforementioned actions we have taken to support and promote the safety and wellbeing of our team members and customers and we believe some of these incremental costs will continue after the pandemic is over 

there are numerous uncertainties surrounding the pandemic and its impact on the economy and our business as further described in the risk factors section under part i item 1a of this form 10k which make it difficult to predict the impact on our business financial position or results of operations in fiscal 2022 and beyond while our stores distribution centers and ecommerce operations are open and plan to remain open we cannot predict the uncertainties or the corresponding impacts on our business at this time 

performance metrics 

comparable store metrics 

comparable store metrics are a key performance indicator used in the retail industry and by the company to measure the performance of the underlying business our comparable store metrics are calculated on an annual basis using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales and exclude certain adjustments to net sales stores closed during either of the years being compared are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations stores relocated during either of the years being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics calculations if the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics calculations became material we would remove relocated stores from the calculations 

transaction count and transaction value 

transaction count and transaction value metrics are used by the company to measure sales performance transaction count represents the number of customer transactions during a given period transaction value represents the average amount paid per transaction and is calculated as net sales divided by the total number of customer transactions during a given period 

significant accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our financial position andor results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies and estimates which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 

merchandise inventory 

we identify potentially excess and slowmoving inventory by evaluating turn rates historical and expected future sales trends age of merchandise overall inventory levels current cost of inventory and other benchmarks we have established an inventory valuation reserve to recognize the estimated impairment in value ie an inability to realize the full carrying value based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies 

we also have established a reserve for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts the reserve is established by assessing the chainwide average shrinkage experience rate applied to the related periods’ sales volumes such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences our general policy is to perform physical inventories at least once a year for each store that has been open more than twelve months 

we receive funding from substantially all of our significant merchandise vendors in support of our business initiatives through a variety of programs and arrangements including guaranteed vendor support funds “vendor support” and volumebased rebate funds “volume rebates” the amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements most of which are “evergreen” reflecting the ongoing relationship with our significant merchandise vendors certain of our agreements primarily volume rebates are renegotiated annually based on expected annual purchases of the vendor’s product vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold during interim periods the amount of vendor support and volume rebates are estimated based upon initial commitments and anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors 

we do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term however changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves our impairment reserves contain uncertainties because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding forecasted customer demand and the promotional environment the estimated store inventory shrink rate is based on historical experience we believe historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends our shrinkage reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding future shrinkage trends the effect of loss prevention measures and merchandising strategies 

for vendor funding we estimate the purchase volume and related vendor funding based on our current knowledge of inventory levels sales trends and expected customer demand as well as planned new store openings and relocations although we believe we can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related volume rebates at interim periods it is possible that actual yearend results could be different from previously estimated amounts our allocation methodology contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding customer demand purchasing activity target thresholds vendor attrition and collectability 

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize inventory impairment reserves or shrinkage in the financial periods presented we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate impairment or shrinkage however if assumptions regarding consumer demand clearance potential or inventory loss for certain products are inaccurate we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material a 10 change in our inventory impairment reserve as of december 25 2021 would have affected net income by approximately 13 million in fiscal 2021 a 10 change in our shrinkage reserve as of december 25 2021 would have affected net income by approximately 42 million in fiscal 2021 

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our vendor funding reserves in the financial periods presented at the end of each fiscal year a significant portion of the actual purchase activity is known thus we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the amounts recorded as vendor funding we do not believe there is a significant collectability risk related to vendor funding amounts due to us at the end of fiscal 2021 if a 10 reserve had been applied against our outstanding vendor funding due as of december 25 2021 net income would have been affected by approximately 23 million in fiscal 2021 although it is unlikely that there will be any significant reduction in historical levels of vendor funding if such a reduction were to occur in future periods the company could experience a higher inventory balance and higher cost of sales

we selfinsure a significant portion of our workers’ compensation insurance and general liability including product liability insurance plans we have stoploss insurance policies to protect from individual losses over specified dollar values provisions for losses related to our selfinsured liabilities are based upon periodic independent actuarially determined estimates that consider a number of factors including historical claims experience loss development factors and severity factors 

the full extent of certain workers’ compensation and general liability claims may not become fully determined for several years our selfinsured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date based upon historical data and experience including actuarial calculations 

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our selfinsurance reserves in the financial periods presented we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the assumptions we use to calculate insurance reserves however if we experience a significant increase in the number of claims or the cost associated with these claims we may be exposed to losses that could be material a 10 change in our selfinsurance reserves as of december 25 2021 would have affected net income by approximately 84 million in fiscal 2021 

impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets including lease rightofuse assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable when evaluating longlived assets for potential impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows the evaluation for longlived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is generally the individual store level the significant assumptions used to determine estimated undiscounted cash flows include cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations including margin on net sales payroll and related items occupancy costs insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the related asset we calculate an impairment loss the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the related asset or asset group to its estimated fair value which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model market valuation or other valuation technique as appropriate we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset’s carrying value exceeds the asset’s estimated fair value if we recognize an impairment loss the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis for a depreciable longlived asset the new cost basis will be depreciated amortized over the remaining estimated useful life of that asset 

our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values 

we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology in the financial periods presented 

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate longlived asset impairment losses none of these estimates and assumptions are significantly sensitive and a 10 

change in any of these estimates would not have a material impact on our analysis however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to losses that could be material 

there were no significant longlived assets impairment charges recognized in fiscal 2021 

impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with the accounting standards an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill or an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if after such assessment an entity concludes that the asset is not impaired then the entity is not required to take further action however if an entity concludes otherwise then it is required to determine the fair value of the asset using a quantitative impairment test and if impaired the associated assets must be written down to fair value 

the quantitative impairment test for goodwill compares the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying value of its net assets including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit an impairment charge would be recorded to the company’s operations for the amount in which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value we determine fair values for each reporting unit using the market approach when available and appropriate the income approach or a combination of both the income approach involves forecasting projected financial information such as revenue growth rates profit margins tax rates and capital expenditures and selecting a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in estimated future cash flows under the market approach the fair value is based on observed market data if multiple valuation methodologies are used the results are weighted appropriately 

the quantitative impairment test for other indefinitelived intangible assets involves comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of the discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the implied fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than the carrying value an impairment charge would be recorded to the company’s operations 

our impairment loss calculation contains uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to qualitative factors as well as estimate future cash flows and asset fair values including forecasting projected financial information and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

the valuation approaches utilized to estimate fair value for the purposes of the impairment tests of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets require the use of assumptions and estimates which involve a degree of uncertainty if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to noncash impairment losses that could be material 

there were no goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets impairment charges recognized in fiscal 2021 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in the consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales 



a our gross margin amounts may not be comparable to those of other retailers since some retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution facility network in cost of merchandise sold and others like our company exclude a portion of these distribution facility network costs from gross margin and instead include them in selling general and administrative expenses refer to note 1 – significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 

net sales increased 199 to 1273 billion in fiscal 2021 from 1062 billion in fiscal 2020 comparable store sales increased 169 to 1243 billion versus a 231 increase in fiscal 2020 the comparable store average transaction value increased 98 and comparable store average transaction count increased 71 for fiscal 2021 as compared to an increase of 122 and 109 in fiscal 2020 respectively 

our sales performance continued to benefit from the shift of consumer behavior trends due to the covid19 pandemic as customers focused on the care of their homes land and animals targeted investments in marketing to increase our unaided brand awareness and other key initiatives to enhance customers shopping experience including the relaunch of the neighbors club loyalty program these factors led to growth in new customer acquisition and increased spend from existing customers which further resulted in an increase in comparable store sales across all major product categories driven by robust growth for everyday merchandise including cue products and solid demand for seasonal categories in addition the company’s ecommerce sales experienced doubledigit percentage growth in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 

in addition to comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2021 sales from stores opened less than one year were 3246 million in fiscal 2021 which represented 31 percentage points of the 199 increase over fiscal 2020 net sales sales from stores opened less than one year were 3553 million in fiscal 2020 which represented 43 percentage points of the 272 increase over fiscal 2019 net sales 

the following table summarizes our store growth during fiscal 2021 and 2020 



the following table indicates the percentage of net sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2021 and 2020 



gross profit increased 190 to 448 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to 376 billion in fiscal 2020 as a percent of net sales gross margin decreased 25 basis points to 352 for fiscal 2021 compared to 354 for fiscal 2020 the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by higher product cost inflation higher transportation costs driven by increased pressures on domestic freight import freight and rising fuel prices and product mix shift towards cue products which run at a slightly lower margin rate partially offsetting the decrease was the companys price management program and limited promotional and clearance activity which effectively offset a significant portion of the inflation and transportation pressures 

total selling general and administrative “sga” expenses including depreciation and amortization and asset impairment increased 147 to 317 billion in fiscal 2021 from 276 billion in fiscal 2020 sga expenses as a percent of net sales improved 113 basis points to 249 in fiscal 2021 from 260 in fiscal 2020 the sga expenses in fiscal 2020 were impacted by discrete noncash impairment charges for the petsense business of 741 million due primarily to a strategic reassessment of the business and a decision to reduce the number of new store openings planned over the long term and to a lesser extent the impairment of longlived assets at underperforming locations on an adjusted basis excluding the impact of the discrete impairment charges in the prior year sga expenses increased 178 to 317 billion in fiscal 2021 from 269 billion in fiscal 2020 on an adjusted basis sga expenses as a percent of net sales improved 43 basis points to 249 in fiscal 2021 from 253 in fiscal 2020 the improvement in sga as a percent as net sales was primarily attributable to strong leverage in occupancy and other fixed costs from the increase in comparable store sales and lower covid19 pandemic response costs covid19 pandemic response costs in fiscal 2021 of 633 million consisted of sick pay benefits and other health and safety related expenses as compared to 1171 million in fiscal 2020 the leverage from these sga expenses was partially offset by higher store wage rates additional store labor hours and investment in the companys strategic initiatives 

our effective income tax rate decreased to 221 for fiscal 2021 compared to 226 in fiscal 2020 the primary drivers for the decrease in the companys effective income tax rate were additional benefits from sharebased compensation a reduction in 

disallowed executive compensation and increases in available tax credits partially offset by a small increase in the companys provision for state taxes 

net income in fiscal 2021 was 9971 million or 861 per diluted share compared to 7490 million or 638 per diluted share in fiscal 2020 the aforementioned noncash impairment expense related to the petsense business had an aftertax impact on fiscal 2020 net income of approximately 573 million or 049 per diluted share on an adjusted basis considering the aftertax impact of the noncash impairment charges related to the petsense business net income was 8062 million  or 687 per diluted share for fiscal 2020  adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are nongaap measures which have been provided in order to enhance comparability for the periods presented given that the impairment charges related to the petsense business are nonrecurring in nature a reconciliation of these nongaap financial measures is included in the following table 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

in thousands except per share amounts 



a comprised of 6897 million of impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets along with 508 million of impairment of other longlived assets related to the petsense reporting unit 

during fiscal 2021 we repurchased approximately 44 million shares of the company’s common stock at a total cost of 7989 million as part of our share repurchase program in fiscal 2020 we repurchased approximately 34 million shares at a total cost of 3430 million s hares repurchased in fiscal 2020 were impacted by the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program from march 12 2020 until november 5 2020 in order to strengthen our liquidity and preserve cash while navigating the covid19 pandemic 

fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 

for a comparison of our performance and financial metrics for the fiscal years ended december 26 2020 and december 28 2019 see “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 26 2020 filed with the sec on february 18 2021 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

in addition to normal operating expenses and expenses associated with covid19 our primary ongoing cash requirements are for new store expansion existing store remodeling and improvements store relocations distribution facility capacity and improvements information technology inventory purchases repayment of existing borrowings under our debt facilities share repurchases cash dividends and selective acquisitions as opportunities arise 

our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are existing cash balances cash provided from operations remaining funds available under our debt facilities operating and finance leases and normal trade credit our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters to support the higher sales volume of the spring and coldweather selling seasons respectively 

we believe that our existing cash balances expected cash flow from future operations funds available under our debt facilities operating and finance leases and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations including expenses associated with covid19 and our capital expenditure needs including new store openings existing store remodeling and improvements 

store relocations distribution facility capacity and improvements and information technology improvements through the end of fiscal 2022 we are not aware of any trends or events that would materially affect our capital requirements or liquidity 

working capital 

at december 25 2021 the company had working capital of 119 billion which decreased 3293 million from fiscal 2020 the shifts in working capital were attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities in millions 



in comparison to december 26 2020 working capital as of december 25 2021 was impacted most significantly by changes in cash and cash equivalents inventories accounts payable and other accrued expenses 

• the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily driven by share repurchases capital expenditures to support strategic growth and cash dividends to stockholders 

• the increase in inventories resulted from an increase in average inventory per store driven by our commitment to support our strong sales trends along with the impact of inflation and the purchase of additional inventory to support new store growth 

• the increase in accounts payable resulted from the purchase of additional inventory to support new store growth and strong sales volume trends 

• other accrued expenses increased primarily due to increases in freight and other payables due to the growth in sales 

debt 

the following table summarizes the company’s outstanding debt as of the dates indicated in millions 



on october 30 2020 the company issued and sold in a public offering 650 million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due november 1 2030 bearing interest at 175 per annum the “175 senior notes” in support of the issuance of the 175 senior notes we obtained credit ratings from moodys investor services and standard  poors 

we manage our business and financial ratios to target an investmentgrade bond rating which has historically allowed flexible access to financing at reasonable market costs as of december 25 2021 and the date of this filing february 17 2022 the companys senior unsecured debt is rated “baa1” by moody’s investor services with a stable outlook and “bbb” by standard  poor’s with a stable outlook these ratings have been obtained with the understanding that moody’s investors services and standard  poor’s will continue to monitor our credit and make future adjustments to these ratings to the extent warranted the ratings are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our securities may be changed superseded or withdrawn at any time and should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

our current ratings as well as future rating agency actions could impact our ability to finance our operations on satisfactory terms and affect our financing costs there can be no assurance that we will maintain or improve our current credit ratings 

we also maintain a 500 million revolving credit facility the “revolver” under the senior credit facility the senior credit facility with a sublimit of 50 million for swingline loans and a sublimit of 150 million for letters of credit

sources and uses of cash 

our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and funds available under our debt facilities principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures while principal uses of cash for financing activities are repurchase of the company’s common stock and cash dividends paid to stockholders 

the following table presents a summary of cash flows provided by or used in operating investing and financing activities for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 in millions 



operating activities 

operating activities provided cash of 114 billion and 139 billion in fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively the 2558 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was due to changes in the following in millions 



the 2558 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 is primarily driv en by a significant increase in inventory and timing of payments and accruals partially offset by an increase in our net income 

investing activities 

investing activities used cash of 6273 million and 2922 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively the 3351 million increase in net cash used in investing activities primarily reflects an increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 

investing activities including capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 and 2020 were as follows in millions 



the increase in spending for existing stores in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 principally reflects our strategic initiatives related to store remodels including internal space productivity and the outside side lot improvements the spending on information technology represents continued support of our store growth and our omnichannel initiatives as well as improvements in security and compliance enhancements and upgrades to our customer loyalty program mobility in our stores and other strategic initiatives 

the increase in spending for distribution center capacity and improvements in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 is principally related to beginning construction of a new distribution center in navarre ohio which is expected to be approximately 900000 square feet and is currently anticipated to be completed in the fall of fiscal 2022 

the above table reflects an investment in 80 new tractor supply stores and seven new petsense stores during fiscal 2021 in fiscal 2020 we opened 80 new tractor supply stores nine new petsense stores and had one store relocation 

our projected capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 are currently estimated to be in a range of approximately 625 million to 675 million the capital expenditures include a plan to open approximately 75 to 80 new tractor supply stores remodel more than 150 stores and transform the side lots in approximately 100 locations along with opening 10 new petsense stores we also anticipate the opening of our ninth distribution center in navarre ohio in the fall of 2022 additionally we plan to begin construction in the middle of fiscal 2022 on a new distribution center in maumelle arkansas which is currently anticipated to be complete in late 2023 in addition we plan to support our continued improvements in technology and infrastructure at our existing stores and ongoing investments to enhance our digital and omnichannel capabilities to better serve our customers 

financing activities 

financing activities used cash of 9751 million in fiscal 2021 while financing activities provided 1552 million in fiscal 2020 the 113 billion decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was due to changes in the following in millions 



the decrease in net cash from financing activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 is principally due to actions taken in fiscal 2020 intended to strengthen our liquidity and preserve cash while navigating the covid19 pandemic including borrowings under our debt facilities as well as a temporary suspension of our share repurchase program 

repurchase of common stock 

the company’s board of directors has authorized common stock repurchases under a share repurchase program which was announced in february 2007 the authorization amount of the program which has been increased from time to time is currently authorized for up to 650 billion exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses related to such repurchases the currently authorized amount reflects a 20 billion increase to the existing share repurchase program which was approved by our board of directors o n january 26 2022 the s hare repurchase program does not have an expiration date the repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions the timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors including price corporate and regulatory requirements capital availability and other market conditions repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance the program may be limited temporarily paused or terminated at any time without prior notice 

we repurchased approximately 44 million and 34 million shares of common stock under the share repurchase program at a total cost of 7989 million and 3430 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively as of december 25 2021 prior to the expanded 20 billion repurchase authorization the company had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of 3450 million exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses shares repurchased in fiscal 2020 were impacted by the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program from march 12 2020 until november 5 2020 in order to strengthen our liquidity and preserve cash while navigating the covid19 pandemic our projected share repurchases for fiscal 2022 are currently estimated to be in a range of approximately 700 million to 800 million 

cash dividends paid to stockholders 

we paid cash dividends totaling 2390 million and 1747 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively in fiscal 2021 we declared and paid cash dividends to stockholders of 208 per common share outstanding as compared to 150 per common share outstanding in fiscal 2020 these payments reflect an increase in the quarterly dividend in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 to 052 per share from 040 per share and an increase in the quarterly dividend in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 from 035 per share 

on january 26 2022 the company’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 092 per share of the company’s outstanding common stock the dividend will be paid on march 8 2022 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on february 21 2022 

it is the present intention of the company’s board of directors to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend however the declaration and payment amount of future dividends will be determined by the company’s board of directors in its sole discretion and will depend upon the earnings financial condition and capital needs of the company along with any other factors which the company’s board of directors deem relevant 

new accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued pronouncements not yet adopted as of december 25 2021 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of borrowings under our senior credit facility as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements which bear interest based on variable rates 

a 1 change in interest rates on our variable rate debt in excess of that amount covered by the interest rate swaps would have affected interest expense by approximately 20 million 24 million and 19 million in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively based on the amount of outstanding variable rate debt as of december 25 2021 excluding those borrowings for which we have interest rate swaps a 1 change in interest rates would not result in any material increase in our interest expense on a prospective basis 

purchase price volatility 

although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items grain corn steel petroleum cotton and other commodities as well as duties tariffs diesel fuel and transportation services therefore we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost which may impact consumer demand and as a result sales and gross margin our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale from increased volume of purchases adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality

achieving this strategy will require a foundational focus on 1 connecting empowering and growing our team to enhance their lives and the communities they live in enabling them to provide legendary service to our customers and 2 allocating resources in a disciplined and efficient manner to drive profitable growth and build shareholder value including leveraging technology and automation to align our cost structure to support new business capabilities for margin improvement and cost reductions 

over the past five years we have experienced considerable sales growth resulting in a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 113 we plan to open approximately 80 new tractor supply and 10 new petsense stores in fiscal 2021 a selling square footage increase of approximately 4 in fiscal 2020 we opened 80 new tractor supply stores and nine new 

petsense stores in fiscal 2019 we opened 80 new tractor supply stores and eight new petsense stores this represents a selling square footage increase of approximately 4 during each of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 

at december 26 2020 we operated 2105 retail stores in 49 states 1923 tractor supply and del’s retail stores and 182 petsense retail stores given the size of the communities that we target we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in many existing and new markets we have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and we believe we have significant additional opportunities for new tractor supply stores we also believe that there is opportunity for continued growth for petsense stores 

approximately 56 of our stores are in freestanding buildings and 44 are located in shopping centers we lease approximately 95 of our stores and own the remaining 5 

in addition to new store expansion we also plan to further support our strategic growth through expansion of our distribution network and initiatives including among others space productivity and side lot improvements in certain existing stores as well as continued improvements in technology and infrastructure at our existing stores and ongoing investments to enhance our digital and omnichannel capabilities to better serve our customers 

competition 

we operate in a competitive retail industry the principal competitive factors include location of stores fulfillment options price quality of merchandise instock inventory consistency merchandise assortment and presentation product knowledge online competitors and customer service we compete with general merchandise retailers home center retailers pet retailers specialty and discount retailers independently owned retail farm and ranch stores numerous privatelyheld regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives as well as internetbased retailers however we believe we successfully differentiate ourselves from many of these retailers by focusing on our specialized market niche for customers living the rural lifestyle see further discussion of competition in 1a “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10k 

seasonality and weather 

our business is seasonal historically our sales and profits are the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products we usually experience our highest inventory and accounts payable balances during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal products to support the higher sales volume of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter to support the higher sales volume of the coldweather selling season we believe that our business can be more accurately assessed by focusing on the performance of the halves not the quarters due to the fact that different weather patterns from yeartoyear can shift the timing of sales and profits between quarters particularly between the first and second fiscal quarters and the third and fourth fiscal quarters 

historically weather conditions including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and unseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months have unfavorably affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations in addition extreme weather conditions including snow and ice storms flood and wind damage hurricanes tornadoes extreme rain and droughts have impacted operating results both negatively and positively depending on the severity and length of these conditions our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends 

furthermore we are not able to predict at this time the impact that the covid19 pandemic may have on the seasonality of our business in the future 

stewardship and compliance with environmental matters 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment we are committed to complying with all applicable environmental laws and regulations we are also committed to becoming a more environmentally sustainable company this commitment is demonstrated through our stewardship program which is our environmental sustainability program through this program the company has implemented a number of initiatives designed to reduce our impact on the environment these initiatives include the installation of energy management systems led lighting high efficiency heatingair conditioning systems and recycling programs in our stores distribution facilities and store support center our store support center and our distribution centers in casa grande arizona and frankfort new york are leed leadership in energy and environmental design silver certified for environmentally sustainable design construction and operation we also installed solar arrays at the store support center in brentwood tennessee and our tractor supply store in hendersonville tennessee 

the company has been a smartway transport partner since 2013 smartway transport is a publicprivate initiative between the us environmental protection agency large and small trucking companies retailers and other federal and state agencies its purpose is to improve fuel efficiency and the environmental performance reduction of both greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution of supply chains

 item 1a  risk factors 

our business faces many risks certain risks of which we are currently aware and deem to be material are described below if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur our business financial condition or results of operations may significantly suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this form 10k 

strategic and competitive risks 

failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name or any of our exclusive brands 

our success depends in part on the value and strength of the tractor supply name including our exclusive brands the tractor supply name is integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business maintaining promoting and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide high quality merchandise and a consistent high quality customer experience our brand could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity failure to comply or accusation of failure to comply with ethical social product labor data privacy and environmental standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions any of these events could result in decreased revenue or otherwise adversely affect our business 

we may be unable to increase sales at our existing stores 

we experience fluctuations in our comparable store sales at our existing stores defined as sales in stores which have been open for at least twelve months various factors affect the comparable store sales at our existing stores including among others the general retail sales environment our ability to efficiently source and distribute products changes in our merchandise assortment competition proximity of our locations to one another or to the locations of other competing retailers increased presence of online retailers current economic conditions customer satisfaction with our products retail pricing the timing of promotional events the release of new merchandise the success of marketing programs weather conditions and our ability to attract and retain qualified team members these factors may cause the comparable store sales results at our existing stores to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations past comparable store sales are not an indication of future results and there can be no assurance that our comparable store sales will not decrease in the future 

furthermore the significant positive impact of the covid19 pandemic on the demand for our products in fiscal 2020 resulted in a significant increase in new or reacquired customers and in comparable store sales growth our sales performance in fiscal 2020 may present a greater risk to our ability to increase comparable store sales in the following years and in our ability to 

maintain our new or reacquired customers gained in fiscal 2020 therefore we may not be able to sustain or increase our comparable store sales in fiscal 2021 and beyond 

failure to open and manage new stores in the number and manner currently contemplated could adversely affect our financial performance 

an integral part of our business strategy includes the expansion of our store base through new store openings this expansion strategy is dependent on our ability to find suitable locations and we face competition from many retailers and other businesses for such sites if we are unable to implement this strategy our ability to increase our sales profitability and cash flow could be impaired significantly to the extent that we are unable to open new stores in the manner we anticipate due to among other reasons site approval or unforeseen delays in construction our sales growth may be impeded 

as we execute this expansion strategy we may also experience managerial or operational challenges which may prevent any expected increase in sales profitability or cash flow our ability to manage our planned expansion depends on the adequacy of our existing information systems the efficiency and expansion of our distribution systems the adequacy of the hiring and training process for new personnel especially store managers the effectiveness of our controls and procedures and the ability to identify customer demand and build market awareness in different geographic areas there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our planned expansion that the new stores will be effectively integrated into our existing operations or that such stores will be profitable 

although we have a rigorous real estate site selection and approval process there can be no assurance that our new store openings will be successful or result in incremental sales and profitability for the company new stores build their sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection over time and as a result generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our more mature stores as we continue to open new stores there may be a negative impact on our results from a lower contribution margin of these new stores until their sales levels ramp to chain average if at all as well as from the impact of related preopening costs additionally new stores can also impact the sales and contribution margins of existing stores located in close proximity 

our merchandising and marketing initiatives may not provide expected results 

we believe our past performance has been based on and future success will depend in part upon the ability to develop and execute merchandising initiatives with effective marketing programs these merchandising initiatives and marketing programs may not deliver expected results and there is no assurance that we will correctly identify and respond in a timely manner to evolving trends and consumer preferences and expectations further adverse publicity about our merchandise products whether valid or not may discourage consumers from buying the products we offer if we misjudge the market or our marketing programs are not successful we may overstock unpopular products and be forced to take inventory impairment or retail price reductions that have a material adverse effect on our profitability failure to execute and promote such initiatives in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow the business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition shortages of key merchandise could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

competition may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations 

we operate in the highly competitive retail merchandise sector with numerous competitors these competitors include general merchandise retailers home center retailers pet retailers specialty and discount retailers independentlyowned retail farm and ranch stores numerous privatelyheld regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives as well as internetbased retailers we compete for customers merchandise real estate locations and employees this competitive environment subjects us to various other risks including the inability to continue our store and sales growth and to provide attractive merchandise to our customers at competitive prices that allow us to maintain our profitability our failure to compete effectively in this environment could adversely impact our financial performance 

we may pursue strategic acquisitions and the failure of an acquisition to produce the anticipated results or the inability to fully integrate the acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business 

we may from time to time acquire businesses we believe to be complementary to our business the success of an acquisition is based on our ability to make accurate assumptions regarding the valuation operations growth potential integration and other factors relating to the target business acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and may result in the diversion of our capital and our management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities we may not 

be able to successfully integrate an organization that we acquire including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures if we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions we could experience increased costs associated with operating inefficiencies which could have an adverse effect on our financial results also while we employ several different methodologies to assess potential business opportunities the new businesses may not meet our expectations and therefore adversely affect our financial performance additionally acquired businesses may not achieve desired profitability objectives causing lower than expected earnings and cash flows which could subsequently require impairment of longlived assets goodwill and other intangible assets 

weather and climate risks 

weather conditions may have a significant impact on our financial results 

weather conditions affect the demand for and in some cases the supply of products which in turn has an impact on prices historically weather conditions including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and unseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months have affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations in addition extreme weather conditions including snow and ice storms flood and wind damage hurricanes tornadoes extreme rain fires and droughts have impacted operating results while extreme weather conditions can positively impact our operating results by increasing demand in affected locations for products needed to cope with the weather condition and its effects they can also negatively affect our business depending on the severity and length of these conditions as a result of store closings damage to our stores or merchandise or the inability of customers to shop at our stores due to weather conditions our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends should such a strategy not be effective the weather may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

weather conditions may cause a disruption in our distribution and transportation network that would adversely affect our ability to conduct our operations 

we rely on our distribution and transportation network including thirdparty logistics providers to provide goods to our stores and to our customers in a timely and costeffective manner through deliveries to our distribution facilities from vendors and then from the distribution facilities or direct ship vendors to our stores or customers by various means of transportation including shipments by sea air rail and truck although we believe that our operations are efficient disruptions due to extreme weather conditions including snow and ice storms flood and wind damage hurricanes tornadoes extreme rain fires and droughts may result in delays in the transportation and delivery of merchandise to our distribution centers our stores or our customers significant disruptions or delays in our distribution and transportation network could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our customers which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business 

we use natural gas diesel fuel gasoline and electricity in conducting our operations increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may result in increased compliance costs and legislation or regulation affecting energy inputs which could materially affect our profitability further climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in the quantities that we currently expect additionally climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more frequent or intense hurricanes thunderstorms tornadoes floods fire drought and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels all of which may negatively impact our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

macroeconomic risks 

general economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance 

our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending including discretionary spending a weakening of economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as lower employment levels uncertainty or changes in business or political conditions higher interest rates higher tax rates higher fuel and energy costs higher labor and healthcare costs the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism general health epidemics and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to competitors a general reduction in the level of discretionary spending shifts in consumer discretionary spending to our competitors or shifts in discretionary spending to less profitable products sold by us could result in lower net sales slower inventory turnover greater markdowns on inventory and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins 

purchase price volatility including inflationary and deflationary pressures may adversely affect our financial performance 

although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items grain corn steel petroleum cotton and other commodities as well as duties tariffs diesel fuel and transportation services therefore we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost which may impact consumer demand and as a result sales and gross margin our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale from increased volume of purchases adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors while maintaining product quality should our strategy to mitigate purchase price volatility not be effective our financial performance could be adversely impacted 

team member risks 

our failure to attract and retain qualified team members increases in wage and labor costs and changes in laws and other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to maintain and continue expanding operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified team members our ability to meet labor needs while controlling wage and related labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force unemployment levels prevailing wage rates increases in legally required minimum wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs changes in employment legislation and the potential for changes in local labor practices or union activities if we are unable to locate attract or retain qualified personnel or if costs of labor or related costs increase significantly our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we are subject to federal state and local laws governing employment practices and working conditions these laws cover wage and hour practices labor relations paid and family leave workplace safety and immigration among others the laws and regulations being passed at the state and local level create unique challenges for a multistate employer we must continue to monitor and adapt our employment practices to comply with these various laws and regulations if our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly as new or revised labor laws rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented our financial performance could be adversely affected 

the loss of current members of our senior management team and other key team members or the failure to successfully manage an executive officer transition may adversely affect our operating results 

our success depends in large part on the continued availability and service of our executive officers senior management and other key team members competition for senior management and key team members in our industry is strong and we may not be able to retain our key team members or attract new qualified team members we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other team members sufficiently both to maintain our current business and to execute our longterm strategic growth initiatives the loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management without sufficient advance notice could prevent or delay the implementation and completion of our strategic initiatives or divert management’s attention to seeking qualified replacements additionally any failure by us to manage a successful leadership transition of an executive officer and to timely identify a qualified permanent replacement could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

supply chain and thirdparty vendor risks 

we face risks associated with vendors from whom our products are sourced 

the products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors we have agreements with our vendors in which the vendors agree to comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and to indemnify us against certain liabilities and costs our ability to recover liabilities and costs under these vendor agreements is dependent upon the financial condition and integrity of the vendors we rely on longterm relationships with our suppliers but have no significant longterm contracts with such suppliers our future success will depend in large measure upon our ability to maintain our existing supplier relationships or to develop new ones this reliance exposes us to the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various products due to political economic social health including but not limited to the covid19 coronavirus or environmental conditions transportation delays or changes in laws and regulations affecting distribution our 

vendors may be forced to reduce their production shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection which could make it difficult for us to serve the market’s needs and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

while the company selects these thirdparty vendors carefully it does not control their actions or the components or manufacture of their products any problems caused by these thirdparties or issues associated with their products or workforce including customer or governmental complaints breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes and cyber attacks or security breaches at a vendor could subject the company to litigation and adversely affect the company’s ability to deliver products and services to its customers and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on foreign manufacturers for various products that we sell in addition many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources as an importer our business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business internationally such as domestic and foreign governmental regulations economic disruptions global or regional health epidemics delays in shipments transportation capacity and costs currency exchange rates and changes in political or economic conditions in countries from which we purchase products if any such factors were to render the conduct of business in particular countries undesirable or impractical or if additional us quotas duties tariffs taxes or other charges or restrictions were imposed upon the importation of our products in the future our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

the political landscape in the us contains uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies tariffs and regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries we source a portion of our merchandise from manufacturers located outside the us primarily in asia and central america major developments in tax policy or trade relations such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise or the imposition of tariffs on imported products could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on manufacturers located in foreign countries including china for merchandise additionally a portion of our domestically purchased merchandise is manufactured abroad our business may be materially adversely affected by risks associated with international trade including the impact of tariffs imposed and potential by the us with respect to certain consumer goods imported from china 

we source a portion of our merchandise from manufacturers located outside the us primarily in asia and central america and many of our domestic vendors have a global supply chain the us has imposed tariffs on certain products imported into the us from china and could propose additional tariffs the imposition of tariffs on imported products has increased our costs and could result in reduced sales and profits in addition the imposition of tariffs by the us has resulted in the adoption of tariffs by china on us exports and could result in the adoption of tariffs by other countries as well a resulting trade war could have a significant adverse effect on world trade and the world economy further the imposition of tariffs or other changes in world trade could have an impact on certain us industries and consumers and could negatively impact the consumer demand for products that we sell 

we continue to evaluate the impact of the effective and potential tariffs on our supply chain costs sales and profitability as well as our strategies to mitigate any negative impact including negotiating with our vendors seeking alternative sourcing options and adjusting retail selling prices given the uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of the current and potential tariffs as well as the potential for additional trade actions by the us or other countries the impact on our business results of operations and financial condition is uncertain but could be significant thus we can provide no assurance that any strategies we implement to mitigate the impact of such tariffs or other trade actions will be successful in whole or in part in mitigating the impact of any current or future tariffs to the extent that our supply chain costs sales or profitability are negatively affected by the tariffs or other trade actions our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

a significant disruption to our distribution network or to the timely receipt of inventory could adversely impact sales or increase our transportation costs which would decrease our profits 

we rely on our distribution and transportation network including thirdparty logistics providers to provide goods to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner through deliveries to our distribution facilities from vendors and then from the distribution facilities or direct ship vendors to our stores or customers by various means of transportation including shipments by sea air rail and truck any disruption unanticipated expense or operational failure related to this process could negatively affect our operations for example unexpected delivery delays including delays due to weather fuel shortages work stoppages global or regional health epidemics product shortages from vendors or other reasons or increases in transportation 

costs including increased fuel costs or a decrease in transportation capacity for overseas shipments could significantly decrease our ability to provide adequate products for sale or products at a desired price resulting in lower sales and profitability in addition labor shortages or work stoppages in the transportation industry or longterm disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries could negatively affect our business also a fire tornado or other disaster at one of our distribution facilities could disrupt our timely receiving processing and shipment of merchandise to our stores which could adversely affect our business 

the implementation of our supply chain initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail 

we maintain a network of distribution facilities and have plans to build new distribution facilities and expand existing facilities to support our longterm strategic growth initiatives delays in opening new or expanded distribution facilities could adversely affect our future operations by slowing store growth or negatively impacting our fulfillment capabilities which may in turn reduce revenue growth in addition distributionrelated construction or expansion projects entail risks which could cause delays and cost overruns such as shortages of materials shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages unforeseen construction scheduling engineering environmental or geological problems weather interference fires or other casualty losses and unanticipated cost increases the completion date and ultimate cost of future projects could differ significantly from initial expectations due to constructionrelated or other reasons we cannot guarantee that all projects will be completed on time or within established budgets 

we continue to make significant technology investments in our supply chain these initiatives are designed to streamline our distribution process so that we can optimize the delivery of goods and services to our stores distribution facilities and customers in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives including those associated with managing thirdparty service providers and employing new webbased tools and services could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term in addition our improved supply chain technology might not provide the anticipated benefits it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the initiatives might fail altogether 

we face risks from our use of service providers or other thirdparties whom we rely upon for conducting our business 

the company is dependent upon numerous service providers and other thirdparties to conduct our business including ecommerce among others while the company selects these thirdparty vendors carefully it does not control their actions any failure of these thirdparties to provide the expected or agreedupon level of service in a timely manner for any reason could adversely affect the company’s ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business further our reputation or brand could be adversely impacted by the actions of these thirdparties 

technology data security business continuity and disaster recovery risks 

any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our business customers employees and vendors that we hold whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise could damage our reputation with customers employees and vendors could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation and could materially affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity 

we depend on information systems and technology some of which are managed or provided by thirdparties for many activities important to our business as do most retailers we receive and store in our information systems certain personal and other sensitive information about our business customers employees and vendors additionally we also receive and process information permitting cashless payments as part of our instore and online operations at tractorsupplycom and petsensecom and on our mobile application some of which depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks the information that we receive and store makes us subject to cybersecurity attacks cyber incidents and privacy regulations which are occurring more frequently are constantly evolving in nature are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives we are the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and continuously monitor our information technology networks and infrastructure in an effort to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact however these security measures cannot provide absolute assurance or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing detecting or responding to every such breach or disruption andor preventing the misuse of confidential information of our business customers employees or vendors similar risks exist with respect to the thirdparty vendors that we rely upon for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions even if the attack or breach does not directly impact our systems or information 

a compromise of our information security and privacy controls or those of businesses and vendors with whom we interact which results in confidential information being accessed obtained damaged or used by unauthorized or improper parties loss or unavailability of data disruptions to our business activities or any other outcome stemming from a cybersecurity incident could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers team members and vendors as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in significant legal and financial exposure beyond the scope or limits of insurance coverage moreover a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to respond to the attack or breach and could result in a disruption of our operations 

in addition states and the federal government are increasingly enacting laws and regulations relating to privacy data breaches and theft of employee and customer data these laws will likely increase the costs of doing business and if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these new laws we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies which could harm our business 

we are subject to paymentsrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit cards debit cards credit accounts our private label credit cards gift cards direct debit from a customer’s bank account consumer invoicing and physical bank checks and we may offer different payment options over time these payment options subject us to many compliance requirements including but not limited to compliance with payment card association operating rules including data security rules certification requirements rules governing electronic funds transfers and payment card industry data security standards they also subject us to potential fraud by criminal elements seeking to discover and take advantage of security vulnerabilities that may exist in some of these payment systems for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks gift cards and promotional financing and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements adequately encrypt payment transaction data or if our data security systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

our business and operations could suffer material losses in the event of system interruptions or failures 

our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services managed or provided by thirdparties serve an important role in the operation and administration of our business these systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources including but not limited to human error cybersecurity attacks computer viruses unauthorized access fire flood power outages telecommunication failures facility or equipment damage natural disasters terrorism and war in addition we continually make investments in technology to implement new processes and systems as well as to maintain and update our existing processes and systems implementing process and system changes increases the risk of disruption if our information technology systems are interrupted or fail and our redundant systems or recovery plans are not adequate to address such interruptions or failures on a timely basis our revenues and profits could be reduced and the reputation of our brand and our business could be materially adversely affected additionally remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant unplanned expenses 

customerfacing technology systems are an important part of our sales and marketing strategy and the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences 

through our continued information technology enhancements we are able to provide an improved overall shopping environment and an omnichannel experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers tablets smart phones and other mobile communication devices we use our websites tractorsupplycom and petsensecom  and our mobile application as both a sales channel for our products and as a method of providing product project and other relevant information to our customers to drive instore and online sales omnichannel retailing is continually evolving and expanding and we must effectively respond to changing customer expectations and new developments disruptions failures or other performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our instore and online business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers 

if we are unable to maintain or upgrade our management information systems and software programs or if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient and our longterm strategic growth initiatives may not be successful 

we depend on management information systems for many aspects of our business we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that we can continue to support our business we could be materially adversely affected if we experienced a disruption or data loss relating to our management information systems and are unable to recover timely we could also be adversely impacted if we are unable to improve upgrade maintain and expand our management information systems particularly in light of the contemplated continued store growth 

the success of our longterm strategic growth initiatives designed to increase our sales and improve margin are dependent in varying degrees on the timely delivery and the functionality of information technology systems to support them extended delays or cost overruns in securing developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support the longterm strategic growth initiatives would delay and possibly even prevent us from realizing the projected benefits of those initiatives 

financial risks 

changes in market conditions or in our credit rating could restrict capital and adversely affect our business operations and growth initiatives 

we rely on the positive cash flow we generate from our operating activities and our access to the credit and capital markets to fund our operations growth strategy capital expenditures and return of cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends changes in the credit and capital markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to these potential sources of future liquidity our continued access to liquidity sources on favorable terms depends on multiple factors including our operating performance and credit ratings there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain andor improve our current credit ratings a rating organization may lower our rating or change our ratings’ outlook or decide not to rate our securities temporarily or permanently in its sole discretion in the event that our current credit ratings are downgraded or removed we would most likely incur higher borrowing costs and experience greater difficulty in obtaining additional financing which in turn would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity we can make no assurances that our ability to obtain additional financing through the debt markets will not be adversely affected by economic conditions or that we will be able to maintain or improve our current credit ratings 

in addition tight lending practices may make it difficult for our real estate developers to obtain financing under acceptable loan terms and conditions unfavorable lending conditions could impact the timing of our store openings and materially adversely affect our ability to open new stores in desirable locations 

longerterm disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty changing or increased regulation reduced funding alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases cash dividends or other discretionary uses of cash 

our level of indebtedness could limit our cash flow available for operations and could adversely affect our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing 

as of december 26 2020 our total outstanding consolidated debt was approximately 9843 million our level of indebtedness could restrict our operations and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations our ability to make payments on our indebtedness to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control the risk exists that our business will be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity our ability to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all will be dependent upon a number of factors including our degree of leverage the value of our assets borrowing and other financial restrictions imposed by lenders and conditions in the credit markets at the time we refinance if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms we may be forced to agree to otherwise unfavorable financing terms this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition so long as we comply with any existing limitations in our credit and debt agreements while they are in effect we may issue an indeterminate amount of debt securities from time to time if new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries current debt levels the related risks that we and they now face could intensify 

our credit facilities the indenture related to our 175 senior notes and other debt instruments have restrictive covenants and change of control provisions that could limit our financial and business flexibility 

our credit agreement governing our senior credit facilities and our note purchase and private shelf agreement governing our senior unsecured notes due august 14 2029 the “2029 notes” each contain financial operative and other restrictive covenants in addition to the restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing our 175 senior notes as defined in the notes to the consolidated financial statements our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition in addition upon certain events constituting a change of control as that term is defined in the indenture for our 175 senior notes and in our note purchase and private shelf agreement for our 2029 notes we are required to make an offer in cash to repurchase all or any part of each holders 175 senior notes at a repurchase price equal to 101 of the principal thereof plus accrued interest and to prepay all of each holder’s 2029 notes at a prepayment price equal to 100 of the principal thereof plus accrued interest sufficient funds may not be available to us however at the time of any change of control event to repurchase and prepay as applicable all or a portion of the tendered notes pursuant to these requirements our failure to offer to repurchase 175 senior notes and prepay 2029 notes or to repurchase and prepay as applicable notes tendered following a change of control will result in a default under the indentures for our 175 senior notes and the note purchase and private shelf agreement for our 2029 notes which could lead to a crossdefault under our credit agreement for our senior credit facilities 

we cannot provide any guaranty of future dividend payments or that we will continue to repurchase our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program 

although our board of directors has indicated an intention to pay future quarterly cash dividends on our common stock any determination to pay or increase cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be based primarily upon our financial condition results of operations business requirements and our board of directors’ continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our stockholders and is in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the dividend furthermore although our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of up to 45 billion which has remaining authorization as of december 26 2020 of 114 billion we may temporarily pause or permanently discontinue this program at any time or significantly reduce the amount of repurchases under the program 

the market price for our common stock might be volatile and could result in a decline in value 

the price at which our common stock trades may be volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to our operating results general trends and prospects for the retail industry announcements by our competitors analyst recommendations our ability to meet or exceed analysts’ or investors’ expectations the condition of the financial markets and other factors the company’s stock price is dependent in part on the multiple of earnings that investors are willing to pay that multiple is in part dependent on investors’ perception of the company’s future earnings growth prospects if investors’ perception of the company’s earnings growth prospects change the company’s earnings multiple may decline and its stock price could be adversely affected 

in addition the stock market has at times experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies these fluctuations as well as general economic and market conditions may adversely affect the market price of our common stock notwithstanding our actual operating performance 

impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of an acquired company and the related fair value of net assets acquired a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indication of impairment of goodwill exists as with goodwill we also test our indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable factors indicating impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets may include among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a sustained significant 

decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated or changing competition the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit and reduced growth rates any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations to the extent that business conditions deteriorate or if changes in key assumptions and estimates differ significantly from managements expectations it may be necessary to record additional impairment charges in the future which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

legal regulatory and compliance risks 

we are subject to personal injury workers’ compensation product liability discrimination harassment wrongful termination wage and hour and other claims in the ordinary course of business

we are also subject to the foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” which prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business and the antibribery laws of other jurisdictions failure to comply with the fcpa and similar laws could subject us to among other things penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

potential noncompliance with environmental regulations could materially impact our results of operations or financial condition 

our business is subject to various federal state and local laws regulations and other requirements pertaining to protection of the environment and public health including for example regulations governing the management of waste materials and waste waters governmental agencies on the federal state and local levels have in recent years increasingly focused on the retail sector’s compliance with such laws and regulations and have at times pursued enforcement activities we periodically receive information requests and notices of potential noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations from governmental agencies which are addressed on a casebycase basis with the relevant agency any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business and results 

the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting an internal control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

effective tax rate changes and results of examinations by taxing authorities could materially impact our results 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by legislative tax reform changes in statutory rates or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof additionally our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the earnings mix being lower than historical results in states where we have lower statutory rates and higher than historical results in states where we have higher statutory rates or by changes in the measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 

we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the internal revenue service “irs” as well as state and local taxing authorities like many retailers a portion of our sales are to taxexempt customers the business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment these circumstances create risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance our results could be materially impacted by the determinations and expenses related to these and other proceedings by the irs and other state and local taxing authorities 

covid19 risks 

the covid19 coronavirus pandemic could have a material negative effect on our results of operations cash flows financial position and business operations 

the covid19 pandemic has created significant public health concerns as well as economic disruption uncertainty and volatility which may negatively affect our business operations 

we are unable to predict the impact that covid19 will have on our results of operations cash flows financial position and business operations due to numerous uncertainties these uncertainties include but are not limited to the severity of the virus the duration of the pandemic governmental actions which include restrictions on our operations up to and including potential closure of our stores and distribution centers the duration and degree of quarantine or shelterinplace measures including additional measures that may still occur impacts on our supply chain which include suppliers of our products and our transportation vendors the health of our workforce and our ability to maintain staffing needs to operate our business how macroeconomic factors evolve including unemployment rates and recessionary pressures the impact of the pandemic on consumer shopping patterns both during and after the pandemic volatility in the economy as well as the credit and financial markets during and after the pandemic the incremental costs of doing business during the pandemic as well as on a longterm basis potential increases in insurance premiums medical claims costs and workers compensation claim costs unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time and other resources to the pandemic response potential delays in growth initiatives including the timing of new store openings potential adverse 

effects on our internal control environment and information security as a result of changes to a remote work environment and the longterm impact of the pandemic on our business 

in addition we cannot predict the impact that the pandemic will have on our manufacturers and suppliers of our products and other business partners such as service vendors however any material effect on these parties could adversely impact our results of operations and our ability to operate our business effectively 

the covid19 coronavirus pandemic could have a material negative effect on our supply chain 

circumstances surrounding and related to the covid19 pandemic have created unprecedented impacts on the global supply chain our business relies on an efficient and effective supply chain including the manufacture and transportation of our products as well as the effective functioning of our distribution centers impacts related to the covid19 pandemic are placing strains on the domestic and international supply chains that could negatively affect the flow or availability of our products and result in higher outofstock inventory positions due to difficulties in timely obtaining product from the manufacturers and suppliers of our products as well as transportation of those products to our distribution centers and stores further we may have to source products from different manufacturers or geographic locations which could result in among other things higher product costs increased transportation costs delays in receiving products or lower quality of the products 

additionally the operation of our distribution centers is crucial to our business operations if our distribution centers experience closures or worker shortages whether temporary or sustained we could sustain significant adverse impacts related to the flow or availability of products to our stores and customers 

any of these circumstances could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales increased supply chain costs or damage to our reputation 

economic impacts stemming from the covid19 coronavirus pandemic could significantly impact our financial position including liquidity capital allocation and access to capital markets for additional funds to operate our business 

in an effort to strengthen and preserve our liquidity while navigating the covid19 pandemic we took preemptive actions including incremental borrowings under our credit facilities issuing 6500 million of 1750 senior notes as defined in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements temporary suspension of our share repurchase program during a portion of fiscal 2020 and increased our balance of cash and cash equivalents 

the increased debt levels have increased our interest expense costs and could place us at higher risk of default or limit our future financial flexibility further the financial and credit markets have and may continue to experience significant volatility and turmoil whether due to our increased debt levels or to ongoing changes in the financial and credit markets our ability to access capital on favorable terms and continue to meet our liquidity needs could be adversely affected 

additionally changes in our capital allocation strategy could have significant adverse impacts both short and longterm on our business results of operations and financial position any future suspension of our share repurchase program if necessary and depending on duration will negatively impact our earnings per share which in turn could adversely impact our common stock price while not contemplated at this time any potential suspension or reduction in our dividend declaration could have an adverse impact on investor perception and our common stock price 

actions taken to protect the health and safety of our team members and customers during the covid19 coronavirus pandemic have increased our operating costs and may not be sufficient to protect against operational or reputational harm to our business regulatory actions or claims and litigation 

in response to the covid19 pandemic we have taken a number of actions across our business to help protect our team members customers and others in the communities we serve these measures include personal protective equipment for our team members a requirement to wear masks in our facilities increased staffing in order to provide contactfree curbside pickup from stores expansion of our capabilities to support delivery to customer homes increased cleaning and sanitizing measures and monitoring for “social distancing” directives as well as additional cleaning materials in our facilities additionally we have provided appreciation bonuses as well as permanent increases in compensation and benefits for our team members in our stores and distribution centers to further support them during and after the covid19 pandemic actions such as these have resulted in significant incremental costs and we expect that we will continue to incur these costs for the foreseeable future which in turn will have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

the health and safety of our team members and customers are of primary concern to our management team however due to the unpredictable nature of this virus and the consequences of our actions we may see unexpected outcomes notwithstanding our added safety measures for instance if we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic or if our team members or customers do not participate in “social distancing” vaccination efforts and other safety measures the wellbeing of our team members and customers could be jeopardized furthermore any failure to appropriately respond or the perception of an inadequate response could cause reputational harm to our brand and subject us to claims and litigation from team members customers and service providers additionally we may experience increased litigation expenses resulting from team member or customer lawsuits including those related to the company’s covid19 response and team member or customer contraction of covid19 increased insurance costs medical claims costs and workers’ compensation claims costs and an adverse impact of regulatory and judicial changes in liability for workers’ compensation claims related to the covid19 pandemic 

further an outbreak of confirmed cases of covid19 in our stores or distribution centers could result in temporary or sustained workforce shortages or facility closures which would negatively impact our underlying business and results of operations

over the past five years we have experienced considerable growth in stores growing from 1488 stores at the end of fiscal 2015 to 2105 stores 1923 tractor supply and del’s retail stores and 182 petsense retail stores at the end of fiscal 2020 and in net sales with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 113 given the size of the communities that we target we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in many existing and new markets we have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and we believe we have significant additional opportunities for new tractor supply stores we also believe that there is opportunity for continued growth for petsense stores 

executive summary 

in fiscal 2020 we opened 80 new tractor supply stores in 31 states and nine new petsense stores in three states in fiscal 2019 we opened 80 new tractor supply stores in 29 states and eight new petsense stores in four states this resulted in a selling square footage increase of approximately 4 in each of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 

net sales increased 272 to 1062 billion in fiscal 2020 from 835 billion in fiscal 2019 as we experienced significant demand for our products across all product categories geographies and channels in fiscal 2020 as our customers focused on the care of their homes land and animals while navigating the covid19 pandemic comparable store sales increased 231 in fiscal 2020 versus a 27 increase in fiscal 2019 gross profit increased 310 to 376 billion in fiscal 2020 from 287 billion in fiscal 2019 and gross margin increased 104 basis points to 3542 of net sales in fiscal 2020 from 3438 of net sales in fiscal 2019 operating income increased 49 basis points to 939 of net sales in fiscal 2020 from 890 of net sales in fiscal 2019 for fiscal 2020 net income was 7490 million or 638 per diluted share compared to 5624 million or 466 per diluted share in fiscal 2019 

we ended fiscal 2020 with 134 billion in cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt of 9843 million after returning 5176 million to our stockholders through stock repurchases and quarterly cash dividends 

information regarding covid19 coronavirus pandemic 

the company has been and continues to closely monitor the impact of the covid19 pandemic on all facets of our business this includes the impact on our team members customers suppliers vendors business partners and supply chain networks 

the health and safety of our team members and customers are the primary concerns of our management team we have taken and continue to take numerous actions to promote health and safety including providing personal protective equipment to our team members establishing mask protocols in our facilities rolling out additional functionality to support contactless shopping experiences adding services for cleaning and sanitation in our stores and distribution centers hiring additional team members to assist in promoting social distancing and cleaning actions in our stores and implementing remote work plans at our store support center 

additionally we have taken significant actions to support our team members during this pandemic including covid19 paid medical leave 100 coverage of covid19 testing and treatment under our medical plan and the payment of incremental appreciation bonuses for frontline team members of approximately 44 million during fiscal 2020 effective june 28 2020 we implemented permanent wage increases for all of our hourly team members in our stores and distribution centers of a minimum of 1 per hour and are now providing a new benefit package for parttime team members including medical vision and dental coverage behavioral health services paid sick time and life insurance we have also implemented annual restricted stock unit grants to more than 2000 frontline salaried managers in our stores and distribution centers 

as further described in the results of operations our net sales have significantly increased due to unprecedented customer demand across all major product categories channels and geographic regions however the net incremental costs of doing business during this crisis have increased as a result of the aforementioned actions we have taken to support and promote the safety and wellbeing of our team members and customers and we believe many of these incremental costs will continue after the pandemic is over 

there are numerous uncertainties surrounding the pandemic and its impact on the economy and our business as further described in the risk factors section under part i item 1a of this form 10k which make it difficult to predict the impact on our business financial position or results of operations in fiscal 2021 and beyond while our stores distribution centers and ecommerce operations are open and plan to remain open we cannot predict the uncertainties or the corresponding impacts on our business at this time 

comparable store metrics 

comparable store metrics are a key performance indicator used in the retail industry and by the company to measure the performance of the underlying business comparable store metrics are calculated on an annual basis using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales excluding certain adjustments to net sales stores closed during the year are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations stores relocated during the years being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics if the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics becomes material we would remove relocated stores from the calculations 

significant accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our financial position andor results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 

inventory valuation 

inventory impairment 

we identify potentially excess and slowmoving inventory by evaluating turn rates historical and expected future sales trends age of merchandise overall inventory levels current cost of inventory and other benchmarks we have established an inventory valuation reserve to recognize the estimated impairment in value ie an inability to realize the full carrying value based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies 

we do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term however changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves our impairment reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding forecasted customer demand and the promotional environment 

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize inventory impairment reserves in the financial periods presented we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate impairment however if assumptions regarding consumer demand or clearance potential for certain products are inaccurate we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material a 10 change in our inventory impairment reserve as of december 26 2020 would have affected net income by approximately 11 million in fiscal 2020 

shrinkage 

our general policy is to perform physical inventories at least once a year for each store that has been open more than 12 months and we have established a reserve for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts the reserve is established by assessing the chainwide average shrinkage experience rate applied to the related periods’ sales volumes such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences 

while the company continued to operate as an essential retailer during the year the covid19 pandemic had a direct impact on our ability to complete all originally planned store physical inventories in fiscal 2020 our plan was complicated by state and local mandates such as shelter at home restrictions and social distancing requirements our decision to revise our inventory schedule was based on these mandates as well as consideration of the health and safety of our team members customers and vendor partners which are crucial to our business operations 

we assessed the risks associated with the stores not inventoried and concluded there is no material risk of misstatement to the financial statements for the stores not inventoried and further concluded that effective compensating controls are in place to ensure completeness and accuracy of reported inventory balances and estimated shrink losses 

the estimated store inventory shrink rate is based on historical experience we believe historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends our shrinkage reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding future shrinkage trends the effect of loss prevention measures and merchandising strategies 

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize shrinkage in the financial periods presented we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our shrinkage reserve however if our estimates regarding inventory losses are inaccurate we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material a 10 change in our shrinkage reserve as of december 26 2020 would have affected net income by approximately 29 million in fiscal 2020 

vendor funding 

we receive funding from substantially all of our significant merchandise vendors in support of our business initiatives through a variety of programs and arrangements including guaranteed vendor support funds “vendor support” and volumebased rebate funds “volume rebates” the amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements most of which are “evergreen” reflecting the ongoing relationship with our significant merchandise vendors certain of our agreements primarily volume rebates are renegotiated annually based on expected annual purchases of the vendor’s product vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold during interim periods the amount of vendor support and volume rebates are estimated based upon initial commitments and anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors 

the estimated purchase volume and related vendor funding is based on our current knowledge of inventory levels sales trends and expected customer demand as well as planned new store openings and relocations although we believe we can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related volume rebates at interim periods it is possible that actual yearend results could be different from previously estimated amounts our allocation methodology contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding customer demand purchasing activity target thresholds vendor attrition and collectability 

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our vendor funding reserves in the financial periods presented at the end of each fiscal year a significant portion of the actual purchase activity is known thus we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the amounts recorded as vendor funding we do not believe there is a significant collectability risk related to vendor funding amounts due to us at the end of fiscal 2020 if a 10 reserve had been applied against our outstanding vendor funding due as of december 26 2020 net income would have been affected by approximately 16 million in fiscal 2020 although it is unlikely that there will be any significant reduction in historical levels of vendor funding if such a reduction were to occur in future periods the company could experience a higher inventory balance and higher cost of sales 

freight 

we incur various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases and distribution such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories on an aggregate basis and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold 

we allocate freight as a component of total cost of sales without regard to inventory mix or unique freight burden of certain categories this assumption has been consistently applied for all years presented 

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our capitalized freight balance or freight allocation in the financial periods presented if a 10 increase or decrease had been applied against our current inventory capitalized freight balance as of december 26 2020 net income would have been affected by approximately 117 million in fiscal 2020 

selfinsurance reserves 

we selfinsure a significant portion of our workers’ compensation insurance and general liability including product liability insurance plans we have stoploss insurance policies to protect from individual losses over specified dollar values provisions for losses related to our selfinsured liabilities are based upon periodic independent actuarially determined estimates that consider a number of factors including historical claims experience loss development factors and severity factors 

the full extent of certain workers’ compensation and general liability claims may not become fully determined for several years our selfinsured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date based upon historical data and experience including actuarial calculations 

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our selfinsurance reserves in the financial periods presented we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the assumptions we use to calculate insurance reserves however if we experience a significant increase in the number of claims or the cost associated with these claims we may be exposed to losses that could be material a 10 change in our selfinsurance reserves as of december 26 2020 would have affected net income by approximately 59 million in fiscal 2020 

impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets including lease assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable when evaluating longlived assets for potential impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows the evaluation for longlived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is generally the individual store level the significant assumptions used to determine estimated undiscounted cash flows include cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations including margin on net sales payroll and related items occupancy costs insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the related asset we calculate an impairment loss the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the related asset or asset group to its estimated fair value which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model market valuation or other valuation technique as appropriate we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset’s carrying value exceeds the asset’s estimated fair value if we recognize an impairment loss the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis for a depreciable longlived asset the new cost basis will be depreciated amortized over the remaining estimated useful life of that asset 

our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values 

we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology in the financial periods presented other than to include operating lease rightofuse assets in our ongoing impairment assessment upon adoption of the new lease accounting standard in fiscal 2019 

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate longlived asset impairment losses none of these estimates and assumptions are significantly sensitive and a 10 change in any of these estimates would not have a material impact on our analysis however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to losses that could be material we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology in the financial periods presented in fiscal 2020 we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate longlived asset impairment losses 

in fiscal 2020 we recognized approximately 51 million of impairment expense related to longlived assets for certain underperforming petsense stores 

impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with the accounting standards an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill or an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if after such assessment an entity concludes that the asset is not impaired then the entity is not required to take further action however if an entity concludes otherwise then it is required to determine the fair value of the asset using a quantitative impairment test and if impaired the associated assets must be written down to fair value 

the quantitative impairment test for goodwill compares the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying value of its net assets including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit an impairment charge would be recorded to the company’s operations for the amount in which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value we determine fair values for each reporting unit using the market approach when available and appropriate the income approach or a combination of both the income approach involves forecasting projected financial information such as revenue growth rates profit margins tax rates and capital expenditures and selecting a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in estimated future cash flows under the market approach the fair value is based on observed market data if multiple valuation methodologies are used the results are weighted appropriately 

the quantitative impairment test for other indefinitelived intangible assets involves comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of the discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the implied fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than the carrying value an impairment charge would be recorded to the company’s operations 

our impairment loss calculation contains uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to qualitative factors as well as estimate future cash flows and asset fair values including forecasting projected financial information and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

the valuation approaches utilized to estimate fair value for the purposes of the impairment tests of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets require the use of assumptions and estimates which involve a degree of uncertainty if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to noncash impairment losses that could be material 

as described in further detail in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2020 we recognized goodwill impairment expense of approximately 608 million and tradename asset impairment expense of approximately 82 million related to petsense 

quarterly financial data 

our unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2020 and 2019 are shown below in thousands except per share amounts 





a comparable store metrics are calculated using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales excluding certain adjustments to net sales closed stores are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations stores relocated during the periods being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics if the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics becomes material we would remove relocated stores from the calculations

net sales increased 272 to 1062 billion in fiscal 2020 from 835 billion in fiscal 2019 comparable store sales increased 231 to 1029 billion versus a 27 increase in fiscal 2019 the comparable store average transaction value increased 122 and comparable store average transaction count increased 109 for fiscal 2020 as compared to an increase of 24 and 03 in fiscal 2019 respectively 

the covid19 pandemic had a significant positive impact on consumer demand in fiscal 2020 as customers focused on the care of their homes land and animals all major product categories and geographic regions of the company had robust comparable store sales growth the increase in comparable store sales was driven by unprecedented demand beginning late in the first quarter and extending throughout the year for seasonal categories along with exceptional growth in everyday merchandise including consumable usable and edible cue products in addition the company’s ecommerce sales experienced tripledigit percentage growth in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 

in addition to comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2020 sales from stores opened less than one year were 3553 million in fiscal 2020 which represented 43 percentage points of the 272 increase over fiscal 2019 net sales sales from stores opened less than one year were 2376 million in fiscal 2019 which represented 30 percentage points of the 56 increase over fiscal 2018 net sales 

the following table summarizes our store growth during fiscal 2020 and 2019 



the following table indicates the percentage of net sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2020 and 2019 



gross profit increased 310 to 376 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to 287 billion in fiscal 2019 as a percent of net sales gross margin increased 104 basis points to 3542 for fiscal 2020 compared to 3438 for fiscal 2019 the increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to the strong demand for our products resulting in a lower depth and frequency of sales promotions and less clearance activity 

total selling general and administrative “sga” expenses including depreciation and amortization and asset impairment increased 299 to 276 billion in fiscal 2020 from 213 billion in fiscal 2019 sga expenses as a percent of net sales increased 55 basis points to 2603 in fiscal 2020 from 2548 in fiscal 2019 the sga expenses in fiscal 2020 were impacted by discrete noncash impairment charges for the petsense business of 741 million due primarily to a strategic reassessment of the business and a decision to reduce the number of new store openings planned over the long term and to a lesser extent the impairment of longlived assets at underperforming locations in fiscal 2020 we also experienced incremental costs related to the covid19 pandemic increased incentive compensation given the company’s strong financial performance investments in our team members through permanent wage and benefit increases for our store and distribution center team members that went into effect in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and costs associated with investments in strategic initiatives the costs related to the covid19 pandemic were approximately 117 million during fiscal 2020 which includes appreciation wages for frontline team members as well as additional labor hours and supply costs dedicated to cleaning and sanitation to promote the health and safety of team members and customers these increased costs including the impairment expense drove an increase in our sga expenses as a percent of net sales in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 these increases as a percent of net sales were partially offset by leverage in occupancy personnel and other operating costs from the significant increase in comparable store sales 

our effective income tax rate increased to 226 for fiscal 2020 compared to 223 in fiscal 2019 the primary driver for the increase in the company’s effective income tax rate was attributable to a reduction in the benefit from investment credits as well as section 162m limitations partially offset by an improvement in the benefit from sharebased compensation 

net income in fiscal 2020 was 74896 million or 638 per diluted share compared to 56235 million or 466 per diluted share in fiscal 2019 the aforementioned noncash impairment expense related to the petsense business had an aftertax impact on fiscal 2020 net income of approximately 5729 million or 049 per diluted share on an adjusted basis considering the aftertax impact of the noncash impairment charges related to the petsense business net income was 80624 million or 687 per diluted share for fiscal 2020 adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are nongaap measures which have been provided in order to enhance comparability for the periods presented given that the impairment charges related to the petsense business are nonrecurring in nature a reconciliation of these nongaap financial measures is included in the following table 



during fiscal 2020 we repurchased approximately 34 million shares of the company’s common stock at a total cost of 3430 million as part of our share repurchase program in fiscal 2019 we repurchased approximately 54 million shares at a total cost of 5333 million shares repurchased in fiscal 2020 were impacted by the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program from march 12 2020 until november 5 2020 in order to strengthen our liquidity and preserve cash while navigating the covid19 pandemic 

fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 

for a comparison of our performance and financial metrics for the fiscal years ended december 28 2019 and december 29 2018 see “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 28 2019 filed with the sec on february 20 2020 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

in addition to normal operating expenses our primary ongoing cash requirements are for new store expansion remodeling and relocation programs distribution facility capacity and improvements information technology inventory purchases repayment of existing borrowings under our debt facilities share repurchases cash dividends and selective acquisitions as opportunities arise 

our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are existing cash balances cash provided from operations remaining funds available under our debt facilities operating and finance leases and normal trade credit our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters to support the higher sales volume of the spring and coldweather selling seasons respectively 

we believe that our existing cash balances expected cash flow from future operations funds available under our debt facilities operating and finance leases and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations including increased expenses associated with covid19 and our capital expenditure needs including new store openings store acquisitions relocations and renovations distribution facility capacity and information technology improvements through the end of fiscal 2021 

working capital 

at december 26 2020 the company had working capital of 151 billion which increased 9746 million from 2019 the shifts in working capital were attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities in millions 



in comparison to december 28 2019 working capital as of december 26 2020 was impacted most significantly by changes in cash and cash equivalents inventories accounts payable and accrued expenses 

• the increase in cash and cash equivalents was driven by significant net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2020 and an increase in borrowings net of repayments under our debt facilities as we sought to strengthen liquidity and preserve cash while navigating the covid19 pandemic these increases in cash and cash equivalents were partially offset by share repurchases capital expenditures to support our strategic growth and cash dividends paid to stockholders 

• the increase in inventories resulted from both a modest increase in average inventory per store to support the strong sales performance in the business as well as the purchase of additional inventory to support new store growth 

• the increase in accounts payable was driven by company growth including the significant increase in overall inventory as well as strong comparable store sales during fiscal 2020 the company growth and sales performance drove an increase in inventory purchases and produced high inventory turns resulting in an increase in the amount of inventory purchases that remain in accounts payable at year end as compared to last year 

• other accrued expenses increased as a result of company growth and the timing of payments the increase in accrued employee compensation was primarily due to incentive accruals given the strong financial performance in fiscal 2020 

debt 

the following table summarizes the company’s outstanding debt as of the dates indicated in millions 



on october 30 2020 the company issued and sold in a public offering 650 million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due november 1 2030 bearing interest at 175 per annum the “175 senior notes” in support of the issuance of the 175 senior notes we obtained credit ratings from moodys investor services and standard  poors

our current ratings as well as future rating agency actions could impact our ability to finance our operations on satisfactory terms and affect our financing costs there can be no assurance that we will maintain or improve our current credit ratings 

for additional information about the company’s debt and credit facilities refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements as further described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to hedge our exposure to variable rate interest payments associated term loans under the senior credit facility 

sources and uses of cash 

our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and funds available under our debt facilities principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures while principal uses of cash for financing activities are repurchase of the company’s common stock and cash dividends paid to stockholders 

the following table presents a summary of cash flows provided by or used in operating investing and financing activities for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 in millions 



operating activities 

operating activities provided net cash of 139 billion and 8117 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively the 5828 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was due to changes in the following in millions 



the 5828 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 is primarily driven by a yearoveryear increase in our net income as well as the net impact of changes in our operating assets and liabilities principally due to significant company growth in fiscal 2020 as well as the timing of accruals and related payments the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was also affected by noncash impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2020 related to the petsense business 

investing activities 

investing activities used cash of 2922 million and 2150 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively cash flows from investing activities in the years presented are primarily composed of capital expenditures capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 and 2019 were as follows in millions 



the spending on information technology represents continued support of our store growth and our omnichannel initiatives as well as improvements in security and compliance enhancements to our customer relationship management program and other strategic initiatives in fiscal 2020 we additionally prioritized information technology capital expenditures to accelerate initiatives to enhance safety and convenience for customers including initiatives such as buy online pickup in store buy online deliver from store contactless curbside pickup contactless payment capabilities additional mobile pos devices in all stores and improvements to our instore wireless internet 

spending for existing stores includes routine refresh activity however the increased spend for existing stores in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was driven by strategic initiatives in select stores including security enhancements space productivity and side lot improvements 

the above table reflects an investment in 80 new tractor supply stores nine new petsense stores and one store relocation during fiscal 2020 in fiscal 2019 we opened 80 new tractor supply stores eight new petsense stores and had two store relocations 

spending for distribution center capacity and improvements in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 represents new equipment and various enhancements for existing facilities the northeast distribution center in frankfort new york was completed and began shipping merchandise to our stores in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 

our projected capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 are currently estimated to be in a range of approximately 450 million to 550 million the capital expenditures include a plan to open approximately 80 new tractor supply stores and 10 new petsense stores additionally we plan to begin construction in fiscal 2021 on a new distribution center in navarre ohio which is currently anticipated to be complete by the end of fiscal 2022 we also plan to support our strategic growth initiatives related to space productivity and side lot improvements in certain existing stores as well as continued improvements in technology and infrastructure at our existing stores and ongoing investments to enhance our digital and omnichannel capabilities to better serve our customers

the increase in net cash from financing activities in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 reflects an increase in net borrowings discussed further in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements and a reduction of repurchases of common stock both of which were the result of an effort throughout fiscal 2020 to increase liquidity and preserve cash while navigating the covid19 pandemic these increases in net cash provided yearoveryear were partially offset by increased quarterly cash dividends and a decrease in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock associated with the exercise of sharebased compensation awards 

repurchase of common stock 

the company’s board of directors has authorized common stock repurchases under a share repurchase program which was announced in february 2007 the authorization amount of the program which has been increased from time to time is currently authorized for up to 45 billion exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses related to such repurchases the share repurchase program does not have an expiration date the repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions the timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend 

on a variety of factors including price corporate and regulatory requirements capital availability and other market conditions repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance the program may be limited temporarily paused or terminated at any time without prior notice as of december 26 2020 the company had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of 114 billion exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses 

we repurchased approximately 34 million and 54 million shares of common stock under the share repurchase program at a total cost of 3430 million and 5333 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively as of december 26 2020 the company had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of 114 billion exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses shares repurchased in fiscal 2020 were impacted by the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program from march 12 2020 until november 5 2020 in order to strengthen our liquidity and preserve cash while navigating the covid19 pandemic 

cash dividends paid to stockholders 

we paid cash dividends totaling 1747 million and 1627 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively in fiscal 2020 we declared and paid cash dividends to stockholders of 150 per common share outstanding as compared to 136 per common share outstanding in fiscal 2019 respectively these payments reflect an increase in the quarterly dividend in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 to 040 per share from 035 per share and an increase in the quarterly dividend in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 from 031 per share 

on january 27 2021 the company’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 052 per share of the company’s outstanding common stock the dividend will be paid on march 9 2021 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on february 22 2021 

it is the present intention of the company’s board of directors to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend however the declaration and payment of future dividends will be determined by the company’s board of directors in its sole discretion and will depend upon the earnings financial condition and capital needs of the company along with any other factors which the company’s board of directors deem relevant 

significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of december 26 2020 in thousands 



a operating lease payments exclude  1741 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced 

b operating and finance lease obligations both include related interest 

c longterm debt obligations include an estimate of related interest after consideration of the interest rate swap agreements see notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our interest rates 

at december 26 2020 there were 487 million outstanding letters of credit under the senior credit facility 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements are limited to lease agreements signed but not yet commenced and outstanding letters of credit the balances for these arrangements are previously discussed letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory primarily sourced overseas in a timely manner and support certain risk management programs 

new accounting pronouncements 

the company adopted new lease accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 which had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets and related disclosures for additional information including the required disclosures related to the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance see note 1 and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued pronouncements not yet adopted as of december 26 2020 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of borrowings under our senior credit facility as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements which bear interest based on variable rates 

as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements we entered into interest rate swap agreements which are intended to mitigate interest rate risk associated with future changes in interest rates for the term loan borrowings under the senior credit facility as a result of the interest rate swaps our exposure to interest rate volatility is minimized the interest rate swap agreements have been executed for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposes 

a 1 change in interest rates on our variable rate debt in excess of that amount covered by the interest rate swaps would have affected interest expense by approximately 24 million 19 million and 16 million in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively based on the amount of outstanding variable rate debt as of december 26 2020 excluding those borrowings for which we have interest rate swaps a 1 change in interest rates would not result in any material increase in our interest expense on a prospective basis 

purchase price volatility 

although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items grain corn steel petroleum cotton and other commodities as well as duties tariffs diesel fuel and transportation services therefore we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost which may impact consumer demand and as a result sales and gross margin our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale from increased volume of purchases adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality

achieving this strategy will require a foundational focus on 1 organizing optimizing and empowering our team members for growth by developing skills talent and leadership across the organization and 2 implementing operational efficiency initiatives including leverage of technology and automation to align our cost structure to support new business capabilities for margin improvement and cost reductions 

over the past five years we have experienced considerable sales growth resulting in a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 79 we plan to open approximately 80 new tractor supply and 10 to 15 new petsense stores in fiscal 2020 a selling square footage increase of approximately 45 in fiscal 2019 we opened 80 new tractor supply stores and 8 new petsense stores in fiscal 2018 we opened 80 new tractor supply stores and 18 new petsense stores this represents a selling square footage increase of approximately 43 during fiscal 2019 and 49 during fiscal 2018 

at december 28 2019 we operated 2024 retail stores in 49 states 1844 tractor supply and del’s retail stores and 180 petsense retail stores given the size of the communities that we target we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in many existing and new markets we have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 600 additional markets for new tractor supply stores we also believe that there is opportunity for up to 1000 petsense stores approximately 55 of our stores are in freestanding buildings and 45 are located in strip shopping centers we lease approximately 94 of our stores and own the remaining 6 

competition 

we operate in a competitive retail industry the principal competitive factors include location of stores fulfillment options price quality of merchandise instock inventory consistency merchandise assortment and presentation product knowledge online competitors and customer service we compete with general merchandise retailers home center retailers pet retailers specialty and discount retailers independently owned retail farm and ranch stores numerous privatelyheld regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives as well as internetbased retailers however we believe we successfully differentiate ourselves from many of these retailers by focusing on our specialized market niche for customers living the rural lifestyle see further discussion of competition in 1a “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10k 

seasonality and weather 

our business is seasonal historically our sales and profits are the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products we experience our highest inventory and accounts payable balances during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal products to support the higher sales volume of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter to support the higher sales volume of the coldweather selling season we believe that our business can be more accurately assessed by focusing on the performance of the halves not the quarters due to the fact that different weather patterns from yeartoyear can shift the timing of sales and profits between quarters particularly between the first and second fiscal quarters and the third and fourth fiscal quarters 

historically weather conditions including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and unseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months have affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations in addition extreme weather conditions including snow and ice storms flood and wind damage hurricanes tornadoes extreme rain and droughts have impacted operating results both negatively and positively depending on the severity and length of these conditions our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends 

stewardship and compliance with environmental matters 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment we are committed to complying with all applicable environmental laws and regulations we are also committed to becoming a more environmentally sustainable company this commitment is demonstrated through our stewardship program which is our environmental sustainability program through this program the company has implemented a number of initiatives designed to reduce our impact on the environment these initiatives include the installation of energy management systems led lighting high efficiency heatingair conditioning systems and recycling programs in our stores distribution facilities and store support center our store support center and our distribution centers in casa grande arizona and frankfort new york are leed leadership in energy and environmental design silver certified for environmentally sustainable design construction and operation we also installed solar arrays at the store support center in brentwood tennessee and our tractor supply store in hendersonville tennessee 

in december 2018 we announced a goal to reduce carbon emissions from our facilities by 25 by 2025 from our 2015 baseline as part of the companys stewardship program

 item 1a  risk factors 

our business faces many risks those risks of which we are currently aware and deem to be material are described below if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur our business financial condition or results of operations may significantly suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this form 10k 

general economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance 

our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending including discretionary spending a weakening of economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as lower employment levels uncertainty or changes in business or political conditions higher interest rates higher tax rates higher fuel and energy costs higher labor and healthcare costs the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism general health epidemics and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to competitors a general reduction in the level of discretionary spending shifts in consumer discretionary spending to our competitors or shifts in discretionary spending to less profitable products sold by us could result in lower net sales slower inventory turnover greater markdowns on inventory and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins 

failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name or any of our exclusive brands 

our success depends in part on the value and strength of the tractor supply name including our exclusive brands the tractor supply name is integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business maintaining promoting and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide high quality merchandise and a consistent high quality customer experience our brand could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity failure to comply or accusation of failure to comply with ethical social product labor data privacy and environmental standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions any of these events could result in decreased revenue or otherwise adversely affect our business 

we may be unable to increase sales at our existing stores 

we experience fluctuations in our comparable store sales at our existing stores defined as sales in stores which have been open for at least twelve months various factors affect the comparable store sales at our existing stores including among others the general retail sales environment our ability to efficiently source and distribute products changes in our merchandise assortment competition proximity of our locations to one another or to the locations of other competing retailers increased presence of online retailers current economic conditions customer satisfaction with our products retail pricing the timing of promotional events the release of new merchandise the success of marketing programs and weather conditions these factors may cause the comparable store sales results at our existing stores to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations past comparable store sales are not an indication of future results and there can be no assurance that our comparable store sales will not decrease in the future 

purchase price volatility including inflationary and deflationary pressures may adversely affect our financial performance 

although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items grain corn steel petroleum cotton and other commodities as well as duties tariffs diesel fuel and transportation services therefore we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost which may impact consumer demand and as a result sales and gross margin our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale from increased volume of purchases adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors while maintaining product quality should our strategy to mitigate purchase price volatility not be effective our financial performance could be adversely impacted 

weather conditions may have a significant impact on our financial results 

weather conditions affect the demand for and in some cases the supply of products which in turn has an impact on prices historically weather conditions including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and unseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months have affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations in addition extreme weather conditions including snow and ice storms flood and wind damage hurricanes tornadoes extreme rain and droughts have impacted operating results while extreme weather conditions can positively impact our operating results by increasing demand in affected locations for products needed to cope with the weather condition and its effects they can also negatively affect our business depending on the severity and length of these conditions as a result of store closings damage to our stores or merchandise or the inability of customers to shop at our stores due to weather conditions our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends should such a strategy not be effective the weather may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our merchandising and marketing initiatives may not provide expected results 

we believe our past performance has been based on and future success will depend upon in part the ability to develop and execute merchandising initiatives with effective marketing programs these merchandising initiatives and marketing programs may not deliver expected results and there is no assurance that we will correctly identify and respond in a timely manner to evolving trends and consumer preferences and expectations further adverse publicity about our merchandise products whether valid or not may discourage consumers from buying the products we offer if we misjudge the market or our marketing programs are not successful we may overstock unpopular products and be forced to take inventory impairment or retail price reductions that have a material adverse effect on our profitability failure to execute and promote such initiatives in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow the business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition shortages of key merchandise could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

capital required for growth may not be available 

the construction or acquisition of new stores store support center facilities distribution facilities or other facilities the remodeling and renovation of existing facilities and investments in information technology require significant amounts of capital in the past our growth has been funded through internally generated cash flow and bank borrowings our failure to generate expected cash flow could impair our growth in addition disruptions to the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the ability of the banks to meet their commitments our access to funds under our debt facilities is dependent on the 

ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time in addition tight lending practices may make it difficult for our real estate developers to obtain financing under acceptable loan terms and conditions unfavorable lending conditions could impact the timing of our store openings and materially adversely affect our ability to open new stores in desirable locations 

longerterm disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty changing or increased regulation reduced funding alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases cash dividends or other discretionary uses of cash 

failure to open and manage new stores in the number and manner currently contemplated could adversely affect our financial 

performance 

an integral part of our business strategy includes the expansion of our store base through new store openings this expansion strategy is dependent on our ability to find suitable locations and we face competition from many retailers and other businesses for such sites if we are unable to implement this strategy our ability to increase our sales profitability and cash flow could be impaired significantly to the extent that we are unable to open new stores in the manner we anticipate due to among other reasons site approval or unforeseen delays in construction our sales growth may be impeded 

as we execute this expansion strategy we may also experience managerial or operational challenges which may prevent any expected increase in sales profitability or cash flow our ability to manage our planned expansion depends on the adequacy of our existing information systems the efficiency and expansion of our distribution systems the adequacy of the hiring and training process for new personnel especially store managers the effectiveness of our controls and procedures and the ability to identify customer demand and build market awareness in different geographic areas there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our planned expansion that the new stores will be effectively integrated into our existing operations or that such stores will be profitable 

although we have a rigorous real estate site selection and approval process there can be no assurance that our new store openings will be successful or result in incremental sales and profitability for the company new stores build their sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection over time and as a result generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our more mature stores as we continue to open new stores there may be a negative impact on our results from a lower contribution margin of these new stores until their sales levels ramp to chain average if at all as well as from the impact of related preopening costs additionally new stores can also impact the sales and contribution margins of existing stores located in close proximity 

our failure to attract and retain qualified team members increases in wage and labor costs and changes in laws and other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to maintain and continue expanding operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified team members our ability to meet labor needs while controlling wage and related labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force unemployment levels prevailing wage rates increases in legally required minimum wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs changes in employment legislation and the potential for changes in local labor practices or union activities if we are unable to locate attract or retain qualified personnel or if costs of labor or related costs increase significantly our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we are subject to federal state and local laws governing employment practices and working conditions these laws cover wage and hour practices labor relations paid and family leave workplace safety and immigration among others the laws and regulations being passed at the state and local level create unique challenges for a multistate employer we must continue to monitor and adapt our employment practices to comply with these various laws and regulations if our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly as new or revised labor laws rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented our financial performance could be adversely affected 

the loss of current members of our senior management team and other key team members or the failure to successfully manage an executive officer transition may adversely affect our operating results 

our success depends in large part on the continued availability and service of our executive officers senior management and other key team members competition for senior management and key team members in our industry is strong and we may not be able to retain our key team members or attract new qualified team members we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other team members sufficiently both to maintain our current business and to execute our longterm strategic growth initiatives the loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management without sufficient advance notice could prevent or delay the implementation and completion of our strategic initiatives or divert management’s attention to seeking qualified replacements additionally any failure by us to manage a successful leadership transition of an executive officer and to timely identify a qualified permanent replacement could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may pursue strategic acquisitions and the failure of an acquisition to produce the anticipated results or the inability to fully integrate the acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business 

we may from time to time acquire businesses we believe to be complementary to our business the success of an acquisition is based on our ability to make accurate assumptions regarding the valuation operations growth potential integration and other factors relating to the target business acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and may result in the diversion of our capital and our management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities we may not be able to successfully integrate an organization that we acquire including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures if we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions we could experience increased costs associated with operating inefficiencies which could have an adverse effect on our financial results also while we employ several different methodologies to assess potential business opportunities the new businesses may not meet our expectations and therefore adversely affect our financial performance 

competition may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations 

we operate in the highly competitive retail merchandise sector with numerous competitors these competitors include general merchandise retailers home center retailers specialty and discount retailers independentlyowned retail farm and ranch stores numerous privatelyheld regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives as well as internetbased retailers we compete for customers merchandise real estate locations and employees this competitive environment subjects us to various other risks including the inability to continue our store and sales growth and to provide attractive merchandise to our customers at competitive prices that allow us to maintain our profitability our failure to compete effectively in this environment could adversely impact our financial performance 

we face risks from our use of service providers or other thirdparties whom we rely upon for conducting our business 

the company is dependent upon numerous service providers and other thirdparties to conduct our business while the company selects these thirdparty vendors carefully it does not control their actions any failure of these thirdparties to provide the expected or agreedupon level of service in a timely manner for any reason could adversely affect the company’s ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business further our reputation or brand could be adversely impacted by the actions of these thirdparties 

we face risks associated with vendors from whom our products are sourced 

the products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors we have agreements with our vendors in which the vendors agree to comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and to indemnify us against certain liabilities and costs our ability to recover liabilities and costs under these vendor agreements is dependent upon the financial condition and integrity of the vendors we rely on longterm relationships with our suppliers but have no significant longterm contracts with such suppliers our future success will depend in large measure upon our ability to maintain our existing supplier relationships or to develop new ones this reliance exposes us to the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various products due to political economic social health including but not limited to the recent covid19 coronavirus outbreak originating in china or environmental conditions transportation delays or changes in laws and regulations affecting distribution our vendors may be forced to reduce their production shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection which could make it difficult for us to serve the market’s needs and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

while the company selects these thirdparty vendors carefully it does not control their actions or the components or manufacturer of their products any problems caused by these thirdparties or issues associated with their products including customer or governmental complaints breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes and cyber attacks or security breaches at a vendor could subject the company to litigation and adversely affect the company’s ability to deliver products and services to its customers and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on foreign manufacturers for various products that we sell in addition many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources as an importer our business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business internationally such as domestic and foreign governmental regulations economic disruptions global or regional health epidemics delays in shipments transportation capacity and costs currency exchange rates and changes in political or economic conditions in countries from which we purchase products if any such factors were to render the conduct of business in particular countries undesirable or impractical or if additional us quotas duties tariffs taxes or other charges or restrictions were imposed upon the importation of our products in the future our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

the current political landscape in the us has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies tariffs and regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries we source a portion of our merchandise from manufacturers located outside the us primarily in asia and central america major developments in tax policy or trade relations such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise or the imposition of tariffs on imported products could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on manufacturers located in foreign countries including china for merchandise additionally a portion of our domestically purchased merchandise is manufactured abroad our business may be materially adversely affected by risks associated with international trade including the impact of tariffs imposed and potential by the us with respect to certain consumer goods imported from china 

we source a portion of our merchandise from manufacturers located outside the us primarily in asia and central america and many of our domestic vendors have a global supply chain the us has imposed tariffs on certain products imported into the us from china and could propose additional tariffs the imposition of tariffs on imported products has increased our costs and could result in reduced sales and profits in addition the imposition of tariffs by the us has resulted in the adoption of tariffs by china on us exports and could result in the adoption of tariffs by other countries as well a resulting trade war could have a significant adverse effect on world trade and the world economy further the imposition of tariffs or other changes in world trade could have an impact on certain us industries and consumers and could negatively impact the consumer demand for products that we sell 

we continue to evaluate the impact of the effective and potential tariffs on our supply chain costs sales and profitability as well as our strategies to mitigate any negative impact including negotiating with our vendors seeking alternative sourcing options and adjusting retail selling prices given the uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of the current and potential tariffs as well as the potential for additional trade actions by the us or other countries the impact on our business results of operations and financial condition is uncertain but could be significant thus we can provide no assurance that any strategies we implement to mitigate the impact of such tariffs or other trade actions will be successful in whole or in part in mitigating the impact of any current or future tariffs to the extent that our supply chain costs sales or profitability are negatively affected by the tariffs or other trade actions our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

a significant disruption to our distribution network or to the timely receipt of inventory could adversely impact sales or increase our transportation costs which would decrease our profits 

we rely on our distribution and transportation network to provide goods to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner through deliveries to our distribution facilities from vendors and then from the distribution facilities or direct ship vendors to our stores by various means of transportation including shipments by sea air rail and truck any disruption unanticipated expense or operational failure related to this process could negatively affect our operations for example unexpected delivery delays including delays due to weather fuel shortages work stoppages global or regional health epidemics or other reasons or increases in transportation costs including increased fuel costs or a decrease in transportation capacity for overseas shipments could significantly decrease our ability to provide adequate products for sale or products at a desired price resulting in lower sales and profitability in addition labor shortages or work stoppages in the transportation industry or longterm disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries could 

negatively affect our business also a fire tornado or other disaster at one of our distribution facilities could disrupt our timely receiving processing and shipment of merchandise to our stores which could adversely affect our business 

the implementation of our supply chain initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail 

we maintain a network of distribution facilities and have plans to build new distribution facilities and expand existing facilities to support our longterm strategic growth initiatives delays in opening new or expanded distribution facilities could adversely affect our future operations by slowing store growth or negatively impacting our fulfillment capabilities which may in turn reduce revenue growth in addition distributionrelated construction or expansion projects entail risks which could cause delays and cost overruns such as shortages of materials shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages unforeseen construction scheduling engineering environmental or geological problems weather interference fires or other casualty losses and unanticipated cost increases the completion date and ultimate cost of future projects could differ significantly from initial expectations due to constructionrelated or other reasons we cannot guarantee that all projects will be completed on time or within established budgets 

we continue to make significant technology investments in our supply chain these initiatives are designed to streamline our distribution process so that we can optimize the delivery of goods and services to our stores distribution facilities and customers in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives including those associated with managing thirdparty service providers and employing new webbased tools and services could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term in addition our improved supply chain technology might not provide the anticipated benefits it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the initiatives might fail altogether 

we are subject to personal injury workers’ compensation product liability discrimination harassment wrongful termination and other claims in the ordinary course of business 

our business involves a risk of personal injury workers’ compensation product liability discrimination harassment wrongful termination and other claims in the ordinary course of business product liability claims from customers and product recalls for merchandise alleged to be defective or harmful could lead to the disposal or writeoff of merchandise inventories the incurrence of fines or penalties and damage to our reputation we maintain general liability and workers’ compensation insurance with a selfinsured retention for each policy type and a deductible for each occurrence we also maintain umbrella limits above the primary general liability and product liability coverage in many cases we have indemnification rights against the manufacturers of the products and their products liability insurance as well as the property owners of our leased buildings our ability to recover costs and damages under such insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject to the financial viability of the insurers manufacturers and landlords and the specific allegations of a claim no assurance can be given that our insurance coverage or the manufacturers’ or landlords’ indemnity will be available or sufficient in any claims brought against us 

additionally we are subject to us federal state and local employment laws that expose us to potential liability if we are determined to have violated such employment laws including but not limited to laws pertaining to minimum wage rates overtime pay discrimination harassment and wrongful termination compliance with these laws including the remediation of any alleged violation may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business and results 

the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting an internal control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our business customers employees and vendors that we hold whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise could damage our reputation with customers employees and vendors could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation and could materially affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity 

we depend on information systems and technology some of which are managed or provided by thirdparties for many activities important to our business as do most retailers we receive and store in our information systems certain personal and other sensitive information about our business customers employees and vendors additionally we also receive and process information permitting cashless payments as part of our instore and online operations at tractorsupplycom  some of which depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks the information that we receive and store makes us subject to cybersecurity attacks cyber incidents and privacy regulations which are occurring more frequently are constantly evolving in nature are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives we are the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and continuously monitor our information technology networks and infrastructure in an effort to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact however these security measures cannot provide absolute assurance or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing detecting or responding to every such breach or disruption andor preventing the misuse of confidential information of our business customers employees or vendors similar risks exist with respect to the thirdparty vendors that we rely upon for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions even if the attack or breach does not directly impact our systems or information 

a compromise of our information security and privacy controls or those of businesses and vendors with whom we interact which results in confidential information being accessed obtained damaged or used by unauthorized or improper parties loss or unavailability of data disruptions to our business activities or any other outcome stemming from a cybersecurity incident could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers team members and vendors as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in significant legal and financial exposure beyond the scope or limits of insurance coverage moreover a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to respond to the attack or breach and could result in a disruption of our operations 

in addition states and the federal government are increasingly enacting laws and regulations relating to privacy data breaches and theft of employee and customer data these laws will likely increase the costs of doing business and if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these new laws we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies which could harm our business 

we are subject to paymentsrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit cards debit cards credit accounts our private label and cobranded credit cards gift cards direct debit from a customer’s bank account consumer invoicing and physical bank checks and we may offer different payment options over time these payment options subject us to many compliance requirements including but not limited to compliance with payment card association operating rules including data security rules certification requirements rules governing electronic funds transfers and payment card industry data security standards they also subject us to potential fraud by criminal elements seeking to discover and take advantage of security vulnerabilities that may exist in some of these payment systems for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks gift cards and promotional financing and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements adequately encrypt payment transaction data or if our data security systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

our business and operations could suffer material losses in the event of system interruptions or failures 

our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services managed or provided by thirdparties serve an important role in the operation and administration of our business these systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources including but not limited to human error cybersecurity attacks computer viruses unauthorized access fire flood power outages telecommunication failures facility or equipment damage natural disasters terrorism and war in addition we 

continually make investments in technology to implement new processes and systems as well as to maintain and update our existing processes and systems implementing process and system changes increases the risk of disruption if our information technology systems are interrupted or fail and our redundant systems or recovery plans are not adequate to address such interruptions or failures on a timely basis our revenues and profits could be reduced and the reputation of our brand and our business could be materially adversely affected additionally remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant unplanned expenses 

customerfacing technology systems are an important part of our sales and marketing strategy and the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences 

through our continued information technology enhancements we are able to provide an improved overall shopping environment and an omnichannel experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers tablets smart phones and other mobile communication devices we use our website tractorsupplycom  both as a sales channel for our products and as a method of providing product project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both instore and online sales omnichannel retailing is continually evolving and expanding and we must effectively respond to changing customer expectations and new developments disruptions failures or other performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our instore and online business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers 

if we are unable to maintain or upgrade our management information systems and software programs or if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient and our longterm strategic growth initiatives may not be successful 

we depend on management information systems for many aspects of our business we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that we can continue to support our business we could be materially adversely affected if we experienced a disruption or data loss relating to our management information systems and are unable to recover timely we could also be adversely impacted if we are unable to improve upgrade maintain and expand our management information systems particularly in light of the contemplated continued store growth 

the success of our longterm strategic growth initiatives designed to increase our sales and improve margin are dependent in varying degrees on the timely delivery and the functionality of information technology systems to support them extended delays or cost overruns in securing developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support the longterm strategic growth initiatives would delay and possibly even prevent us from realizing the projected benefits of those initiatives 

we cannot provide any guaranty of future dividend payments or that we will continue to repurchase our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program 

although our board of directors has indicated an intention to pay future quarterly cash dividends on our common stock any determination to pay or increase cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be based primarily upon our financial condition results of operations business requirements and our board of directors’ continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our stockholders and is in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the dividend furthermore although our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of up to  45 billion we may discontinue this program at any time or significantly reduce repurchases under the program 

the market price for our common stock might be volatile and could result in a decline in value 

the price at which our common stock trades may be volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to our operating results general trends and prospects for the retail industry announcements by our competitors analyst recommendations our ability to meet or exceed analysts’ or investors’ expectations the condition of the financial markets and other factors the company’s stock price is dependent in part on the multiple of earnings that investors are willing to pay that multiple is in part dependent on investors’ perception of the company’s future earnings growth prospects if investors’ perception of the company’s earnings growth prospects change the company’s earnings multiple may decline and its stock price could be adversely affected 

in addition the stock market has at times experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies these fluctuations as well as general economic and market conditions may adversely affect the market price of our common stock notwithstanding our actual operating performance 

our business could be negatively impacted as a result of federal state local or foreign laws and regulations 

we are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and governmental regulations including those relating to environmental protection personal injury intellectual property consumer product safety building land use and zoning requirements workplace regulations wage and hour privacy and information security and employment law matters 

our operations including our outsourced exclusive brand manufacturing partners are subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration “osha” the food and drug administration the “fda” the department of agriculture the “usda” and by various other federal state local and foreign authorities regarding the processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling and export of our products including food safety standards 

if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations or if these laws or regulations are violated by importers manufacturers or distributors we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

we are also subject to the foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” which prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business and the antibribery laws of other jurisdictions failure to comply with the fcpa and similar laws could subject us to among other things penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

potential noncompliance with environmental regulations could materially impact our results of operations or financial condition 

our business is subject to various federal state and local laws regulations and other requirements pertaining to protection of the environment and public health including for example regulations governing the management of waste materials and waste waters governmental agencies on the federal state and local levels have in recent years increasingly focused on the retail sector’s compliance with such laws and regulations and have at times pursued enforcement activities we periodically receive information requests and notices of potential noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations from governmental agencies which are addressed on a casebycase basis with the relevant agency any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

effective tax rate changes and results of examinations by taxing authorities could materially impact our results 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by legislative tax reform changes in statutory rates or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof additionally our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the earnings mix being lower than historical results in states where we have lower statutory rates and higher than historical results in states where we have higher statutory rates or by changes in the measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 

we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the internal revenue service “irs” as well as state and local taxing authorities like many retailers a portion of our sales are to taxexempt customers the business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment these circumstances create risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance our results could be materially impacted by the determinations and expenses related to these and other proceedings by the irs and other state and local taxing authorities

significant accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our financial position andor results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 









quarterly financial data 

our unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2019 and 2018 are shown below in thousands except per share amounts 





a comparable store metrics are calculated using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales excluding certain adjustments to net sales closed stores are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations stores relocated during the periods being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics if the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics becomes material we would remove relocated stores from the calculations 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in the consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales 



a our gross margin amounts may not be comparable to those of other retailers since some retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution facility network in cost of merchandise sold and others like our company exclude a portion of these distribution facility network costs from gross margin and instead include them in selling general and administrative expenses refer to note 1 – significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 

net sales increased 56 to 835 billion in fiscal 2019 from 791 billion in fiscal 2018 comparable store sales for fiscal 2019 were 813 billion a 27 increase over fiscal 2018 this compares to a 51 comparable store sales increase in the prior year the comparable store average ticket increased 24 and comparable store transaction count increased 03 for fiscal 2019 as compared to an increase of 28 and 22 in fiscal 2018 respectively 

comparable store metrics are calculated on an annual basis using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales excluding certain adjustments to net sales stores closed during the year are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations stores relocated during the years being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics if the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics becomes material we would remove relocated stores from the calculations 

all geographic regions of the company had positive comparable store sales growth the growth in comparable store sales was led by strength in everyday merchandise including consumable usable and edible “cue” products throughout the year as well as growth in seasonal merchandise categories the growth in seasonal merchandise was driven from solid demand throughout the first three fiscal quarters of the year however the fourth fiscal quarter experienced weakness in sales of coldweather seasonal and holiday discretionary products primarily as a result of unseasonably warm weather across much of the country and six fewer selling days between thanksgiving and christmas compared to last year 

in addition to comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2019 sales from stores opened less than one year were 2376 million in fiscal 2019 which represented 30 percentage points of the 56 increase over fiscal 2018 net sales sales from stores opened less than one year were 3005 million in fiscal 2018 which represented 41 percentage points of the 90 increase over fiscal 2017 net sales

total selling general and administrative “sga” expenses including depreciation and amortization increased 64 to 213 billion in fiscal 2019 from 200 billion in fiscal 2018 sga expenses as a percent of net sales increased 19 basis points to 2548 in fiscal 2019 from 2529 in fiscal 2018 sga expenses increased as a percentage of net sales due principally to incremental costs associated with a new distribution facility in frankfort new york and to a lesser extent investment in store team member wages these sga increases were partially offset by lower yearoveryear incentive compensation as a percent of net sales as well as leverage in occupancy and other costs from the increase in comparable store sales sga expenses were also negatively impacted in fiscal 2019 by approximately 29 million related to an executive transition agreement 

our effective income tax rate increased to 223 for fiscal 2019 compared to 221 in fiscal 2018 the primary cause of the increase in the companys effective income tax rate was a reduction in state investment credits 

net income in fiscal 2019 was 5624 million or 466 per diluted share compared to 5324 million or 431 per diluted share in fiscal 2018 excluding the aftertax impact of an executive transition agreement in fiscal 2019 of approximately 23 million or 002 per diluted share adjusted net income for fiscal 2019 was 5647 million or 468 per diluted share adjusted net income is a nongaap measure which has been provided in order to enhance comparability for the periods presented

comparable store metrics are calculated on an annual basis using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales excluding certain adjustments to net sales stores closed during the year are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations stores relocated during the years being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics if the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics becomes material we would remove relocated stores from the calculations acquired petsense stores are considered comparable beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 

the comparable store sales increase was broadbased across all merchandise categories and all geographic regions the growth in comparable store sales was led by strength in everyday merchandise including cue products along with strong demand for seasonal merchandise in each quarter of the year 

in addition to comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2018 sales from stores opened less than one year were 3005 million in fiscal 2018 which represented 41 percentage points of the 90 increase over fiscal 2017 net sales sales from stores opened less than one year including acquired petsense stores were 4050 million in fiscal 2017 which represented 60 percentage points of the 70 increase over fiscal 2016 net sales

gross profit increased 84 to 270 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to 249 billion in fiscal 2017 as a percent of net sales gross margin decreased 18 basis points to 3416 for fiscal 2018 compared to 3434 for fiscal 2017 the decline in gross margin resulted primarily from an increase in freight expense driven by higher carrier rates and increased diesel fuel prices as well as a negative impact from a mix shift of products sold during the fourth quarter partially offset by strength in the company’s price management program and strong sell through of seasonal merchandise throughout the year 

total sga expenses including depreciation and amortization increased 108 to 200 billion in fiscal 2018 from 181 billion in fiscal 2017 sga expenses as a percent of net sales increased 41 basis points to 2529 in fiscal 2018 from 2488 in fiscal 2017 sga expenses increased as a percentage of net sales due principally to higher incentive compensation from the strong yearoveryear growth in comparable store sales along with planned investments in infrastructure technology and team member wages at both the stores and distribution centers to support the company’s longterm strategic growth initiatives these sga increases as a percent of net sales were partially offset by leverage in occupancy and other costs from the increase in comparable store sales 

our effective income tax rate decreased to 221 for fiscal 2018 compared to 372 in fiscal 2017 the decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily related to the us tax cuts and jobs act the “tcja” that was signed into law in december 2017 which made broad and complex changes to the us tax code including but not limited to a reduction of the federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 for years beginning after december 31 2017 to a lesser extent the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2018 also incrementally benefited from state investment credits and sharebased compensation the tax legislation also increased the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2017 due to the revaluation of the company’s existing deferred tax balances at the lower federal income tax rate 

net income in fiscal 2018 was 5324 million or 431 per diluted share compared to 4226 million or 330 per diluted share in fiscal 2017 excluding the impact of the revaluation of the company’s net deferred tax asset in fiscal 2017 resulting in a onetime noncash charge of approximately 49 million or 003 per diluted share adjusted net income for fiscal 2017 was 4275 million or 333 per diluted share adjusted net income is a nongaap measure which has been provided in order to enhance comparability for the periods presented 

during fiscal 2018 we repurchased approximately 50 million shares of the company’s common stock at a total cost of 3498 million as part of our share repurchase program in fiscal 2017 we repurchased approximately 59 million shares at a total cost of 3694 million 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

in addition to normal operating expenses our primary ongoing cash requirements are for new store expansion remodeling and relocation programs distribution facility capacity and improvements information technology inventory purchases repayment of existing borrowings under our debt facilities share repurchases cash dividends and selective acquisitions as opportunities arise 

our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are existing cash balances cash provided from operations remaining funds available under our debt facilities operating and finance leases and normal trade credit our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters to support the higher sales volume of the spring and coldweather selling seasons respectively 

we believe that our existing cash balances expected cash flow from future operations funds available under our debt facilities operating and finance leases and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs including new store openings store acquisitions relocations and renovations and distribution facility capacity through the end of fiscal 2020 

working capital 

at december 28 2019 the company had working capital of 5403 million which decreased 3160 million from 2018 the shifts in working capital were attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities in millions 



in comparison to december 29 2018 working capital as of december 28 2019 was impacted most significantly by the change in operating lease liabilities due to the adoption of the new lease accounting standard under asc 842 no other changes in our working capital were significant as increases in inventory for new store growth were offset by a slight reduction in average inventory per store 

debt 

the following table summarizes the company’s outstanding debt as of the dates indicated in millions 



for additional information about the company’s debt and credit facilities refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements as further described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to hedge our exposure to variable rate interest payments associated with each of the term loans under the senior credit facility 

sources and uses of cash 

our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and funds available under our debt facilities principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures while principal uses of cash for financing activities are repurchase of the company’s common stock and cash dividends paid to stockholders 

the following table presents a summary of cash flows provided by or used in operating investing and financing activities for fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 in millions 



operating activities 

operating activities provided net cash of 8117 million 6944 million and 6315 million in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively the 1173 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was due to changes in the following in millions 



the 1173 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 is primarily driven by the fluctuation in our inventory net of accounts payable as a result of a slight decrease in our average inventory per store based on selling trends yearoveryear the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was also affected to a lesser extent by incremental profitability from company growth and the net impact of changes in our operating assets and liabilities which fluctuated due primarily to the timing of payments 

the 629 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 was due to changes in the following in millions 



the 629 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 primarily reflects incremental profitability partially offset by the increase in inventory net of accounts payable to support new store growth and the net impact of changes in our operating assets and liabilities which fluctuated due primarily to new store growth and the timing of payments

spending for distribution center capacity and improvements decreased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 and 2017 related to the completion of construction of the new northeast distribution center in frankfort new york and the expansion of our distribution center in waverly nebraska the new northeast distribution center in frankfort new york was completed and began shipping merchandise to our stores in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 the expansion of the waverly nebraska distribution center was completed during fiscal 2018 

our projected capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 principally include a plan to open approximately 80 new tractor supply stores and 10 to 15 new petsense stores continued improvements in technology and infrastructure at our existing stores and ongoing investments to enhance our digital and omnichannel capabilities to better serve our customers

the increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 principally reflects an increase in repurchases of common stock and to a lesser extent increased quarterly cash dividends partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock associated with the exercise of sharebased compensation awards 

the 1026 million increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was due to changes in the following in millions 



the increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 is largely due to a decrease in borrowings net of repayments under our debt facilities partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock associated with the exercise of sharebased compensation awards 

repurchase of common stock 

the company’s board of directors has authorized common stock repurchases under a share repurchase program of up to  45 billion exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses related to such repurchases the repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions the timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors including price corporate and regulatory requirements capital availability and other market conditions repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance the program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice 

we repurchased approximately 54 million 50 million and 59 million shares of common stock under the share repurchase program at a total cost of 5333 million 3498 million and 3694 million in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively as of december 28 2019 the company had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of  149 billion exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses

it is the present intention of the company’s board of directors to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend however the declaration and payment of future dividends will be determined by the company’s board of directors in its sole discretion and will depend upon the earnings financial condition and capital needs of the company along with any other factors which the company’s board of directors deem relevant 

significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of december 28 2019 in thousands 



a operating lease payments exclude  2128 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced 

b operating and finance lease obligations both include related interest 

c longterm debt obligations include an estimate of related interest after consideration of the interest rate swap agreements see notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our interest rates 

at december 28 2019 there were  320 million outstanding letters of credit under the 2016 senior credit facility 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements are limited to lease agreements signed but not yet commenced and outstanding letters of credit the balances for these arrangements are previously discussed letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory primarily sourced overseas in a timely manner and support certain risk management programs 

new accounting pronouncements 

the company adopted new lease accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 which had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets and related disclosures for additional information including the required disclosures related to the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance see note 1 note 6 and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued pronouncements not yet adopted as of december 28 2019 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of borrowings under our 2016 senior credit facility as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements which bear interest based on variable rates 

as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements we entered into interest rate swap agreements which are intended to mitigate interest rate risk associated with future changes in interest rates for the term loan borrowings under the 2016 senior credit facility as a result of the interest rate swaps our exposure to interest rate volatility is minimized the interest rate swap agreements have been executed for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposes 

a 1 change in interest rates on our variable rate debt in excess of that amount covered by the interest rate swaps would have affected interest expense by approximately 19 million 16 million and 21 million in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively based on the amount of outstanding variable rate debt as of december 28 2019 excluding those borrowings for which we have interest rate swaps a 1 change in interest rates would not result in any material increase in our interest expense on a prospective basis 

purchase price volatility 

although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items grain corn steel petroleum cotton and other commodities as well as duties tariffs diesel fuel and transportation services therefore we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost which may impact consumer demand and as a result sales and gross margin our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale from increased volume of purchases adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality

over the past five years we have experienced considerable sales growth resulting in a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 89  we plan to open approximately 80  new tractor supply and 10 to 15  new petsense stores in fiscal 2019  a selling square footage increase of approximately 47  in fiscal 2018  we opened 80  new tractor supply stores and 18  new petsense stores in fiscal 2017  we opened 101  new tractor supply stores and 25  new petsense stores this represents a selling square footage increase of approximately 49  during fiscal 2018  and 63  during fiscal 2017  

at december 29 2018  we operated 1940  retail stores in 49  states  1765  tractor supply and del’s retail stores and 175  petsense retail stores given the size of the communities that we target we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in many existing and new markets we have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified approximately 700  additional markets for new tractor supply stores we also believe that there is opportunity for up to 1000  petsense stores 

approximately 55  of our stores are in freestanding buildings and 45  are located in strip shopping centers we lease approximately 94  of our stores and own the remaining 6  

competition 

we operate in a competitive retail industry the principal competitive factors include location of stores fulfillment options price quality of merchandise instock inventory consistency merchandise assortment and presentation product knowledge and customer service we compete with general merchandise retailers home center retailers specialty and discount retailers independently owned retail farm and ranch stores numerous privatelyheld regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives as well as internetbased retailers however we believe we successfully differentiate ourselves from many of these retailers by focusing on our specialized market niche for customers living the rural lifestyle see further discussion of competition in 1a “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10k 

seasonality and weather 

our business is seasonal historically our sales and profits are the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products we experience our highest inventory and accounts payable balances during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal products to support the higher sales volume of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter to support the higher sales volume of the coldweather selling season we believe that our business can be more accurately assessed by focusing on the performance of the halves not the quarters due to the fact that different weather patterns from yeartoyear can shift the timing of sales and profits between quarters particularly between the first and second fiscal quarters and the third and fourth fiscal quarters 

historically weather conditions including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and unseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months have affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations in addition extreme weather conditions including snow and ice storms flood and wind damage hurricanes tornadoes extreme rain and droughts have impacted operating results both negatively and positively depending on the severity and length of these conditions our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends 

stewardship and compliance with environmental matters 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment we are committed to complying with all applicable environmental laws and regulations we are also committed to becoming a more environmentally sustainable company this commitment is demonstrated through our stewardship program which is our environmental sustainability program through this program the company has implemented a number of initiatives designed to reduce our impact on the environment these initiatives include the installation of energy management systems led lighting high efficiency heatingair conditioning systems and recycling programs in our stores distribution facilities and store support center our store support center and distribution center in casa grande arizona are leed leadership in energy and environmental design silver certified for environmentally sustainable design construction and operation we also installed solar arrays at the store support center in brentwood tennessee and our tractor supply store in hendersonville tennessee

 item 1a  risk factors 

our business faces many risks those risks of which we are currently aware and deem to be material are described below if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur our business financial condition or results of operations may significantly suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this form 10k 

general economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance 

our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending including discretionary spending a weakening of economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as lower employment levels uncertainty or changes in business or political conditions higher interest rates higher tax rates higher fuel and energy costs higher labor and healthcare costs the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to competitors a general reduction in the level of discretionary spending shifts in consumer discretionary spending to our competitors or shifts in discretionary spending to less profitable products sold by us could result in lower net sales slower inventory turnover greater markdowns on inventory and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins 

failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name 

our success depends in part on the value and strength of the tractor supply name the tractor supply name is integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business maintaining promoting and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide high quality merchandise and a consistent high quality customer experience our brand could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity failure to comply or accusation of failure to comply with ethical social product labor data privacy and environmental standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions any of these events could result in decreased revenue or otherwise adversely affect our business 

we may be unable to increase sales at our existing stores 

we experience fluctuations in our comparable store sales at our existing stores defined as sales in stores which have been open for at least twelve months various factors affect the comparable store sales at our existing stores including the general retail sales environment our ability to efficiently source and distribute products changes in our merchandise assortment competition proximity of our locations to one another or to the locations of other competing retailers increased presence of online retailers current economic conditions customer satisfaction with our products the timing of promotional events the release of new merchandise the success of marketing programs and weather conditions these factors may cause the comparable store sales results at our existing stores to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations past comparable store sales are not an indication of future results and there can be no assurance that our comparable store sales will not decrease in the future 

purchase price volatility including inflationary and deflationary pressures may adversely affect our financial performance 

although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items grain corn steel petroleum cotton and other commodities as well as diesel fuel and transportation services therefore we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost which may impact consumer demand and as a result sales and gross margin our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale from increased volume of purchases adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors while maintaining product quality should our strategy to mitigate purchase price volatility not be effective our financial performance could be adversely impacted 

weather conditions may have a significant impact on our financial results 

weather conditions affect the demand for and in some cases the supply of products which in turn has an impact on prices historically weather conditions including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and unseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months have affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations in addition extreme weather conditions including snow and ice storms flood and wind damage hurricanes tornadoes extreme rain and droughts have impacted operating results while extreme weather conditions can positively impact our operating results by 

increasing demand in affected locations for products needed to cope with the weather condition and its effects they can also negatively affect our business depending on the severity and length of these conditions as a result of store closings or the inability of customers to shop at our stores due to weather conditions our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends should such a strategy not be effective the weather may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our merchandising and marketing initiatives may not provide expected results 

we believe our past performance has been based on and future success will depend upon in part the ability to develop and execute merchandising initiatives with effective marketing programs these merchandising initiatives and marketing programs may not deliver expected results and there is no assurance that we will correctly identify and respond in a timely manner to evolving trends and consumer preferences and expectations if we misjudge the market or our marketing programs are not successful we may overstock unpopular products and be forced to take inventory price reductions that have a material adverse effect on our profitability failure to execute and promote such initiatives in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow the business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition shortages of key merchandise could also have a material adverse impact on operating results and financial condition 

capital required for growth may not be available 

the construction or acquisition of new stores store support center facilities distribution facilities or other facilities the remodeling and renovation of existing facilities and investments in information technology require significant amounts of capital in the past our growth has been funded through internally generated cash flow and bank borrowings disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the ability of the banks to meet their commitments our access to funds under our debt facilities is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time in addition tight lending practices may make it difficult for our real estate developers to obtain financing under acceptable loan terms and conditions unfavorable lending conditions could impact the timing of our store openings and materially adversely affect our ability to open new stores in desirable locations 

longerterm disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty changing or increased regulation reduced funding alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases cash dividends or other discretionary uses of cash 

failure to open and manage new stores in the number and manner currently contemplated could adversely affect our financial 

performance 

an integral part of our business strategy includes the expansion of our store base through new store openings this expansion strategy is dependent on our ability to find suitable locations and we face competition from many retailers for such sites if we are unable to implement this strategy our ability to increase our sales profitability and cash flow could be impaired significantly to the extent that we are unable to open new stores in the manner we anticipate due to among other reasons site approval or unforeseen delays in construction our sales growth may be impeded 

as we execute this expansion strategy we may also experience managerial or operational challenges which may prevent any expected increase in sales profitability or cash flow our ability to manage our planned expansion depends on the adequacy of our existing information systems the efficiency and expansion of our distribution systems the adequacy of the hiring and training process for new personnel especially store managers the effectiveness of our controls and procedures and the ability to identify customer demand and build market awareness in different geographic areas there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our planned expansion that the new stores will be effectively integrated into our existing operations or that such stores will be profitable 

although we have a rigorous real estate site selection and approval process there can be no assurance that our new store openings will be successful or result in incremental sales and profitability for the company new stores build their sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection over time and as a result generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our more mature stores as we continue to open new stores there may be a negative impact on our results from a lower contribution margin of these new stores until their sales levels ramp to chain average if at all as well as from the impact of related preopening costs 

our failure to attract and retain qualified team members increases in wage and labor costs and changes in laws and other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to continue expanding operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified team members our ability to meet labor needs while controlling wage and related labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force unemployment levels prevailing wage rates increases in legally required minimum wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs changes in employment legislation and the potential for changes in local labor practices or union activities if we are unable to locate attract or retain qualified personnel or if costs of labor or related costs increase significantly our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we are subject to federal state and local laws governing employment practices and working conditions these laws cover wage and hour practices labor relations paid and family leave workplace safety and immigration among others the laws and regulations being passed at the state and local level create unique challenges for a multistate employer we must continue to monitor and adapt our employment practices to comply with these various laws and regulations if our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly as new or revised labor laws rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented our financial performance could be adversely affected 

the unanticipated loss of current members of our senior management team and other key team members or the failure to successfully manage an executive officer transition may adversely affect our operating results 

our success depends in large part on the continued availability and service of our executive officers senior management and other key team members competition for senior management and key team members in our industry is strong and we may not be able to retain our key team members or attract new qualified team members we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other team members sufficiently both to maintain our current business and to execute our longterm strategic growth initiatives the loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management without sufficient advance notice could prevent or delay the implementation and completion of our strategic initiatives or divert management’s attention to seeking qualified replacements additionally any failure by us to manage a successful leadership transition of an executive officer and to timely identify a qualified permanent replacement could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may pursue strategic acquisitions and the failure of an acquisition to produce the anticipated results or the inability to fully integrate the acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business 

we may from time to time acquire businesses we believe to be complementary to our business the success of an acquisition is based on our ability to make accurate assumptions regarding the valuation operations growth potential integration and other factors relating to the target business acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and may result in the diversion of our capital and our management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities we may not be able to successfully integrate an organization that we acquire including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures if we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions we could experience increased costs associated with operating inefficiencies which could have an adverse effect on our financial results also while we employ several different methodologies to assess potential business opportunities the new businesses may not meet our expectations and therefore adversely affect our financial performance 

competition may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations 

we operate in the highly competitive retail merchandise sector with numerous competitors these competitors include general merchandise retailers home center retailers specialty and discount retailers independentlyowned retail farm and ranch stores numerous privatelyheld regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives as well as internetbased retailers we compete for customers merchandise real estate locations and employees this competitive environment subjects us to various other risks including the inability to continue our store and sales growth and to provide attractive merchandise to our customers at competitive prices that allow us to maintain our profitability our failure to compete effectively in this environment could adversely impact our financial performance 

we face risks associated with vendors from whom our products are sourced 

the products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors we have agreements with our vendors in which the vendors agree to comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and to indemnify us against 

certain liabilities and costs our ability to recover liabilities and costs under these vendor agreements is dependent upon the financial condition and integrity of the vendors we rely on longterm relationships with our suppliers but have no significant longterm contracts with such suppliers our future success will depend in large measure upon our ability to maintain our existing supplier relationships or to develop new ones this reliance exposes us to the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various products due to political economic social or environmental conditions transportation delays or changes in laws and regulations affecting distribution our vendors may be forced to reduce their production shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection which could make it difficult for us to serve the market’s needs and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

while the company selects these thirdparty vendors carefully it does not control their actions any problems caused by these thirdparties including those resulting from breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes and cyber attacks or security breaches at a vendor could adversely affect the company’s ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business 

we rely on foreign manufacturers for various products that we sell in addition many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources as an importer our business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business internationally such as domestic and foreign governmental regulations economic disruptions delays in shipments transportation capacity and costs currency exchange rates and changes in political or economic conditions in countries from which we purchase products if any such factors were to render the conduct of business in particular countries undesirable or impractical or if additional us quotas duties taxes or other charges or restrictions were imposed upon the importation of our products in the future our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

the current political landscape in the us has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies tariffs and regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries we source a portion of our merchandise from manufacturers located outside the us primarily in asia and central america major developments in tax policy or trade relations such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise or the imposition of tariffs on imported products could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and liquidity 

we rely on manufacturers located in foreign countries including china for merchandise additionally a portion of our domestically purchased merchandise is manufactured abroad our business may be materially adversely affected by risks associated with international trade including the impact of tariffs recently imposed and proposed by the us with respect to certain consumer goods imported from china 

we source a portion of our merchandise from manufacturers located outside the us primarily in asia and central america and many of our domestic vendors have a global supply chain the us recently imposed tariffs on certain products imported into the us from china and could propose additional tariffs the imposition of tariffs on imported products is expected to increase our costs and could result in reduced sales and profits as a result we may need to seek alternative suppliers or vendors raise retail selling prices or make changes to our operations any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability results of operations and financial condition in addition the imposition of tariffs by the us has resulted in the adoption of tariffs by china on us exports and could result in the adoption of tariffs by other countries as well a resulting trade war could have a significant adverse effect on world trade and the world economy further the imposition of tariffs or other changes in world trade could have an impact on certain us industries and consumers and could negatively impact the consumer demand for products that we sell 

we continue to evaluate the potential impact of the effective and proposed tariffs on our supply chain costs sales and profitability as well as our strategies to mitigate any negative impact including negotiating with our vendors seeking alternative sourcing options and adjusting retail selling prices given the uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of the current and proposed tariffs as well as the potential for additional trade actions by the us or other countries the impact on our business results of operations and financial condition is uncertain but could be significant thus we can provide no assurance that any strategies we implement to mitigate the impact of such tariffs or other trade actions will be successful in whole or in part in mitigating the impact of any current or future tariffs to the extent that our supply chain costs sales or profitability are negatively affected by the tariffs or other trade actions our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

a significant disruption to our distribution network or to the timely receipt of inventory could adversely impact sales or increase our transportation costs which would decrease our profits 

we rely on our distribution and transportation network to provide goods to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner through deliveries to our distribution facilities from vendors and then from the distribution facilities or direct ship vendors to our stores by various means of transportation including shipments by sea air rail and truck any disruption unanticipated expense or 

operational failure related to this process could affect store operations negatively for example unexpected delivery delays including delays due to weather fuel shortages or other reasons or increases in transportation costs including increased fuel costs or a decrease in transportation capacity for overseas shipments could significantly decrease our ability to provide adequate products for sale or products at a desired price resulting in lower sales and profitability in addition labor shortages or work stoppages in the transportation industry or longterm disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries could negatively affect our business also a fire tornado or other disaster at one of our distribution facilities could disrupt our timely receiving processing and shipment of merchandise to our stores which could adversely affect our business 

the implementation of our supply chain initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail 

we maintain a network of distribution facilities and have plans to build new distribution facilities and expand existing facilities to support our longterm strategic growth initiatives delays in opening new or expanded distribution facilities could adversely affect our future operations by slowing store growth which may in turn reduce revenue growth in addition distributionrelated construction or expansion projects entail risks which could cause delays and cost overruns such as shortages of materials shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages unforeseen construction scheduling engineering environmental or geological problems weather interference fires or other casualty losses and unanticipated cost increases the completion date and ultimate cost of future projects could differ significantly from initial expectations due to constructionrelated or other reasons we cannot guarantee that all projects will be completed on time or within established budgets 

we continue to make significant technology investments in our supply chain these initiatives are designed to streamline our distribution process so that we can optimize the delivery of goods and services to our stores distribution facilities and customers in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives including those associated with managing thirdparty service providers and employing new webbased tools and services could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term in addition our improved supply chain technology might not provide the anticipated benefits it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the initiatives might fail altogether 

we are subject to personal injury workers’ compensation product liability discrimination harassment wrongful termination and other claims in the ordinary course of business 

our business involves a risk of personal injury workers’ compensation product liability discrimination harassment wrongful termination and other claims in the ordinary course of business product liability claims from customers and product recalls for merchandise alleged to be defective or harmful could lead to the disposal or writeoff of merchandise inventories the incurrence of fines or penalties and damage to our reputation we maintain general liability and workers’ compensation insurance with a selfinsured retention for each policy type and a deductible for each occurrence we also maintain umbrella limits above the primary general liability and product liability coverage in many cases we have indemnification rights against the manufacturers of the products and their products liability insurance as well as the property owners of our leased buildings our ability to recover costs and damages under such insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject to the financial viability of the insurers manufacturers and landlords and the specific allegations of a claim no assurance can be given that our insurance coverage or the manufacturers’ or landlords’ indemnity will be available or sufficient in any claims brought against us 

additionally we are subject to us federal state and local employment laws that expose us to potential liability if we are determined to have violated such employment laws including but not limited to laws pertaining to minimum wage rates overtime pay discrimination harassment and wrongful termination compliance with these laws including the remediation of any alleged violation may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business and results 

the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting an internal control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all internal 

control systems internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our business customers employees and vendors that we hold whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise could damage our reputation with customers employees and vendors could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation and could materially affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity 

we depend on information systems and technology some of which are managed or provided by thirdparties for many activities important to our business as do most retailers we receive and store in our information systems certain personal and other sensitive information about our business customers employees and vendors additionally we also receive and process information permitting cashless payments as part of our instore and online operations at tractorsupplycom  some of which depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks the information that we receive and store makes us subject to cybersecurity attacks cyber incidents and privacy regulations which are occurring more frequently are constantly evolving in nature are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives we are the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and continuously monitor our information technology networks and infrastructure in an effort to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact however these security measures cannot provide absolute assurance or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing detecting or responding to every such breach or disruption andor preventing the misuse of confidential information of our business customers employees or vendors similar risks exist with respect to the thirdparty vendors that we rely upon for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions even if the attack or breach does not directly impact our systems or information 

a compromise of our information security and privacy controls or those of businesses and vendors with whom we interact which results in confidential information being accessed obtained damaged or used by unauthorized or improper parties loss or unavailability of data disruptions to our business activities or any other outcome stemming from a cybersecurity incident could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers team members and vendors as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in significant legal and financial exposure beyond the scope or limits of insurance coverage moreover a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to respond to the attack or breach and could result in a disruption of our operations 

in addition states and the federal government are increasingly enacting laws and regulations relating to privacy data breaches and theft of employee and customer data these laws will likely increase the costs of doing business and if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these new laws we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies which could harm our business 

we are subject to paymentsrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit cards debit cards credit accounts our private label and cobranded credit cards gift cards direct debit from a customer’s bank account consumer invoicing and physical bank checks and we may offer different payment options over time these payment options subject us to many compliance requirements including but not limited to compliance with payment card association operating rules including data security rules certification requirements rules governing electronic funds transfers and payment card industry data security standards they also subject us to potential fraud by criminal elements seeking to discover and take advantage of security vulnerabilities that may exist in some of these payment systems for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks gift cards and promotional financing and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements adequately encrypt payment transaction data or if our data security systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

our business and operations could suffer material losses in the event of system interruptions or failures 

our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services managed or provided by thirdparties serve an important role in the operation and administration of our business these systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources including but not limited to human error cybersecurity attacks computer viruses unauthorized access fire flood power outages telecommunication failures facility or equipment damage natural disasters terrorism and war in addition we continually 

make investments in technology to implement new processes and systems as well as to maintain and update our existing processes and systems implementing process and system changes increases the risk of disruption if our information technology systems are interrupted or fail and our redundant systems or recovery plans are not adequate to address such interruptions or failures on a timely basis our revenues and profits could be reduced and the reputation of our brand and our business could be materially adversely affected additionally remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant unplanned expenses 

customerfacing technology systems are an important part of our sales and marketing strategy and the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences 

through our continued information technology enhancements we are able to provide an improved overall shopping environment and an omnichannel experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers tablets smart phones and other mobile communication devices we use our website tractorsupplycom  both as a sales channel for our products and as a method of providing product project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both instore and online sales omnichannel retailing is continually evolving and expanding and we must effectively respond to changing customer expectations and new developments disruptions failures or other performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our instore and online business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers 

if we are unable to maintain or upgrade our management information systems and software programs or if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient and our longterm strategic growth initiatives may not be successful 

we depend on management information systems for many aspects of our business we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that we can continue to support our business we could be materially adversely affected if we experienced a disruption or data loss relating to our management information systems and are unable to recover timely we could also be adversely impacted if we are unable to improve upgrade maintain and expand our management information systems particularly in light of the contemplated continued store growth 

the success of our longterm strategic growth initiatives designed to increase our sales and improve margin are dependent in varying degrees on the timely delivery and the functionality of information technology systems to support them extended delays or cost overruns in securing developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support the longterm strategic growth initiatives would delay and possibly even prevent us from realizing the projected benefits of those initiatives 

we cannot provide any guaranty of future dividend payments or that we will continue to repurchase our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program 

although our board of directors has indicated an intention to pay future quarterly cash dividends on our common stock any determination to pay or increase cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be based primarily upon our financial condition results of operations business requirements and our board of directors’ continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our stockholders and is in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the dividend furthermore although our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of up to 3 billion  through december 2020  we may discontinue this program at any time or significantly reduce repurchases under the program 

the market price for our common stock might be volatile and could result in a decline in value 

the price at which our common stock trades may be volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to our operating results general trends and prospects for the retail industry announcements by our competitors analyst recommendations our ability to meet or exceed analysts’ or investors’ expectations the condition of the financial markets and other factors the company’s stock price is dependent in part on the multiple of earnings that investors are willing to pay that multiple is in part dependent on investors’ perception of the company’s future earnings growth prospects if investors’ perception of the company’s earnings growth prospects change the company’s earnings multiple may decline and its stock price could be adversely affected 

in addition the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies these fluctuations as well as general economic and market conditions may adversely affect the market price of our common stock notwithstanding our actual operating performance 

our costs of doing business could increase as a result of federal state local or foreign laws and regulations 

we are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and governmental regulations including those relating to environmental protection personal injury intellectual property consumer product safety building land use and zoning requirements workplace regulations wage and hour privacy and information security and employment law matters if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations or if these laws or regulations are violated by importers manufacturers or distributors we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

we are also subject to the foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” which prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business and the antibribery laws of other jurisdictions failure to comply with the fcpa and similar laws could subject us to among other things penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

potential noncompliance with environmental regulations could materially impact our results of operations or financial condition 

our business is subject to various federal state and local laws regulations and other requirements pertaining to protection of the environment and public health including for example regulations governing the management of waste materials and waste waters governmental agencies on the federal state and local levels have in recent years increasingly focused on the retail sector’s compliance with such laws and regulations and have at times pursued enforcement activities we periodically receive information requests and notices of potential noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations from governmental agencies which are addressed on a casebycase basis with the relevant agency any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

effective tax rate changes and results of examinations by taxing authorities could materially impact our results 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by legislative tax reform changes in statutory rates or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof additionally our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the earnings mix being lower than historical results in states where we have lower statutory rates and higher than historical results in states where we have higher statutory rates or by changes in the measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 

we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the internal revenue service “irs” as well as state and local taxing authorities like many retailers a portion of our sales are to taxexempt customers the business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment these circumstances create risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance our results could be materially impacted by the determinations and expenses related to these and other proceedings by the irs and other state and local taxing authorities

significant accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our financial position andor results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 









quarterly financial data 

our unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2018  and 2017  are shown below in thousands except per share amounts 





a comparable store metrics are calculated using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales excluding certain adjustments to net sales closed stores are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations stores relocated during the periods being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics if the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics becomes material we would remove relocated stores from the calculations petsense stores are considered comparable stores beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in the consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales 



a   our gross margin amounts may not be comparable to those of other retailers since some retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution facility network in cost of merchandise sold and others like our company exclude a portion of these distribution facility network costs from gross margin and instead include them in selling general and administrative expenses refer to note 1 – significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017   

net sales increased   90  to 791 billion  in fiscal 2018  from 726 billion  in fiscal 2017  comparable store sales for fiscal 2018  were 763 billion  a 51   increase  over fiscal 2017  this compares to a 27  comparable store sales increase  in the prior year the comparable store transaction count increased   22  and comparable store average ticket increased   28  for fiscal 2018  

comparable store metrics are calculated on an annual basis using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales excluding certain adjustments to net sales stores closed during the year are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations stores relocated during the years being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics if the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics becomes material we would remove relocated stores from the calculations acquired petsense stores are considered comparable beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 

the comparable store sales increase was broadbased across all merchandise categories and all geographic regions the growth in comparable store sales was led by strength in everyday merchandise including consumable usable and edible “cue” products along with strong demand for seasonal merchandise in each quarter of the year 

in addition to comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2018  sales from stores opened less than one year were 3005 million  in fiscal 2018  which represented 41  percentage points of the 90   increase  over fiscal 2017  net sales sales from stores opened less than one year including acquired petsense stores were 4050 million  in fiscal 2017  which represented 60  percentage points of the 70   increase  over fiscal 2016  net sales 

the following table summarizes our store growth during fiscal 2018  and 2017  



the following table indicates the percentage of net sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2018  and 2017  



gross profit increased   84  to 270 billion  in fiscal 2018  compared to 249 billion  in fiscal 2017  as a percent of net sales gross margin decreased   18  basis points to 3416  for fiscal 2018 compared to 3434  for fiscal 2017 the decline in gross margin resulted primarily from an increase in freight expense driven by higher carrier rates and increased diesel fuel prices as well as a 

negative impact from a mix shift of products sold during the fourth quarter partially offset by strength in the company’s price management program and strong sell through of seasonal merchandise throughout the year 

total selling general and administrative “sga” expenses including depreciation and amortization increased   108  to 200 billion  in fiscal 2018  from 181 billion  in fiscal 2017  sga expenses as a percent of net sales increased   41  basis points to 2529  in fiscal 2018  from 2488  in fiscal 2017  sga expenses increased as a percentage of net sales due principally to higher incentive compensation from the strong yearoveryear growth in comparable store sales along with planned investments in infrastructure technology and team member wages at both the stores and distribution centers to support the company’s longterm strategic growth initiatives these sga increases as a percent of net sales were partially offset by leverage in occupancy and other costs from the increase in comparable store sales 

our effective income tax rate decreased  to 221  for fiscal 2018  compared to 372  in fiscal 2017  the decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily related to the us tax cuts and jobs act the “tcja” that was signed into law in december 2017 which made broad and complex changes to the us tax code including but not limited to a reduction of the federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 for years beginning after december 31 2017 to a lesser extent the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2018 also incrementally benefited from state investment credits and sharebased compensation the tax legislation also increased the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2017 due to the revaluation of the company’s existing deferred tax balances at the lower federal income tax rate 

net income in fiscal 2018  was 5324 million  or 431  per diluted share compared to 4226 million  or 330  per diluted share in fiscal 2017  excluding the impact of the revaluation of the company’s net deferred tax asset in fiscal 2017 resulting in a onetime noncash charge of approximately 49 million or 003 per diluted share adjusted net income for fiscal 2017 was 4275 million or 333 per diluted share adjusted net income is a nongaap measure which has been provided in order to enhance comparability for the periods presented 

during fiscal 2018  we repurchased approximately 50 million  shares of the company’s common stock at a total cost of 3498 million  as part of our 3 billion  share repurchase program in fiscal 2017  we repurchased approximately 59 million  shares at a total cost of 3694 million  

fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016   

net sales increased 70 to 726 billion in fiscal 2017 from 678 billion in fiscal 2016 the prior year included an extra sales week as a part of the company’s 53week calendar in 2016 which negatively impacted the overall sales increase by approximately 16 percentage points comparable store sales for fiscal 2017 were 685 billion a 27 increase over fiscal 2016 this compares to a 16 comparable store sales increase in the prior year the comparable store transaction count increased 22 and comparable store average ticket increased 05 for fiscal 2017 

comparable store metrics are calculated on an annual basis using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales excluding certain adjustments to net sales stores closed during the year are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations stores relocated during the years being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics if the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics becomes material we would remove relocated stores from the calculations acquired petsense stores are considered comparable beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 

the comparable store sales increase was driven by an increase in traffic counts and the yearround strength of cue products primarily animal and petrelated merchandise warmer than normal weather patterns early in the first quarter negatively impacted the sales of winter seasonal items and winter storms in march had an unfavorable impact on the start to the spring selling season beginning in the second quarter we experienced broadbased improvement through the remainder of the year in all geographic regions and major product categories driven by strength in sales of everyday basic items in cue and yearround products the third quarter experienced an additional benefit from an extended spring and summer selling season and strong sales of emergency response products related to hurricanes during the quarter while the fourth quarter experienced an additional benefit from solid sales in cold weather and other seasonal products 

in addition to comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2017 sales from stores opened less than one year including petsense were 4050 million in fiscal 2017 which represented 60 percentage points of the 70 increase over fiscal 2016 net sales sales from stores opened less than one year including acquired petsense stores were 3789 million in fiscal 2016 which represented 61 percentage points of the 89 increase over fiscal 2015 net sales 

the following table summarizes our store growth during fiscal 2017  and 2016  



the following table indicates the percentage of net sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2017  and 2016  



gross profit increased 72 to 249 billion in fiscal 2017 compared to 233 billion in fiscal 2016 as a percent of net sales gross margin remained flat to prior year at 343 gross margin percentage was negatively impacted by higher markdowns on cold weather merchandise and targeted promotional activity in the first quarter as well as a higher freight expense throughout the year due to higher carrier costs increased average fuel costs and a shift in product mix towards more freight intensive products these declines in gross margin were offset by strong sellthrough rates and solid price and inventory management particularly in the back half of the year 

sga expenses including depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2017 increased 107 to 181 billion from 163 billion in fiscal 2016 sga expenses as a percent of net sales increased 80 basis points to 249 in fiscal 2017 from 241 in fiscal 2016 the increase in sga as a percent of net sales was primarily attributable to higher store payroll from wage inflation and our continued effort to enhance customer service increased incentive compensation at the store level from the strong yearoveryear growth in comparable store sales the deleverage of occupancy and other fixed costs resulting from the integration of petsense expenses and the 53 rd week of sales in fiscal 2016 that did not reoccur in fiscal 2017 and investments in infrastructure and technology to support our strategic longterm growth initiatives 

our effective tax rate increased to 372 for fiscal 2017 compared to 365 in fiscal 2016 as a result of the tcja we made a reasonable estimate of the effects of the tax legislation on our existing deferred tax balances as of december 30 2017 and recognized a onetime noncash charge of 49 million which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations in fiscal 2017 excluding the impacts of the tcja our effective income tax rate in fiscal 2017 would have been 364 

for fiscal 2017 net income was 4226 million or 330 per diluted share compared to 4371 million or 327 per diluted share in fiscal 2016 excluding the impact of the revaluation of the company’s net deferred tax asset in fiscal 2017 resulting in a onetime noncash charge of approximately 49 million or 003 per diluted share adjusted net income for fiscal 2017 was 4275 

million or 333 per diluted share adjusted net income is a nongaap measure which has been provided in order to enhance comparability for the periods presented 

during fiscal 2017 we repurchased approximately 59 million shares of the company’s common stock at a total cost of 3694 million as part of our 3 billion share repurchase program in fiscal 2016 we repurchased approximately 44 million shares at a total cost of 3317 million 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

in addition to normal operating expenses our primary ongoing cash requirements are for new store expansion remodeling and relocation programs distribution facility capacity and improvements information technology inventory purchases repayment of 

existing borrowings under our debt facilities share repurchases cash dividends and selective acquisitions as opportunities arise 

our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are existing cash balances cash provided from operations remaining funds available under our debt facilities capital and operating leases and normal trade credit our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters to support the higher sales volume of the spring and coldweather selling seasons respectively 

we believe that our existing cash balances expected cash flow from future operations funds available under our debt facilities operating and capital leases and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs including new store openings store acquisitions relocations and renovations and distribution facility capacity through the end of fiscal 2019  

working capital 

at december 29 2018  the company had working capital of 8563 million  which increased   501 million  from december 30 2017  the shifts in working capital were attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities in millions 



in comparison to december 30 2017  working capital as of december 29 2018  was impacted most significantly by changes in our inventory accounts payable and other accrued expenses 



as discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements the company will adopt new guidance related to lease accounting in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 which will result in the company recognizing a rightofuse asset and a corresponding lease liability on its balance sheet the company expects the adoption of this new guidance to have a negative impact to working capital of approximately 250 million to 300 million due to the recognition of a current portion of operating lease obligations the guidance will be adopted on a prospective basis in fiscal 2019 so prior periods will no longer be comparable 

debt 

the following table summarizes the company’s outstanding debt as of the dates indicated in millions 



for additional information about the company’s debt and credit facilities refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements as further described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to hedge our exposure to variable rate interest payments associated with each of the term loans under the senior credit facility 

sources and uses of cash 

our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and funds available under our debt facilities principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures and selective acquisitions while principal uses of cash for financing activities are repurchase of the company’s common stock and cash dividends paid to stockholders 

the following table presents a summary of cash flows provided by or used in operating investing and financing activities for fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 in millions 



a as a result of the adoption of asu 201609 excess tax benefits on stock options exercised are no longer presented as a separate line item in the consolidated statements of cash flows the presentation of fiscal 2016 has been adjusted to conform to the current presentation 

operating activities 

operating activities provided net cash of 6944 million  6315 million  and 6507 million  in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the 629 million   increase  in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  was due to changes in the following in millions 



the 629 million   increase  in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  primarily reflects incremental profitability partially offset by the increase in inventory net of accounts payable to support new store growth and the net impact of changes in our operating assets and liabilities which fluctuated due primarily to new store growth and the timing of payments 

the 192 million   decrease  in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  was due to changes in the following in millions 



a as a result of the adoption of asu 201609 excess tax benefits on stock options exercised are no longer presented as a separate line item in the consolidated statements of cash flows the presentation of fiscal 2016 has been adjusted to conform to the current presentation 

the 192 million   decrease  in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017  compared with fiscal 2016  primarily reflects the timing of receipts and payments in relation to inventory and accounts payable partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization due to new store growth and investments in information technology and infrastructure 

investing activities 

investing activities used cash of 2763 million  2380 million  and 3693 million  in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively fiscal 2016 had a significant cash outflow from investing activities related to the acquisition of petsense other than cash flows related to the acquisition of petsense cash flows from investing activities in the years presented are primarily composed of capital expenditures capital expenditures for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  were as follows in millions 



the sustained increase in spending on information technology represents continued support of our store growth and our omnichannel platform as well as improvements in security and compliance enhancements to our customer relationship management program and other longterm strategic growth initiatives 

spending for distribution center capacity and improvements increased in fiscal 2018 and 2017 related to the construction of the new northeast distribution center in frankfort new york and the expansion of our distribution center in waverly nebraska the new northeast distribution center in frankfort new york is nearing completion as it began receiving merchandise in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018 and is expected to begin shipping merchandise to our stores in the first fiscal quarter of 2019 the expansion of the waverly nebraska distribution center was completed during fiscal 2018 

the above table reflects an investment in 80  new tractor supply stores 18  new petsense stores and four  store relocations during fiscal 2018  in fiscal 2017  we opened 101  new tractor supply stores 25  new petsense stores and had three  store relocations in fiscal 2016  we opened 113  new tractor supply stores began operating 143  petsense stores including 8 new stores after acquisition and had three  store relocations 

spending on existing stores principally reflects routine refresh activity spending in fiscal 2016 was higher than spending in fiscal 2018 and 2017 due to the investment in the chainwide led lighting retrofit which began in fiscal 2016 and was completed in fiscal 2017 

our projected capital expenditures for fiscal 2019 principally include a plan to open approximately 80  new tractor supply stores and 10 to 15  new petsense stores continued improvements in technology and infrastructure at our existing stores and ongoing investments to enhance our digital and omnichannel capabilities to better serve our customers 

financing activities 

financing activities used cash of 4409 million  3383 million  and 2913 million  in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

the 1026 million   increase  in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  was due to changes in the following in millions 



the increase  in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  is largely due to a decrease in borrowings net of repayments under our debt facilities partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock associated with the exercise of sharebased compensation awards 

the 470 million   increase  in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  was due to changes in the following in millions 



a as a result of the adoption of asu 201609 excess tax benefits on stock options exercised are no longer presented as a separate line item in the consolidated statement of cash flows the presentation of fiscal 2016 has been adjusted to conform to the current presentation 

the increase  in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  is due to incremental share repurchases of common stock and a reduction in proceeds from the issuance of common stock partially offset by an increase in borrowings net of repayments under our debt facilities 

repurchase of common stock 

the company’s board of directors has authorized common stock repurchases under a share repurchase program of up to 3 billion  exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses related to such repurchases through december 31 2020  the repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions the timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors including price corporate and regulatory requirements capital availability and other market conditions repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance the program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice 

we repurchased approximately 50 million  59 million  and 44 million  shares of common stock under the share repurchase program at a total cost of 3498 million  3694 million  and 3317 million  in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively as of december 29 2018  the company had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of 5200 million  exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses 

cash dividends paid to stockholders 

we paid cash dividends totaling 1471 million  1338 million  and 1223 million  in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively in fiscal 2018  we declared and paid cash dividends to stockholders of 120  per common share outstanding as compared to 105  and 092  per common share outstanding in fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016  respectively these payments reflect an increase in the quarterly dividend in the second quarter of fiscal 2018  to 031  per share from 027  per share and an increase in the quarterly dividend in the second quarter of fiscal 2017  to 027  per share from 024  per share 

it is the present intention of the company’s board of directors to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend however the declaration and payment of future dividends will be determined by the company’s board of directors in its sole discretion and will depend upon the earnings financial condition and capital needs of the company as well as other factors which the company’s board of directors deem relevant 

significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of december 29 2018  in thousands 



a capital lease obligations include related interest 

b longterm debt obligations include an estimate of related interest after consideration of the interest rate swap agreements see notes 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our interest rates 

at december 29 2018  there were 335 million  outstanding letters of credit under the 2016 senior credit facility 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements are limited to operating leases and outstanding letters of credit the balances for these arrangements are previously discussed we typically lease buildings for retail stores rather than acquiring these assets through purchases letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory primarily sourced overseas in a timely manner and support certain risk management programs 

new accounting pronouncements 

the   company adopted new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 

refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued pronouncements not yet adopted as of december 29 2018  




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of borrowings under our 2016 senior credit facility as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements which bear interest based on variable rates 

as discussed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements we entered into interest rate swap agreements which are intended to mitigate interest rate risk associated with future changes in interest rates for the term loan borrowings under the 2016 senior credit facility as a result of the interest rate swaps our exposure to interest rate volatility is minimized the interest rate swap agreements have been executed for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposes 

a 1 change in interest rates on our variable rate debt in excess of that amount covered by the interest rate swaps would have affected interest expense by approximately 16 million  21 million  and 15 million  in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively as of december 29 2018  we have no outstanding variable rate debt other than the borrowings which are covered by interest rate swaps therefore on a prospective basis a 1 change in interest rates on our variable rate debt in excess of that amount covered by the interest rate swaps would result in no additional interest expense 

purchase price volatility 

although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items grain corn steel petroleum cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services therefore we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost which may impact consumer demand and as a result sales and gross margin our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale from increased volume of purchases adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality

business strategy 

we believe our sales and earnings growth is the result of executing our business strategy which includes the following key components 

  

market niche 

we have identified a specialized market niche supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and others who enjoy the rural lifestyle as well as tradesmen and small businesses by focusing our product assortment on these core customers we believe we are differentiated from general merchandise home center and other specialty retailers we cater to the rural lifestyle and often serve a market by being a trip consolidator for many basic maintenance needs for farm ranch and rural customers 

customers 

our target customers are home land pet and livestock owners who generally have above average income and below average cost of living we seek to serve a customer base that primarily lives in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities this customer base includes recreational farmers and ranchers and others who enjoy the rural lifestyle as well as tradesmen and small businesses

we use a thirdparty provider to measure our level of customer service this process allows customers to provide feedback on their shopping experience based on the thirdparty provider’s data we believe our customer satisfaction scores to be among the bestinclass we carefully evaluate the feedback we receive from our customers and implement improvements at the individual store level based on that feedback 

store personnel and training 

we seek to hire store team members with farming and ranching backgrounds with particular emphasis on general maintenance equine and welding we endeavor to staff our stores with courteous highly motivated team members and devote considerable resources to training store team members often in cooperation with our vendors our training programs include 

 

store environment 

our stores are designed and managed to make shopping an enjoyable experience and to maximize sales and operating efficiencies stores are strategically arranged to provide an open environment for optimal product placement and visual display in addition these layouts allow for departmental space to be easily reallocated and visual displays to be changed for seasonal products and promotions display and product placement information is routinely sent to stores to ensure quality and uniformity among the stores informative signs are located in key product categories to assist customers with purchasing decisions and merchandise location these signs provide customers with a comparison of product qualities clear pricing useful information regarding product benefits and suggestions for appropriate accessories our store layouts and visual displays are designed to provide our customers a feeling of familiarity and enhance the shopping experience also our store team members wear highly visible red vests aprons or smocks with nametags and our customer service and checkout counters are conveniently located near the front of the store 

merchandising and purchasing

the following table indicates the percentage of net sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  



our buying team continuously reviews and updates our product assortment to respond to customer needs and to offer new relevant products we are focused on providing key products that our customers use on a regular basis for their lifestyle and maintenance 

needs with emphasis on consumable usable and edible “cue” products examples of cue product categories include but are not limited to livestock feed and bedding pet food lubricants and various seasonal products such as heating pest control and twine 

our products are sourced through both domestic and international vendors our business is not dependent upon any one vendor or particular group of vendors we purchase our products from a group of approximately 900  vendors with no one vendor representing more than 10  of our purchases during fiscal 2017  approximately 350  core vendors accounted for 90  of our merchandise purchases during fiscal 2017  we have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative sources of supply for our products and we believe that adequate sources of supply exist at substantially similar costs for nearly all of our products we have no material longterm contractual commitments with any of our product vendors 

our buying teams focus on merchandise procurement vendor line reviews and testing of new products and programs we also employ a dedicated inventory management team that focuses exclusively on forecasting and inventory replenishment a committed merchandise planning team that concentrates on assortment planning and a specialized pricing team that seeks to optimize marketspecific pricing for our products through the combined efforts of these teams we continue to focus on improving our overall inventory productivity and instock position 

intellectual property 

our subsidiary tractor supply co of texas lp “tsct” owns registrations with the us patent and trademark office “uspto” for various service marks including tsc ®  tractor supply co ®  tsc tractor supply co ®  and the trapezium design for retail store services we consider these service marks and the accompanying goodwill and name recognition to be valuable assets of our business tsct also owns several other service marks for retail services some of which have been registered with the uspto and some of which are the subject of applications for registration pending before the uspto 

in addition to selling products that bear nationallyknown manufacturer brands we also sell products manufactured for us under a number of exclusive brands that we consider to be important to our business these exclusive brands are manufactured for us by a number of vendors and provide an alternative to the national brands which helps provide value for our customers and positions us as a destination store

our trademark and service mark registrations have various expiration dates however provided that we continue to use the marks and renew the registrations in a timely manner the registrations are potentially perpetual in duration 

we believe our intellectual property which includes the trademarks and service marks identified above together with certain trade names domain names patents and copyrights has significant value and is an important component of our merchandising and marketing strategies 

distribution 

we currently operate a distribution network for supplying stores with merchandise and delivering product ordered through tractorsupplycom  in fiscal 2017  our tractor supply stores received approximately 74  of merchandise through this network while the remaining merchandise shipped directly to the stores from our vendors or directly to our customers we believe this flow facilitates the prompt and efficient distribution of merchandise in order to enhance instocks minimize freight costs and improve the inventory turn rate our distribution facilities located in arizona georgia indiana kentucky maryland nebraska texas and washington represent total distribution capacity of 50 million  square feet in fiscal 2017 we began construction on a new northeast distribution center in frankfort new york as well as an expansion of our existing distribution center in waverly nebraska which will provide additional distribution capacity once construction is completed

growth strategy 

tractor supply believes we can grow our business by being the most dependable supplier of relevant products and services for the “ out here ” lifestyle creating customer loyalty through personalized experiences and providing convenience that our customers expect at anytime anywhere and in any way they choose our longterm growth strategy is to 1 drive profitable growth through new store openings and by expanding omnichannel capabilities thus tying together our website product content social media digital and online shopping experience attracting new customers and driving loyalty 2 build customercentric engagement by leveraging analytics to deliver legendary customer service seasoned advice and personalized experiences 3 offer relevant assortments and services across all channels through exclusive and national brands and continue to introduce new products through our test and learn strategy 4 enhance our core and foundational capabilities by investing in infrastructure and process improvements which will support growth scale and agility while improving the customer experience and 5 expand through selective acquisitions as such opportunities arise to add complementary businesses and to enhance penetration into new and existing markets to supplement organic growth   

achieving this strategy will require a foundational focus on 1 organizing optimizing and empowering our team members for growth by developing skills talent and leadership across the organization and 2 implementing operational efficiency initiatives to align our cost structure to support new business capabilities for margin improvement and cost reductions   

over the past five years we have experienced considerable sales growth resulting in a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 92  we plan to open approximately 80  new tractor supply and 20  new petsense stores in fiscal 2018  a selling square footage increase of approximately 50  in fiscal 2017  we opened 101  new tractor supply stores and 25  new petsense 

stores in fiscal 2016 we opened 113  new tractor supply stores and began operating 143 petsense stores this represents a selling square footage increase of approximately 63  during fiscal 2017  and 108  during fiscal 2016  

at december 30 2017  we operated 1853  retail stores in 49  states  1685  tractor supply and del’s retail stores and 168  petsense retail stores given the size of the communities that we target we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in many existing and new markets we have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified approximately 800  additional markets for new tractor supply stores we also believe that there is opportunity for up to 1000 petsense stores approximately 40  of our tractor supply stores are in freestanding buildings and 60  are located in strip shopping centers we lease approximately 93  of our stores and own the remaining 7  

competition 

we operate in a competitive retail industry the principal competitive factors include location of stores fulfillment options price quality of merchandise instock consistency merchandise assortment and presentation product knowledge and customer service we compete with general merchandise retailers home center retailers specialty and discount retailers independently owned retail farm and ranch stores numerous privatelyheld regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives as well as internetbased retailers however we believe we successfully differentiate ourselves from many of these retailers by focusing on our specialized market niche for customers living the rural lifestyle see further discussion of competition in 1a “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10k 

seasonality and weather 

our business is seasonal historically our sales and profits are the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products we experience our highest inventory and accounts payable balances during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal products to support the higher sales volume of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter to support the higher sales volume of the coldweather selling season we believe that our business can be more accurately assessed by focusing on the performance of the halves not the quarters due to the fact that different weather patterns from yeartoyear can shift the timing of sales and profits between quarters particularly between the first and second fiscal quarters and the third and fourth fiscal quarters 

historically weather conditions including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and unseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months have affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations in addition extreme weather conditions including snow and ice storms flood and wind damage hurricanes tornadoes extreme rain and droughts have impacted operating results both negatively and positively depending on the severity and length of these conditions our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends 

stewardship and compliance with environmental matters 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment we are committed to complying with all applicable environmental laws and regulations we are also committed to becoming a more environmentally sustainable company this commitment is demonstrated through our stewardship program which is our environmental sustainability program through this program the company has implemented a number of initiatives designed to reduce our impact on the environment these initiatives include the installation of energy management systems led lighting high efficiency heatingair conditioning systems in our stores and recycling programs in our stores distribution facilities and the store support center our store support center opened in 2014 and our distribution center in casa grande arizona opened in 2015 were each awarded leed leadership in energy and environmental design silver certification for environmentally sustainable design construction and operation we also installed solar arrays at the store support center in brentwood tennessee and our store in hendersonville tennessee

 item 1a  risk factors 

our business faces many risks those risks of which we are currently aware and deem to be material are described below if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur our business financial condition or results of operations may significantly suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this form 10k 

general economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance 

our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending including discretionary spending a weakening of economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as lower employment levels uncertainty or changes in business or political conditions higher interest rates higher tax rates higher fuel and energy costs higher labor and healthcare costs the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to competitors a general reduction in the level of discretionary spending shifts in consumer discretionary spending to our competitors or shifts in discretionary spending to less profitable products sold by us could result in lower net sales slower inventory turnover greater markdowns on inventory and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins 

failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name 

our success depends in part on the value and strength of the tractor supply name the tractor supply name is integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business maintaining promoting and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide high quality merchandise and a consistent high quality customer experience our brand could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity failure to comply or accusation of failure to comply with ethical social product labor data privacy and environmental standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions any of these events could result in decreased revenue or otherwise adversely affect our business 

we may be unable to increase sales at our existing stores 

we experience fluctuations in our comparable store sales defined as sales in stores which have been open for at least twelve months various factors affect comparable store sales including the general retail sales environment our ability to efficiently source and distribute products changes in our merchandise assortment competition proximity of our locations to one another or to the locations of other retailers increased presence of online retailers current economic conditions customer satisfaction with our products the timing of promotional events the release of new merchandise the success of marketing programs and weather conditions these factors may cause our comparable store sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations past comparable store sales are not an indication of future results and there can be no assurance that our comparable store sales will not decrease in the future 

purchase price volatility including inflationary and deflationary pressures may adversely affect our financial performance 

although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items grain corn steel petroleum cotton and other commodities as well as diesel fuel and transportation services therefore we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost which may impact consumer demand and as a result sales and gross margin our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale from increased volume of purchases adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors while maintaining product quality should our strategy to mitigate purchase price volatility not be effective our financial performance could be adversely impacted 

weather conditions may have a significant impact on our financial results 

weather conditions affect the demand for and in some cases the supply of products which in turn has an impact on prices historically weather conditions including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and unseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months have affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations in addition extreme weather conditions including snow and ice storms flood and wind damage hurricanes tornadoes extreme rain and 

droughts have impacted operating results while extreme weather conditions can positively impact our operating results by increasing demand in affected locations for products needed to cope with the weather condition and its effects they can also negatively affect our business depending on the severity and length of these conditions as a result of store closings or the inability of customers to shop at our stores due to weather conditions our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends should such a strategy not be effective the weather may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our merchandising and marketing initiatives may not provide expected results 

we believe our past performance has been based on and future success will depend upon in part the ability to develop and execute merchandising initiatives with effective marketing programs these merchandising initiatives and marketing programs may not deliver expected results and there is no assurance that we will correctly identify and respond in a timely manner to evolving trends and consumer preferences and expectations if we misjudge the market or our marketing programs are not successful we may overstock unpopular products and be forced to take inventory price reductions that have a material adverse effect on our profitability failure to execute and promote such initiatives in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow the business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition shortages of key merchandise could also have a material adverse impact on operating results and financial condition 

capital required for growth may not be available 

the construction or acquisition of new stores store support center facilities distribution facilities or other facilities the remodeling and renovation of existing facilities and investments in information technology require significant amounts of capital in the past our growth has been funded through internally generated cash flow and bank borrowings disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the ability of the banks to meet their commitments our access to funds under our debt facilities is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time in addition tight lending practices may make it difficult for our real estate developers to obtain financing under acceptable loan terms and conditions unfavorable lending practices could impact the timing of our store openings and materially adversely affect our ability to open new stores in desirable locations 

longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty changing or increased regulation reduced funding alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases cash dividends or other discretionary uses of cash 

failure to open and manage new stores in the number and manner currently contemplated could adversely affect our financial performance 

an integral part of our business strategy includes the expansion of our store base through new store openings this expansion strategy is dependent on our ability to find suitable locations and we face competition from many retailers for such sites if we are unable to implement this strategy our ability to increase our sales profitability and cash flow could be impaired significantly to the extent that we are unable to open new stores in the manner we anticipate due to among other reasons site approval or unforeseen delays in construction our sales growth may be impeded 

as we execute this expansion strategy we may also experience managerial or operational challenges which may prevent any expected increase in sales profitability or cash flow our ability to manage our planned expansion depends on the adequacy of our existing information systems the efficiency and expansion of our distribution systems the adequacy of the hiring and training process for new personnel especially store managers the effectiveness of our controls and procedures and the ability to identify customer demand and build market awareness in different geographic areas there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our planned expansion that the new stores will be effectively integrated into our existing operations or that such stores will be profitable 

although we have a rigorous real estate site selection and approval process there can be no assurance that our new store openings will be successful or result in incremental sales and profitability for the company new stores build their sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection over time and as a result generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our more mature stores as we continue to open new stores there may be a negative impact on our results from a lower contribution margin of these new stores until their sales levels ramp to chain average if at all as well as from the impact of related preopening costs 

our failure to attract and retain qualified team members increases in wage and labor costs and changes in laws and other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to continue expanding operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified team members our ability to meet labor needs while controlling wage and related labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force unemployment levels prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs changes in employment legislation and the potential for changes in local labor practices or union activities if we are unable to locate attract or retain qualified personnel or if costs of labor or related costs increase significantly our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we are subject to federal state and local laws governing employment practices and working conditions these laws cover wage and hour practices labor relations paid and family leave workplace safety and immigration among others the laws and regulations being passed at the state and local level create unique challenges for a multistate employer we must continue to monitor and adapt our employment practices to comply with these various laws and regulations if our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly as new or revised labor laws rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we may pursue strategic acquisitions and the failure of an acquisition to produce the anticipated results or the inability to fully integrate the acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business 

we may from time to time acquire businesses we believe to be complementary to our business the success of an acquisition is based on our ability to make accurate assumptions regarding the valuation operations growth potential integration and other factors relating to the target business acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and may result in the diversion of our capital and our management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities we may not be able to successfully integrate an organization that we acquire including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures if we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions we could experience increased costs associated with operating inefficiencies which could have an adverse effect on our financial results also while we employ several different methodologies to assess potential business opportunities the new businesses may not meet our expectations and therefore adversely affect our financial performance 

competition may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations 

we operate in the highly competitive retail merchandise sector with numerous competitors these competitors include general merchandise retailers home center retailers specialty and discount retailers independently owned retail farm and ranch stores numerous privatelyheld regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives as well as internetbased retailers we compete for customers merchandise real estate locations and employees this competitive environment subjects us to various other risks including the inability to continue our store and sales growth and to provide attractive merchandise to our customers at competitive prices that allow us to maintain our profitability our failure to compete effectively in this environment could adversely impact our financial performance 

we face risks associated with vendors from whom our products are sourced 

the products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors we have agreements with our vendors in which the vendors agree to comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and to indemnify us against certain liabilities and costs our ability to recover liabilities and costs under these vendor agreements is dependent upon the financial condition and integrity of the vendors we rely on longterm relationships with our suppliers but have no longterm contracts with such suppliers our future success will depend in large measure upon our ability to maintain our existing supplier relationships or to develop new ones this reliance exposes us to the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various products due to political economic social or environmental conditions transportation delays or changes in laws and regulations affecting distribution our vendors may be forced to reduce their production shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection which could make it difficult for us to serve the market’s needs and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

while the company selects these thirdparty vendors carefully it does not control their actions any problems caused by these third parties including those resulting from breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes and cyber attacks or security breaches at a vendor could adversely affect the company’s ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business 

we rely on foreign manufacturers for various products that we sell in addition many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources as an importer our business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business internationally such as domestic and foreign governmental regulations economic disruptions delays in shipments transportation capacity and costs currency exchange rates and changes in political or economic conditions in countries from which we purchase products if any such factors were to render the conduct of business in particular countries undesirable or impractical or if additional 

us quotas duties taxes or other charges or restrictions were imposed upon the importation of our products in the future our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

the current political landscape in the us has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies tariffs and regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries we source a portion of our merchandise from manufacturers located outside the us primarily in asia and central america major developments in tax policy or trade relations such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise or the imposition of tariffs on imported products could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and liquidity 

a significant disruption to our distribution network or to the timely receipt of inventory could adversely impact sales or increase our transportation costs which would decrease our profits 

we rely on our distribution and transportation network to provide goods to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner through deliveries to our distribution facilities from vendors and then from the distribution facilities or direct ship vendors to our stores by various means of transportation including shipments by sea air rail and truck any disruption unanticipated expense or operational failure related to this process could affect store operations negatively for example unexpected delivery delays including delays due to weather fuel shortages or other reasons or increases in transportation costs including increased fuel costs or a decrease in transportation capacity for overseas shipments could significantly decrease our ability to provide adequate product for sale or products at a desired price resulting in lower sales and profitability in addition labor shortages or work stoppages in the transportation industry or longterm disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries could negatively affect our business also a fire tornado or other disaster at one of our distribution facilities could disrupt our timely receiving processing and shipment of merchandise to our stores which could adversely affect our business 

the implementation of our supply chain initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail 

we maintain a network of distribution facilities and have plans to build new facilities and expand existing facilities to support our growth objectives delays in opening new or expanded distribution facilities could adversely affect our future operations by slowing store growth which may in turn reduce revenue growth in addition distributionrelated construction or expansion projects entail risks which could cause delays and cost overruns such as shortages of materials shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages unforeseen construction scheduling engineering environmental or geological problems weather interference fires or other casualty losses and unanticipated cost increases the completion date and ultimate cost of future projects could differ significantly from initial expectations due to constructionrelated or other reasons we cannot guarantee that all projects will be completed on time or within established budgets 

we continue to make significant technology investments in our supply chain these initiatives are designed to streamline our distribution process so that we can optimize the delivery of goods and services to our stores and distribution facilities in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives including those associated with managing thirdparty service providers and employing new webbased tools and services could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term in addition our improved supply chain technology might not provide the anticipated benefits it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the initiatives might fail altogether 

we are subject to personal injury workers’ compensation product liability discrimination harassment wrongful termination and other claims in the ordinary course of business 

our business involves a risk of personal injury workers’ compensation product liability discrimination harassment wrongful termination and other claims in the ordinary course of business product liability claims from customers and product recalls for merchandise alleged to be defective or harmful could lead to the disposal or writeoff of merchandise inventories the incurrence of fines or penalties and damage to our reputation we maintain general liability and workers’ compensation insurance with a selfinsured retention for each policy type and a deductible for each occurrence we also maintain umbrella limits above the primary general liability and product liability coverage in many cases we have indemnification rights against the manufacturers of the products and their products liability insurance as well as the property owners of our leased buildings our ability to recover costs and damages under such insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject to the financial viability of the insurers manufacturers and landlords and the specific allegations of a claim no assurance can be given that our insurance coverage or the manufacturers’ or landlords’ indemnity will be available or sufficient in any claims brought against us 

additionally we are subject to us federal state and local employment laws that expose us to potential liability if we are determined to have violated such employment laws including but not limited to laws pertaining to minimum wage rates overtime pay 

discrimination harassment and wrongful termination compliance with these laws including the remediation of any alleged violation may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business and results 

the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting an internal control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all internal 

control systems internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our business customers employees and vendors that we hold whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise could damage our reputation with customers employees and vendors could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation and could adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity 

we receive certain personal and other confidential information about our customers employees and vendors we also rely on business partners to provide services to us that may include important business information or data about our customers employees and vendors in addition our online operations at tractorsupplycom  and petsensecom   depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments while we maintain substantial security measures to help protect and prevent unauthorized access to such information it is possible that unauthorized parties through cybersecurity attacks which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated or by other means might compromise our security measures and obtain and misuse the personal information of customers employees and vendors that we hold or other confidential company data it is possible that such a compromise could go undetected by us such an occurrence could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers employees and vendors as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in significant legal and financial exposure beyond the scope or limits of insurance coverage moreover a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to respond to the breach and could result in a disruption of our operations 

in addition states and the federal government are increasingly enacting laws and regulations relating to data breaches and theft of employee and customer data these laws will likely increase the costs of doing business and if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these new laws we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies which could harm our business 

our business and operations could suffer material losses in the event of system interruptions or failures 

our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties serve an important role in the operation and administration of our business these systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources including but not limited to human error cybersecurity attacks computer viruses unauthorized access fire flood power outages telecommunication failures facility or equipment damage natural disasters terrorism and war in addition we continually make investments in technology to implement new processes and systems as well as to maintain and update our existing processes and systems implementing process and system changes increases the risk of disruption if our information technology systems are interrupted or fail and our redundant systems or recovery plans are not adequate to address such interruptions or failures on a timely basis our revenues and profits could be reduced and the reputation of our brand and our business could be materially adversely affected additionally remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant unplanned expenses 

as customerfacing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our sales and marketing strategy the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences 

through our continued information technology enhancements we are able to provide an improved overall shopping environment and an omnichannel experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers tablets smart phones and other mobile communication devices we use our website both as a sales channel for our products and also as a method of providing product project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both instore and online sales omnichannel retailing is continually evolving and expanding and we must effectively respond to changing customer expectations and new developments disruptions failures or other performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and instore business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers 

if we are unable to maintain or upgrade our management information systems and software programs or if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient and our strategic business initiatives may not be successful 

we depend on management information systems for many aspects of our business we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that we can continue to support our business we could be materially adversely affected if we experienced a disruption or data loss relating to our management information systems and are unable to recover timely we could also be adversely impacted if we are unable to improve upgrade maintain and expand our management information systems particularly in light of the contemplated continued store growth 

the success of our strategic business initiatives designed to increase our sales and improve margin is dependent in varying degrees on the timely delivery and the functionality of information technology systems to support them extended delays or cost overruns in securing developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support the strategic business initiatives would delay and possibly even prevent us from realizing the projected benefits of those initiatives 

we cannot provide any guaranty of future dividend payments or that we will continue to repurchase our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program 

although our board of directors has indicated an intention to pay future quarterly cash dividends on our common stock any determination to pay or increase cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be based primarily upon our financial condition results of operations business requirements and our board of directors’ continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our stockholders and is in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the dividend furthermore although our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of up to 3 billion through december 2020 we may discontinue this program at any time or significantly reduce repurchases under the program 

the market price for our common stock might be volatile and could result in a decline in value 

the price at which our common stock trades may be volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to our operating results general trends and prospects for the retail industry announcements by our competitors analyst recommendations our ability to meet or exceed analysts’ or investors’ expectations the condition of the financial markets and other factors the company’s stock price is dependent in part on the multiple of earnings that investors are willing to pay that multiple is in part dependent on investors’ perception of the company’s future earnings growth prospects if investor perceptions of the company’s earnings growth prospects change the company’s earnings multiple may decline and its stock price could be adversely affected 

in addition the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies these fluctuations as well as general economic and market conditions may adversely affect the market price of our common stock notwithstanding our actual operating performance 

our costs of doing business could increase as a result of federal state local or foreign laws and regulations 

we are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and governmental regulations including those relating to environmental protection personal injury intellectual property consumer product safety building land use and zoning requirements workplace regulations wage and hour privacy and information security and employment law matters if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations or if these laws or regulations are violated by importers manufacturers or distributors we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

we are also subject to the foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” which prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business and the antibribery laws of other jurisdictions failure to comply with the fcpa and similar laws could subject us to among other things penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

potential noncompliance with environmental regulations could materially impact our results of operations or financial condition 

our business is subject to various federal state and local laws regulations and other requirements pertaining to protection of the environment and public health including for example regulations governing the management of waste materials and waste waters governmental agencies on the federal state and local levels have in recent years increasingly focused on the retail sector’s compliance with such laws and regulations and have at times pursued enforcement activities we periodically receive information requests and notices of potential noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations from governmental agencies which are addressed on a casebycase basis with the relevant agency any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

effective tax rate changes and results of examinations by taxing authorities could materially impact our results 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by legislative tax reform changes in statutory rates or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof additionally our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the earnings mix being lower than historical results in states where we have lower statutory rates and higher than historical results in states where we have higher statutory rates or by changes in the measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 

we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the internal revenue service “irs” as well as state and local taxing authorities like many retailers a portion of our sales are to taxexempt customers the business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment these circumstances create risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance our results could be materially impacted by the determinations and expenses related to these and other proceedings by the irs and other state and local taxing authorities

 item 3  legal proceedings 

item 103 of sec regulation sk requires disclosure of certain environmental legal proceedings if the proceeding reasonably involves potential monetary sanctions of 100000 or more we periodically receive information requests and notices of potential noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations from governmental agencies which are addressed on a casebycase basis with the relevant agency the company received a subpoena from the district attorney of yolo county california requesting records and information regarding its hazardous waste management and disposal practices in california the company and the office of the district attorney of yolo county engaged in settlement discussions which resulted in the settlement of the matter a consent decree reflecting the terms of settlement was filed with the yolo county superior court on june 23 2017 under the settlement the company agreed to a compliance plan and also agreed to pay a civil penalty and fund supplemental environmental projects furthering consumer protection and environmental enforcement in california the civil penalty did not differ materially from the amount accrued the cost of the settlement and the compliance with the consent decree will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

significant accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our financial position andor results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 













quarterly financial data 

our unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2017  and 2016  are shown below in thousands except per share amounts 





a   comparable store metrics are calculated using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales excluding certain adjustments to net sales closed stores are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations stores relocated during the periods being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics if the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics becomes material we would remove relocated stores from the calculations acquired petsense stores are considered comparable stores beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 

b beginning in the fourth quarter ended december 31 2016 selected financial and operating information includes the consolidation of petsense unless otherwise noted 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales 



a   our gross margin amounts may not be comparable to those of other retailers since some retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of merchandise sold and others like our company exclude a portion of these distribution network costs from gross margin and instead include them in selling general and administrative expenses refer to note 1 – significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016   

net sales increased   70  to 726 billion  in fiscal 2017  from 678 billion  in fiscal 2016  the prior year included an extra sales week as a part of the company’s 53week calendar in 2016 which negatively impacted the overall sales increase by approximately 16 percentage points comparable store sales for fiscal 2017  were 685 billion  a 27   increase  over fiscal 2016  this compares to a 16  comparable store sales increase in the prior year the comparable store transaction count increased   22  and comparable store average ticket increased 05  for fiscal 2017  

comparable store metrics are calculated on an annual basis using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales excluding certain adjustments to net sales stores closed during the year are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations stores relocated during the years being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics if the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics becomes material we would remove relocated stores from the calculations acquired petsense stores are considered comparable beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 

the comparable store sales increase was driven by an increase in traffic counts and the yearround strength of consumable usable and edible cue products primarily animal and petrelated merchandise warmer than normal weather patterns early in the first quarter negatively impacted the sales of winter seasonal items and winter storms in march had an unfavorable impact on the start to the spring selling season beginning in the second quarter we experienced broadbased improvement through the remainder of the year in all geographic regions and major product categories driven by strength in sales of everyday basic items in cue and yearround products the third quarter experienced an additional benefit from an extended spring and summer selling season and strong sales of emergency response products related to hurricanes during the quarter while the fourth quarter experienced an additional benefit from solid sales in cold weather and other seasonal products 

in addition to comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2017  sales from stores opened less than one year including petsense were 4050 million  in fiscal 2017  which represented 60  percentage points of the 70  increase over fiscal 2016  net sales sales from stores opened less than one year including petsense were 3789 million  in fiscal 2016  which represented 61  percentage points of the 89  increase over fiscal 2015  net sales 

the following table summarizes our store growth during fiscal 2017  and 2016  



the following table indicates the percentage of net sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2017  and 2016  



gross profit increased   72  to 249 billion  in fiscal 2017  compared to 233 billion  in fiscal 2016  as a percent of net sales gross margin remained flat to prior year at 343  gross margin percentage was negatively impacted by higher markdowns on cold weather merchandise and targeted promotional activity in the first quarter as well as a higher freight expense throughout the year due to higher carrier costs increased average fuel costs and a shift in product mix towards more freight intensive products these declines in gross margin were offset by strong sellthrough rates and solid price and inventory management particularly in the back half of the year 

total selling general and administrative “sga” expenses including depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2017   increased   107  to 181 billion  from 163 billion  in fiscal 2016  sga expenses as a percent of net sales increased   80  basis points to 249  in fiscal 2017  from 241  in fiscal 2016  the increase in sga as a percent of net sales was primarily attributable to higher store payroll from wage inflation and our continued effort to enhance customer service increased incentive compensation at the store level from the strong yearoveryear growth in comparable store sales the deleverage of occupancy and other fixed costs resulting from the integration of petsense expenses and the 53 rd week of sales in fiscal 2016 that did not reoccur in fiscal 2017 and investments in infrastructure and technology to support our strategic longterm growth initiatives 

our effective tax rate increased  to 372  for fiscal 2017  compared to 365  in fiscal 2016  on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cut and jobs act the “act” the act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code including but not limited to a reduction of the federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects of the act on our existing deferred tax balances as of december 30 2017 and recognized a provisional amount of 49 million which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations however we are still analyzing certain aspects of the act and refining our calculations which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances in future periods excluding the impacts of the act our effective income tax rate in 2017 would have been 364 

for fiscal 2017  net income was 4226 million  or 330  per diluted share compared to 4371 million  or 327  per diluted share in fiscal 2016  excluding the impact of the revaluation of the company’s net deferred tax asset resulting in a onetime noncash charge of approximately 49 million or 003 per diluted share adjusted net income for fiscal 2017 was 4275 million or 333 per diluted share adjusted net income is a nongaap measure which has been provided in order to enhance comparability for the periods presented 

during fiscal 2017  we repurchased approximately 59 million  shares of the company’s common stock at a total cost of 3694 million  as part of our 3 billion  share repurchase program in fiscal 2016  we repurchased approximately 44 million  shares at a total cost of 3317 million  

fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015   

net sales increased 89 to 678 billion in fiscal 2016 from 623 billion in fiscal 2015 the fourth quarter included an extra sales week as a part of the company’s 53week calendar in 2016 which represented 16 percentage points of the overall 89 sales increase over prior year comparable store sales for fiscal 2016 were 641 billion a 16 increase over fiscal 2015 this compares to a 31 comparable store sales increase in the prior year the comparable store transaction count increased 26 while comparable store average ticket decreased 09 for fiscal 2016 

comparable store metrics are calculated on an annual basis using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales excluding certain adjustments to net sales stores closed during the year are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations stores relocated during the years being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics if 

the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics becomes material we would remove relocated stores from the calculations petsense stores are not considered comparable stores until 12 months after the date of acquisition 

the comparable store sales increase was driven by an increase in traffic counts and the yearround strength of cue products principally animal and petrelated merchandise livestock equipment and hardline products such as fencing and trailers also performed well throughout the year the full year sales performance was negatively impacted by unpredictable weather patterns during the spring selling season and unseasonably warm weather in the key cold months of the year which drove softness in cold weather seasonal categories and big ticket items such as log splitters and stoves additionally the company believes that economic conditions in the energy producing markets negatively impacted consumer spending primarily in the midwest and south central regions 

in addition to comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2016 sales from stores opened less than one year including petsense were 3789 million in fiscal 2016 which represented 61 percentage points of the 89 increase over fiscal 2015 net sales sales from stores opened less than one year were 3510 million in fiscal 2015 which represented 61 percentage points of the 90 increase over fiscal 2014 net sales 

the following table summarizes our store growth during fiscal 2016 and 2015 



the following table indicates the percentage of net sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2016 and 2015 



gross profit increased 85 to 233 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to 214 billion in fiscal 2015 as a percent of net sales gross margin decreased 10 basis points to 343 for fiscal 2016 compared to 344 for fiscal 2015 this decrease in gross margin percentage principally reflects a higher mix of cue products which generally carry below chain average gross margin partially offset by benefits from our key margin driving initiatives freight expense as a percent of net sales experienced a marginal increase in fiscal 2016 as compared to the prior year due principally to an increase in inbound miles and domestic transportation costs partially offset by lower diesel fuel prices and import container costs 

sga expenses including depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales increased 10 basis points to 241 in fiscal 2016 from 240 in fiscal 2015 sga expenses as a percent of net sales increased due to incremental costs associated with our 

new distribution facilities that began operations in late fiscal 2015 as well as acquisition and operating expenses associated with the petsense purchase these increases were partially offset by leverage of occupancy costs from the 53 rd week of sales in fiscal 2016 as well as lower yearoveryear incentive compensation expense total sga expenses including depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2016 increased 93 to 163 billion from 149 billion in fiscal 2015 the increase in sga expenses primarily reflects new store growth incremental costs from operating the new distribution facilities variable costs associated with our comparable store sales growth and the extra sales week during the year and incremental expenses associated with the petsense acquisition and its operations 

our effective tax rate decreased to 365 for fiscal 2016 compared to 366 in fiscal 2015 the decrease in the effective income tax rate was due principally to the availability of federal and state tax incentives 

as a result of the foregoing factors net income for fiscal 2016 increased 65 to 4371 million or 327 per diluted share as compared to net income of 4104 million or 300 per diluted share in fiscal 2015 

during fiscal 2016 we repurchased approximately 44 million shares of the company’s common stock at a total cost of 3317 million as part of our 3 billion share repurchase program in fiscal 2015 we repurchased approximately 34 million shares at a total cost of 2927 million 

fiscal 2018 outlook 

our guidance for fiscal 2018  anticipates net sales of 769 billion to 777 billion reflecting a comparable store sales increase of 20 to 30 as well as the opening of approximately 80  tractor supply stores and 20 petsense stores at the midpoint of our guidance range we anticipate that operating profit as a percentage of net sales will decrease from 94 in fiscal 2017 to 88 in fiscal 2018 included in this estimate are anticipated cost pressures associated with rising diesel fuel prices and transportation costs wage investments for our team members in our stores and distribution centers investments to support our growth strategy and incremental preopening and other operating expenses from our new distribution center which is currently under construction in frankfort new york lastly as a result of the act reducing the statutory federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 is expected to range from 230 to 235 as a result of the foregoing factors we estimate net income for fiscal 2018 of 490 million to 515 million or 395 to 415 per diluted share 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

in addition to normal operating expenses our primary ongoing cash requirements are for new store expansion remodeling and relocation programs distribution facility capacity and improvements information technology inventory purchases repayment of 

existing borrowings under our debt facilities share repurchases cash dividends and selective acquisitions as opportunities arise 

our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are existing cash balances cash provided from operations remaining funds available under our debt facilities capital and operating leases and normal trade credit our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters to support the higher sales volume of the spring and coldweather selling seasons respectively 

we believe that our existing cash balances expected cash flow from future operations funds available under our debt facilities operating and capital leases and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs including new store openings store acquisitions relocations and renovations and distribution facility capacity through the end of fiscal 2018 

working capital 

at december 30 2017  the company had working capital of 8062 million  which increased   656 million  from december 31 2016  the shifts in working capital were attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities in millions

sources and uses of cash 

our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and funds available under our debt facilities principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures and selective acquisitions while principal uses of cash for financing activities are repurchase of the company’s common stock and cash dividends paid to stockholders 

the following table presents a summary of cash flows provided by or used in operating investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years in millions 



a as a result of the adoption of asu 201609 discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements excess tax benefits on stock options exercised are no longer presented as a separate line item in the statement of cash flows the presentation of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 have been adjusted to conform to the current presentation

the 192 million   decrease  in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017  compared with fiscal 2016  primarily reflects the timing of receipts and payments in relation to inventory and accounts payable partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization due to new store growth and investments in information technology and infrastructure

the 1945 million  increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016  compared with fiscal 2015  primarily reflects incremental profitability and the impact of effective management of inventory and accounts payable levels average inventory per store decreased yearoveryear principally due to an improvement in inventory turns of seasonal and coldweather merchandise at the end of fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 additionally the timing of payments to vendors more closely aligned with receipt of inventory at the end of fiscal 2016 in comparison with the end of fiscal 2015 resulting in an improvement in cash flow yearoveryear

a as a result of the adoption of asu 201609 discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements excess tax benefits on stock options exercised are no longer presented as a separate line item in the statement of cash flows the presentation of fiscal 2016 has been adjusted to conform to the current presentation 

the increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  is largely due to incremental share repurchases of common stock and a reduction in proceeds from the issuance of common stock partially offset by an increase in borrowings net of repayments under our debt facilities 

the 837 million  increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  was due to changes in the following in millions 



a as a result of the adoption of asu 201609 discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements excess tax benefits on stock options exercised are no longer presented as a separate line item in the statement of cash flows the presentation of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 has been adjusted to conform to the current presentation 

the increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  is due to incremental share repurchases of common stock fewer borrowings net of repayments under our debt facilities and an increase in quarterly cash dividends paid to stockholders 

repurchase of common stock 

the company’s board of directors has authorized common stock repurchases under a share repurchase program of up to 3 billion  exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses related to such repurchases through december 31 2020  the repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions the timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors including price corporate and regulatory requirements capital availability and other market conditions repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance the program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice 

we repurchased approximately 59 million  44 million  and 34 million  shares of common stock under the share repurchase program at a total cost of 3694 million  3317 million  and 2927 million  in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively as of december 30 2017  we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of 09 billion  exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses 

cash dividends paid to stockholders 

we paid cash dividends totaling 1338 million  1223 million  and 1031 million  in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively in fiscal 2017  we declared and paid cash dividends to stockholders of 105  per common share outstanding as compared to 092  and 076  per common share outstanding in fiscal 2016  and fiscal 2015  respectively these payments reflect an increase in the quarterly dividend in the second quarter of fiscal 2017  to 027 per share from 024 per share and an increase in the quarterly dividend in the second quarter of fiscal 2016  to 024 per share from 020 per share 

it is the present intention of the board of directors to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend however the declaration and payment of future dividends will be determined by the board of directors in its sole discretion and will depend upon the earnings financial condition and capital needs of the company as well as other factors which the board of directors deem relevant 

significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of december 30 2017  in thousands 



a capital lease obligations include related interest 

b longterm debt obligations include an estimate of related interest after consideration of the interest rate swap agreements see notes 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our interest rates 

c  represents contractual commitments related to the ongoing construction of a new distribution center in frankfort new york and the expansion of our existing distribution center in waverly nebraska 

at december 30 2017  there were 396 million  outstanding letters of credit under the 2016 senior credit facility 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements are limited to operating leases and outstanding letters of credit the balances for these arrangements are previously discussed we typically lease buildings for retail stores rather than acquiring these assets through purchases letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory primarily sourced overseas in a timely manner and support certain risk management programs 

new accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of december 30 2017  




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of borrowings under our 2016 senior credit facility as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements which bear interest based on variable rates 

as discussed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements we entered into interest rate swap agreements which are intended to mitigate interest rate risk associated with future changes in interest rates for the term loan borrowings under the 2016 senior credit facility as a result of the interest rate swaps our exposure to interest rate volatility is minimized the interest rate swap agreements have been executed for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposes 

a 1 change in interest rates on our variable rate debt in excess of that amount covered by the interest rate swaps would have affected interest expense by approximately 21 million 15 million and 11 million in the fiscal years ended december 30 2017  december 31 2016  and december 26 2015  respectively as of december 30 2017 we have no outstanding variable rate debt other than the borrowings which are covered by interest rate swaps therefore on a prospective basis a 1 change in interest rates on our variable rate debt in excess of that amount covered by the interest rate swaps would result in no additional interest expense 

purchase price volatility 

although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items grain corn steel petroleum cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services therefore we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost which may impact consumer demand and as a result sales and gross margin our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale from increased volume of purchases adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality

business strategy 

we believe our sales and earnings growth is the result of executing our business strategy which includes the following key components 

  

market niche 

we have identified a specialized market niche supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and others who enjoy the rural lifestyle as well as tradesmen and small businesses by focusing our product assortment on these core customers we believe we are differentiated from general merchandise home center and other specialty retailers we cater to the rural lifestyle and often serve a market by being a trip consolidator for many basic maintenance needs for farm ranch and rural customers 

customers 

our target customers are home land pet and livestock owners who generally have above average income and below average cost of living we seek to serve a customer base that primarily lives in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities this customer base includes recreational farmers and ranchers and others who enjoy the rural lifestyle as well as tradesmen and small businesses

we use a third party provider to measure our level of customer service this process allows customers to provide feedback on their shopping experience based on the third party provider’s data we believe our customer satisfaction scores to be among the bestinclass we carefully evaluate the feedback we receive from our customers and implement improvements at the individual store level based on that feedback 

store personnel and training 

we seek to hire store team members with farming and ranching backgrounds with particular emphasis on general maintenance equine and welding we endeavor to staff our stores with courteous highly motivated team members and devote considerable resources to training store team members often in cooperation with our vendors our training programs include 

 

store environment 

our stores are designed and managed to make shopping an enjoyable experience and to maximize sales and operating efficiencies stores are strategically arranged to provide an open environment for optimal product placement and visual display in addition these layouts allow for departmental space to be easily reallocated and visual displays to be changed for seasonal products and promotions display and product placement information is routinely sent to stores to ensure quality and uniformity among the stores informative signs are located in key product categories to assist customers with purchasing decisions and merchandise location these signs provide customers with a comparison of product qualities clear pricing useful information regarding product benefits and suggestions for appropriate accessories our store layouts and visual displays are designed to provide our customers a feeling of familiarity and enhance the shopping experience also our store team members wear highly visible red vests aprons or smocks with nametags and our customer service and checkout counters are conveniently located near the front of the store 

merchandising and purchasing 

we offer an extensive assortment of products for those seeking to enjoy the out here  lifestyle as well as tradesmen and small businesses our product assortment is tailored to meet the needs of our customers in various geographic markets our full line of product offerings includes a broad selection of high quality reputable brand name and exclusive brand products and is supported by a strong instock inventory position with an average of 16000  to 20000  products per store no one product accounted for more than 10  of our sales during 2016  our comprehensive selection of merchandise is comprised of the following major product categories 

 

the following chart indicates the percentage of net sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  



our buying team continuously reviews and updates our product assortment to respond to customer needs and to offer new relevant products we are focused on providing key products that our customers use on a regular basis for their lifestyle and maintenance needs with emphasis on consumable usable and edible “cue” products examples of cue product categories include but are not limited to livestock feed and bedding pet food lubricants and various seasonal products such as heating pest control and twine 

our products are sourced through both domestic and international vendors our business is not dependent upon any one vendor or particular group of vendors we purchase our products from a group of approximately 850  vendors with no one vendor representing more than 10  of our purchases during fiscal 2016  approximately 300  core vendors accounted for 90  of our merchandise purchases during fiscal 2016  we have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative sources of supply for our products and we believe that adequate sources of supply exist at substantially similar costs for nearly all of our products we have no material longterm contractual commitments with any of our product vendors 

our buying teams focus on merchandise procurement vendor line reviews and testing of new products and programs we also employ a dedicated inventory management team that focuses exclusively on forecasting and inventory replenishment a committed merchandise planning team that concentrates on assortment planning and a specialized pricing team that seeks to optimize marketspecific pricing for our products through the combined efforts of these teams we continue to focus on improving our overall inventory productivity and instock position 

intellectual property 

our subsidiary tractor supply co of texas lp “tsct” owns registrations with the united states patent and trademark office “uspto” for various service marks including tsc ®  tractor supply co ®  tsc tractor supply co ®  and the trapezium design for retail store services we consider these service marks and the accompanying goodwill and name recognition to be valuable assets of our business tsct also owns several other service marks for retail services some of which have been registered with the uspto and some of which are the subject of applications for registration pending before the uspto 

in addition to selling products that bear nationallyknown manufacturer brands we also sell products manufactured for us under a number of exclusive brands that we consider to be important to our business these exclusive brands are manufactured for us by a number of vendors and provide an alternative to the national brands which helps provide value for our customers and positions us as a destination store 

our exclusive brands represented approximately 32  of our total sales in fiscal 2016  and approximately 31  of our total sales in fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014  our exclusive brands include 



the exclusive brands identified above have been registered as trademarks with the uspto for certain products and are the subject of applications for registration pending before the uspto for other products 

our trademark and service mark registrations have various expiration dates however provided that we continue to use the marks and renew the registrations in a timely manner the registrations are potentially perpetual in duration 

we believe our intellectual property which includes the trademarks and service marks identified above together with certain trade names domain names patents and copyrights has significant value and is an important component of our merchandising and marketing strategies 

distribution 

we currently operate a distribution network for supplying stores with merchandise and delivering product ordered through tractorsupplycom  in fiscal 2016  our tractor supply stores received approximately 75  of merchandise through this network while the remaining merchandise shipped directly to the stores from our vendors we believe this flow facilitates the prompt and efficient distribution of merchandise in order to enhance instocks minimize freight costs and improve the inventory turn rate our distribution facilities located in arizona georgia indiana kentucky maryland nebraska texas and washington represent total distribution capacity of 50 million  square feet in fiscal 2017 we plan to begin construction on a new northeast distribution 

center as well as an expansion of our existing distribution center in waverly nebraska which will provide additional distribution capacity once construction is completed 

we select the locations of our distribution facilities in an effort to minimize logistics costs and optimize the distance from distribution facilities to our stores our distribution centers utilize warehouse and labor management tools that support the planning control and processing of inventory we manage our inbound and outbound transportation activity inhouse through the use of a transportation management system we utilize multiple common carriers for store and direct to customer deliveries we manage our transportation costs through carrier negotiations the monitoring of transportation routes and the scheduling of deliveries 

marketing 

we utilize an “everyday value price” philosophy to consistently offer our products at competitive prices complemented by strategically planned promotions throughout the year to drive store traffic and position ourselves as a destination store we promote broad selections of merchandise with newspaper circulars customer targeted direct mail and email as well as digital and social media offerings vendors frequently support these specific programs by offering temporary cost reductions and honoring coupons our vendors also provide assistance with product presentation and fixture design brochures support for instore events and pointofpurchase materials for customer education and product knowledge for our team members 

omnichannel 

we communicate with our customers across multiple touch points including our stores ecommerce website  tractorsupplycom  email social media direct mail and our customer call center our goal is to be available at any time and in any way our customers choose to engage with our brand connecting with consumers online provides the opportunity for customers to shop at a time and place that fits their schedule while delivering enhanced product information research and decision tools that support product selection and informational needs in specific subject areas we give our customers the ability to purchase products and have them shipped to one of our retail stores their homes or offices in 2016 we also began offering in certain stores an option to buy online and pick up in store we believe our ecommerce capabilities further enhance customer service and extend our market to areas where our retail stores are not currently located we maintain a fulfillment center within our franklin kentucky distribution center to support our ecommerce activities additionally in 2016  we continued to invest in our omnichannel platform through expanded capabilities related to fulfillment options product information and site research we are focused on delivering an enhanced mobile and tablet experience improving the site response time and expanding our product offerings for vendor direct to customer shipments

growth strategy 

our current and longterm growth strategy is to 1 expand domestic geographic market presence through opening new retail stores 2 enhance financial performance through comparable store sales growth achieved through targeted merchandising and marketing programs with an “everyday value price” philosophy supported by strong customer service 3 enhance product margin through strategic product sourcing inventory and markdown management a strong exclusive brand offering and optimization of product pricing and transportation costs 4 leverage operating costs by focusing on opportunities for continuous improvement and elimination of waste in all of our processes 5 expand market opportunities via omnichannel enhancements tying together our website product content social media digital and online shopping experience and 6 expand through selective acquisitions as such opportunities arise to add complementary businesses and to enhance penetration into new and existing markets to supplement organic growth   

over the past five years we have experienced considerable sales growth resulting in a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 99  we plan to open approximately 100  new tractor supply and 25  to 30  new petsense stores in fiscal 2017  a selling square footage increase of approximately 66  in fiscal 2016  we opened 113  new tractor supply stores and began operating 143 petsense stores as compared to 114  new tractor supply stores in fiscal 2015  this represents a selling square footage increase of approximately 108  during fiscal 2016  and 80  during fiscal 2015  

at december 31 2016  we operated 1738  retail stores in 49  states  1595  tractor supply and del’s retail stores and 143  petsense retail stores given the size of the communities that we target we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in many existing and new markets we have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified approximately 900  additional markets for new tractor supply stores we also believe that there is opportunity for up to 1000 petsense stores approximately 54  of our tractor supply stores are in freestanding buildings and 46  are located in strip shopping centers we lease approximately 94  of our stores and own the remaining 6  

competition 

we operate in a competitive retail industry the principal competitive factors include location of stores fulfillment options price quality of merchandise instock consistency merchandise assortment and presentation product knowledge and customer service we compete with general merchandise retailers home center retailers specialty and discount retailers independently owned retail farm and ranch stores numerous privatelyheld regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives as well as internetbased retailers however we believe we successfully differentiate ourselves from many of these retailers by focusing on our specialized 

market niche for customers living the rural lifestyle see further discussion of competition in 1a “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10k 

seasonality and weather 

our business is seasonal historically our sales and profits are the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products we experience our highest inventory and accounts payable balances during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal products to support the higher sales volume of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter to support the higher sales volume of the coldweather selling season 

historically weather conditions including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and unseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months have affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations in addition extreme weather conditions including snow and ice storms flood and wind damage hurricanes tornadoes heavy rain and droughts have impacted operating results both negatively and positively depending on the severity and length of these conditions our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends 

stewardship and compliance with environmental matters 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment we are committed to complying with all applicable environmental laws and regulations we are also committed to becoming a more environmentally sustainable company this commitment is demonstrated through our stewardship program which is our environmental sustainability program through this program the company has implemented a number of initiatives designed to reduce our impact on the environment these initiatives include the installation of energy management systems led lighting high efficiency heatingair conditioning systems in our stores and recycling programs in our stores distribution facilities and the store support center our store support center opened in 2014 and our distribution center in casa grande arizona opened in 2015 were each awarded leed leadership in energy and environmental design silver certification for environmentally sustainable design construction and operation we also installed solar arrays at the store support center in brentwood tennessee and our store in hendersonville tennessee

our business faces many risks those risks of which we are currently aware and deem to be material are described below if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur our business financial condition or results of operations may significantly suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this form 10k 

general economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance 

our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending including discretionary spending a weakening of economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as lower employment levels uncertainty or changes in business or political conditions higher interest rates higher tax rates higher fuel and energy costs higher labor and healthcare costs the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to competitors a general reduction in the level of discretionary spending shifts in consumer discretionary spending to our competitors or shifts in discretionary spending to less profitable products sold by us could result in lower net sales slower inventory turnover greater markdowns on inventory and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins 

failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name 

our success depends in part on the value and strength of the tractor supply name the tractor supply name is integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business maintaining promoting and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide high quality merchandise and a consistent high quality customer experience our brand could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity failure to comply or accusation of failure to comply with ethical social product labor data privacy and environmental standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions any of these events could result in decreased revenue or otherwise adversely affect our business 

we may be unable to increase sales at our existing stores 

we experience fluctuations in our comparable store sales defined as sales in stores which have been open for at least twelve months various factors affect comparable store sales including the general retail sales environment our ability to efficiently source and distribute products changes in our merchandise assortment competition proximity of our locations to one another or to the locations of other retailers increased presence of online retailers current economic conditions customer satisfaction with our products the timing of promotional events the release of new merchandise the success of marketing programs and weather conditions these factors may cause our comparable store sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations past comparable store sales are not an indication of future results and there can be no assurance that our comparable store sales will not decrease in the future 

purchase price volatility including inflationary and deflationary pressures may adversely affect our financial performance 

although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items grain corn steel petroleum cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services therefore we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost which may impact consumer demand and as a result sales and gross margin our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale from increased volume of purchases adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors while maintaining product quality should our strategy to mitigate purchase price volatility not be effective our financial performance could be adversely impacted 

weather conditions may have a significant impact on our financial results 

weather conditions affect the demand for and in some cases the supply of products which in turn has an impact on prices historically weather conditions including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and unseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months have affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations in addition extreme weather conditions including snow and ice storms flood and wind damage hurricanes tornadoes extreme rain and droughts have impacted operating results while extreme weather conditions can positively impact our operating results by increasing demand in affected locations for products needed to cope with the weather condition and its effects they can also negatively affect our business depending on the severity and length of these conditions as a result of store closings or the inability of customers to shop at our stores due to weather conditions our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends should such a strategy not be effective the weather may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our merchandising and marketing initiatives may not provide expected results 

we believe our past performance has been based on and future success will depend upon in part the ability to develop and execute merchandising initiatives with effective marketing programs these merchandising initiatives and marketing programs may not deliver expected results and there is no assurance that we will correctly identify and respond in a timely manner to evolving trends and consumer preferences and expectations if we misjudge the market or our marketing programs are not successful we may overstock unpopular products and be forced to take inventory price reductions that have a material adverse effect on our profitability failure to execute and promote such initiatives in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow the business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition shortages of key merchandise could also have a material adverse impact on operating results and financial condition 

capital required for growth may not be available 

the construction or acquisition of new stores store support center facilities distribution facilities or other facilities the remodeling and renovation of existing facilities and investments in information technology require significant amounts of capital in the past our growth has been funded through internally generated cash flow and bank borrowings disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the ability of the banks to meet their commitments our access to funds under our senior credit facility as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time in addition tight lending practices may make it difficult for our real estate developers to obtain financing under acceptable 

loan terms and conditions unfavorable lending practices could impact the timing of our store openings and materially adversely affect our ability to open new stores in desirable locations 

longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty changing or increased regulation reduced funding alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases cash dividends or other discretionary uses of cash 

failure to open and manage new stores in the number and manner currently contemplated could adversely affect our financial performance 

an integral part of our business strategy includes the expansion of our store base through new store openings this expansion strategy is dependent on our ability to find suitable locations and we face competition from many retailers for such sites if we are unable to implement this strategy our ability to increase our sales profitability and cash flow could be impaired significantly to the extent that we are unable to open new stores in the manner we anticipate due to among other reasons site approval or unforeseen delays in construction our sales growth may be impeded 

as we execute this expansion strategy we may also experience managerial or operational challenges which may prevent any expected increase in sales profitability or cash flow our ability to manage our planned expansion depends on the adequacy of our existing information systems the efficiency and expansion of our distribution systems the adequacy of the hiring and training process for new personnel especially store managers the effectiveness of our controls and procedures and the ability to identify customer demand and build market awareness in different geographic areas there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our planned expansion that the new stores will be effectively integrated into our existing operations or that such stores will be profitable 

although we have a rigorous real estate site selection and approval process there can be no assurance that our new store openings will be successful or result in incremental sales and profitability for the company new stores build their sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection over time and as a result generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our more mature stores as we continue to open new stores there may be a negative impact on our results from a lower contribution margin of these new stores until their sales levels ramp to chain average if at all as well as from the impact of related preopening costs 

we may pursue strategic acquisitions and the failure of an acquisition to produce the anticipated results or the inability to fully integrate the acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business 

we may from time to time acquire businesses we believe to be complementary to our business the success of an acquisition is based on our ability to make accurate assumptions regarding the valuation operations growth potential integration and other factors relating to the target business acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and may result in the diversion of our capital and our management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities we may not be able to successfully integrate operations that we acquire including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures if we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions we could experience increased costs associated with operating inefficiencies which could have an adverse effect on our financial results also while we employ several different methodologies to assess potential business opportunities the new businesses may not meet our expectations and therefore adversely affect our financial performance 

competition may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations 

we operate in the highly competitive retail merchandise sector with numerous competitors these competitors include general merchandise retailers home center retailers specialty and discount retailers independently owned retail farm and ranch stores numerous privatelyheld regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives as well as internetbased retailers we compete for customers merchandise real estate locations and employees this competitive environment subjects us to various other risks including the inability to continue our store and sales growth and to provide attractive merchandise to our customers at competitive prices that allow us to maintain our profitability our failure to compete effectively in this environment could adversely impact our financial performance 

we face risks associated with vendors from whom our products are sourced 

the products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors we have agreements with our vendors in which the vendors agree to comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and to indemnify us against certain liabilities and costs our ability to recover liabilities and costs under these vendor agreements is dependent upon the financial condition and integrity of the vendors we rely on longterm relationships with our suppliers but have no longterm contracts with such suppliers our future success will depend in large measure upon our ability to maintain our existing supplier relationships or to develop new ones this reliance exposes us to the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various products due to political economic social or environmental conditions transportation delays or changes in laws and regulations affecting distribution our vendors may be forced to reduce their production shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection which could make it difficult for us to serve the market’s needs and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we rely on foreign manufacturers for various products that we sell in addition many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources as an importer our business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business internationally such as domestic and foreign governmental regulations economic disruptions delays in shipments transportation capacity and costs currency exchange rates and changes in political or economic conditions in countries from which we purchase products if any such factors were to render the conduct of business in particular countries undesirable or impractical or if additional united states quotas duties taxes or other charges or restrictions were imposed upon the importation of our products in the future our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

the results of the november 2016 elections in the united states have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies tariffs and regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries we source a significant portion of our merchandise from manufacturers located outside the united states primarily in asia and central america major developments in tax policy or trade relations such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise or the imposition of tariffs on imported products could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and liquidity 

we are subject to personal injury workers’ compensation product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business 

our business involves a risk of personal injury workers’ compensation product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business product liability claims from customers and product recalls for merchandise alleged to be defective or harmful could lead to the disposal or writeoff of merchandise inventories the incurrence of fines or penalties and damage to our reputation we maintain general liability and workers’ compensation insurance with a selfinsured retention for each policy type and a deductible for each occurrence we also maintain umbrella limits above the primary general liability and product liability coverage in many cases we have indemnification rights against the manufacturers of the products and their products liability insurance as well as the property owners of our leased buildings our ability to recover costs and damages under such insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject to the financial viability of the insurers manufacturers and landlords and the specific allegations of a claim no assurance can be given that our insurance coverage or the manufacturers’ or landlords’ indemnity will be available or sufficient in any claims brought against us 

our failure to attract and retain qualified team members could adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to continue expanding operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified team members our ability to meet labor needs while controlling wage and related labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force unemployment levels prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation if we are unable to locate attract or retain qualified personnel or if costs of labor or related costs increase significantly our financial performance could be adversely affected 

failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business and results 

the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting an internal control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that 

the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all internal 

control systems internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our business customers employees and vendors that we hold whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise could damage our reputation with customers employees and vendors could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation and could adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity 

we receive certain personal and other confidential information about our customers employees and vendors we also rely on business partners to provide services to us that may include important business information or data about our customers employees and vendors in addition our online operations at tractorsupplycom  depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments while we maintain substantial security measures to protect and to prevent unauthorized access to such information it is possible that unauthorized parties through cyberattacks which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated or by other means might compromise our security measures and obtain and misuse the personal information of customers employees and vendors that we hold or other confidential company data it is possible that such a compromise could go undetected by us such an occurrence could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers employees and vendors as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in significant legal and financial exposure beyond the scope or limits of insurance coverage moreover a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to respond to the breach and could result in a disruption of our operations 

in addition states and the federal government are increasingly enacting laws and regulations relating to data breaches and theft of employee and customer data these laws will likely increase the costs of doing business and if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these new laws we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies which could harm our business 

as customerfacing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our sales and marketing strategy the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences 

through our continued information technology enhancements we are able to provide an improved overall shopping environment and an omnichannel experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers tablets smart phones and other mobile communication devices we use our website both as a sales channel for our products and also as a method of providing product project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both instore and online sales omnichannel retailing is continually evolving and expanding and we must effectively respond to changing customer expectations and new developments disruptions failures or other performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and instore business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers 

if we are unable to maintain or upgrade our management information systems and software programs or if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient and our strategic business initiatives may not be successful 

we depend on management information systems for many aspects of our business we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that we can continue to support our business we could be materially adversely affected if we experienced a disruption or data loss relating to our management information systems and are unable to recover timely we could also be adversely impacted if we are unable to improve upgrade maintain and expand our management information systems particularly in light of the contemplated continued store growth 

the success of our strategic business initiatives designed to increase our sales and improve margin is dependent in varying degrees on the timely delivery and the functionality of information technology systems to support them extended delays or cost overruns in securing developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support the strategic business initiatives would delay and possibly even prevent us from realizing the projected benefits of those initiatives 

a significant disruption to our distribution network or to the timely receipt of inventory could adversely impact sales or increase our transportation costs which would decrease our profits 

we rely on our distribution and transportation network to provide goods to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner through deliveries to our distribution facilities from vendors and then from the distribution facilities or direct ship vendors to our stores by various means of transportation including shipments by sea air rail and truck any disruption unanticipated expense or operational 

failure related to this process could affect store operations negatively for example unexpected delivery delays including delays due to weather fuel shortages or other reasons or increases in transportation costs including increased fuel costs or a decrease in transportation capacity for overseas shipments could significantly decrease our ability to provide adequate product for sale resulting in lower sales and profitability in addition labor shortages or work stoppages in the transportation industry or longterm disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries could 

negatively affect our business also a fire tornado or other disaster at one of our distribution facilities could disrupt our timely receiving processing and shipment of merchandise to our stores which could adversely affect our business 

the implementation of our supply chain initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail 

we maintain a network of distribution facilities and have plans to build new facilities to support our growth objectives delays in opening distribution facilities could adversely affect our future operations by slowing store growth which may in turn reduce revenue growth in addition distributionrelated construction or expansion projects entail risks which could cause delays and cost overruns such as shortages of materials shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages unforeseen construction scheduling engineering environmental or geological problems weather interference fires or other casualty losses and unanticipated cost increases the completion date and ultimate cost of future projects could differ significantly from initial expectations due to constructionrelated or other reasons we cannot guarantee that all projects will be completed on time or within established budgets 

we continue to make significant technology investments in our supply chain these initiatives are designed to streamline our distribution process so that we can optimize the delivery of goods and services to our stores and distribution facilities in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives including those associated with managing thirdparty service providers and employing new webbased tools and services could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term in addition our improved supply chain technology might not provide the anticipated benefits it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the initiatives might fail altogether 

we cannot provide any guaranty of future dividend payments or that we will continue to repurchase our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program 

although our board of directors has indicated an intention to pay future quarterly cash dividends on our common stock any determination to pay or increase cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be based primarily upon our financial condition results of operations business requirements and our board of directors’ continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our stockholders and is in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the dividend furthermore although our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of up to 3 billion through december 2020 we may discontinue this program at any time 

the market price for our common stock might be volatile and could result in a decline in value 

the price at which our common stock trades may be volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to our operating results general trends and prospects for the retail industry announcements by our competitors analyst recommendations our ability to meet or exceed analysts’ or investors’ expectations the condition of the financial markets and other factors the company’s stock price is dependent in part on the multiple of earnings that investors are willing to pay that multiple is in part dependent on investors’ perception of the company’s future earnings growth prospects if investor perceptions of the company’s earnings growth prospects change the company’s earnings multiple may decline and its stock price could be adversely affected 

in addition the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies these fluctuations as well as general economic and market conditions may adversely affect the market price of our common stock notwithstanding our actual operating performance 

our costs of doing business could increase as a result of federal state local or foreign laws and regulations 

we are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and governmental regulations including those relating to environmental protection personal injury intellectual property consumer product safety building land use and zoning requirements workplace regulations wage and hour privacy and information security and employment law matters if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations or if these laws or regulations are violated by importers manufacturers or distributors we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

we are also subject to the foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” which prohibits united states companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business and the antibribery laws of other jurisdictions failure to comply with the fcpa and similar laws could subject us to among other things 

penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

potential noncompliance with environmental regulations could materially impact our results of operations or financial condition 

our business is subject to various federal state and local laws regulations and other requirements pertaining to protection of the environment and public health including for example regulations governing the management of waste materials and waste waters governmental agencies on the federal state and local levels have in recent years increasingly focused on the retail sector’s compliance with such laws and regulations and have at times pursued enforcement activities we periodically receive information requests and notices of potential noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations from governmental agencies which are addressed on a casebycase basis with the relevant agency any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

effective tax rate changes and results of examinations by taxing authorities could materially impact our results 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by legislative tax reform changes in statutory rates or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof additionally our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the earnings mix being lower than historical results in states where we have lower statutory rates and higher than historical results in states where we have higher statutory rates or by changes in the measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 

we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the internal revenue service “irs” as well as state and local taxing authorities like many retailers a portion of our sales are to taxexempt customers the business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment these circumstances create risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance our results could be materially impacted by the determinations and expenses related to these and other proceedings by the irs and other state and local taxing authorities

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales 



a   our gross margin amounts may not be comparable to those of other retailers since some retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of merchandise sold and others like our company exclude a portion of these distribution network costs from gross margin and instead include them in selling general and administrative expenses refer to note 1 – significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015   

net sales increased   89  to 678 billion  in fiscal 2016  from 623 billion  in fiscal 2015  the fourth quarter included an extra sales week as a part of the company’s 53week calendar in 2016 which represented 16 of the overall 89  sales increase over prior year comparable store sales for fiscal 2016  were 641 billion  a 16   increase  over fiscal 2015  this compares to a 31  comparable store sales increase in the prior year the comparable store transaction count increased   26  while comparable store average ticket decreased 09  for fiscal 2016  

comparable store metrics are calculated on an annual basis using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales excluding certain adjustments to net sales stores closed during the year are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations stores relocated during the years being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics if the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics becomes material we would remove relocated stores from the calculations petsense stores are not considered comparable stores until 12 months after the date of acquisition 

the comparable store sales increase was driven by an increase in traffic counts and the yearround strength of consumable usable and edible cue products principally animal and petrelated merchandise livestock equipment and hardline products such as fencing and trailers also performed well throughout the year the full year sales performance was negatively impacted by unpredictable weather patterns during the spring selling season and unseasonably warm weather in the key cold months of the year which drove softness in cold weather seasonal categories and big ticket items such as log splitters and stoves additionally the company believes that economic conditions in the energy producing markets negatively impacted consumer spending primarily in the midwest and south central regions 

in addition to comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2016  sales from stores opened less than one year including petsense were 3789 million  in fiscal 2016  which represented 61  percentage points of the 89  increase over fiscal 2015  net sales sales from stores opened less than one year were 3510 million  in fiscal 2015  which represented 61  percentage points of the 90  increase over fiscal 2014  net sales 

the following chart summarizes our store growth during fiscal 2016  and 2015

gross profit increased   85  to 233 billion  in fiscal 2016  compared to 214 billion  in fiscal 2015  as a percent of net sales gross margin decreased   10  basis points to 343  for fiscal 2016  compared to 344  for fiscal 2015  this decrease in gross margin percentage principally reflects a higher mix of cue products which generally carry below chain average gross margin partially offset by benefits from our key margin driving initiatives freight expense as a percent of net sales experienced a marginal increase in fiscal 2016 as compared to the prior year due principally to an increase in inbound miles and domestic transportation costs partially offset by lower diesel fuel prices and import container costs 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses including depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales increased   10  basis points to 241  in fiscal 2016  from 240  in fiscal 2015  sga expenses as a percent of net sales increased due to incremental costs associated with our new distribution facilities that began operations in late fiscal 2015 as well as acquisition and operating expenses associated with the petsense purchase these increases were partially offset by leverage of occupancy costs as well as lower yearoveryear incentive compensation expense total sga expenses including depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2016   increased   93  to 163 billion  from 149 billion  in fiscal 2015  the increase in sga expenses primarily reflects new store growth incremental costs from operating the new distribution facilities variable costs associated with our comparable store sales growth and the extra sales week during the year and incremental expenses associated with the petsense acquisition and its operations 

our effective tax rate decreased  to 365  for fiscal 2016  compared to 366  in fiscal 2015  the decrease in the effective income tax rate was due principally to the availability of federal and state tax incentives 

as a result of the foregoing factors net income for fiscal 2016   increased   65  to 4371 million  or 327  per diluted share as compared to net income of 4104 million  or 300  per diluted share in fiscal 2015

comparable store metrics are calculated on an annual basis using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales excluding certain adjustments to net sales beginning in fiscal 2015 stores closed during the year are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations this change in the calculation methodology did not have a material impact on the comparable store metrics reported in prior periods due to the minimal number of stores closed in those periods stores relocated during the years being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics if the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics becomes material we would remove relocated stores from the calculations 

the comparable store sales increase was driven by an increase in traffic counts and the yearround strength of cue products principally animal and petrelated merchandise hardline products such as fencing trailers and towing also performed well throughout the year the full year sales performance was negatively impacted by fourth quarter weakness in the key cold weather seasonal categories of heating stoves and fuel and insulated outerwear along with softness in seasonal big ticket items such as snow blowers log splitters and generators 

in addition to comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2015 sales from stores opened less than one year were 3510 million in fiscal 2015 which represented 61 percentage points of the 90 increase over fiscal 2014 net sales sales from stores opened less than one year were 3534 million in fiscal 2014 which represented 68 percentage points of the 106 increase over fiscal 2013 net sales

as a percent of net sales sga expenses including depreciation and amortization increased 20 basis points to 240 in fiscal 2015 from 238 in fiscal 2014 this increase in sga expense as a percent of net sales was mainly related to deleverage in rent and other occupancy costs at the stores and incremental costs associated with our two new mixing centers and our new distribution facility in casa grande arizona total sga expenses including depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2015 increased 97 to 149 billion from 136 billion in fiscal 2014 the increase in sga expense primarily reflects new store growth and variable costs associated with our comparable store sales growth 

our effective tax rate decreased to 366 for fiscal 2015 compared to 369 in fiscal 2014 predominantly as a result of the reversal of various reserves for uncertain tax positions 

as a result of the foregoing factors net income for fiscal 2015 increased 107 to 4104 million or 300 per diluted share as compared to net income of 3709 million or 266 per diluted share in fiscal 2014

sources and uses of cash 

our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and funds available under our senior credit facility as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures while principal uses of cash for financing activities are repurchase of the company’s common stock cash dividends paid to stockholders and selective acquisitions as opportunities arise 

the following table presents a summary of cash flows provided by or used in operating investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years in millions 



operating activities 

operating activities provided net cash of 6390 million  4292 million  and 4092 million  in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the 2098 million   increase  in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  was primarily due to changes in the following in millions 



the 2098 million   increase  in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016  compared with fiscal 2015  primarily reflects incremental profitability and the impact of effective management of inventory and accounts payable levels average inventory per store decreased yearoveryear principally due to an improvement in inventory turns of seasonal and coldweather merchandise at the end of fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 additionally the timing of payments to vendors more closely aligned with receipt of inventory at the end of fiscal 2016 in comparison with the end of fiscal 2015 resulting in an improvement in cash flow yearoveryear 

the 200 million  increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015  over fiscal 2014  was primarily due to changes in the following in millions 



the 200 million  increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015  compared with fiscal 2014  primarily reflects earnings growth the favorable impact from the timing of deferred taxes partially offset by a net increase in inventories and accounts payable inventory increased due to store growth the carryover of coldweather merchandise additional investment in cue 

products and the timing of spring seasonal receipts while accounts payable grew at a lower rate due mainly to the timing of payments 

investing activities 

investing activities used cash of 3693 million  2359 million  and 1603 million  in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the changes in cash used for investing activities primarily reflects the acquisition of petsense and changes in capital expenditures capital expenditures for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  were as follows in millions 



the above table reflects 113  new tractor supply stores and three  relocations as well as eight new petsense stores during fiscal 2016  114  new stores and six  relocations during fiscal 2015  and 107  new stores and two  relocations during fiscal 2014  the increase in spending on existing stores in fiscal 2016 primarily reflects an investment in the chainwide led lighting retrofit which will be completed in fiscal 2017 the sustained increase in spending on information technology represents continued support of our store growth and our omnichannel platform as well as improvements in security and compliance enhancements to our customer relationship management and other strategic initiatives spending for distribution center capacity and improvements increased substantially in fiscal 2015 as a result of the construction of two mixing centers in texas and the southwest distribution center in casa grande arizona all of which began operations in fiscal 2015 lastly the construction of our store support center in brentwood tennessee resulted in higher costs in fiscal 2014 for corporate and other spending 

we currently estimate that capital expenditures in fiscal 2017  will range between 270 million and 290 million 

 

financing activities 

financing activities used cash of 2797 million  1806 million  and 3405 million  in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2016  was mainly the result of repurchases of common stock and quarterly cash dividends paid to stockholders partially offset by net borrowings under the senior credit facility net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to sharebased compensation and excess tax benefits recognized on stock options exercised 

the increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  is largely due to incremental share repurchases of common stock and quarterly cash dividends paid to stockholders as well as a yearoveryear decrease in net borrowings under the senior credit facility and a reduced excess tax benefit recognized on stock options exercised the decrease in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  is largely due to 150 million of net borrowings under the senior credit facility 

the company’s board of directors has authorized common stock repurchases under a share repurchase program on october 31 2016 the board of directors authorized a 1 billion increase to the existing share repurchase program bringing the total amount authorized to 3 billion  exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses related to such repurchases and extended the program through december 31 2020 the repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions the timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors including price corporate and regulatory requirements capital availability and other market conditions repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance the program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice 

we repurchased approximately 44 million  34 million  and 47 million  shares of common stock under the share repurchase program at a total cost of 3317 million  2927 million  and 2985 million  in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively as of december 31 2016  we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of 12 billion  exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses 

in the second quarter of fiscal 2016  we increased our quarterly dividend from 020 per share to 024 per share and in the second quarter of fiscal 2015  we increased our quarterly dividend from 016 per share to 020 per share we paid dividends totaling   1223 million  1031 million  and 841 million  in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

we believe that our existing cash balances expected cash flow from future operations funds available under our senior credit facility operating and capital leases and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs including new store openings store acquisitions relocations and renovations and distribution facility capacity through the end of fiscal 2017

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu 201704 “intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment” this update simplifies the measurement of goodwill by eliminating the second step from the goodwill impairment test which requires the comparison of the implied fair value of goodwill with the current carrying amount of goodwill instead under the amendments in this guidance an entity shall perform a goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount and an impairment charge is to be recorded for the amount if any in which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value this guidance should be applied prospectively and is effective for public business entities that are united states securities and exchange commission filers for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 with early adoption permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed after january 1 2017   




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of borrowings under our senior credit facilities as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements which bear interest based on variable rates 

as discussed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements we entered into an interest rate swap agreement effective march 31 2016 which is intended to mitigate interest rate risk associated with future changes in interest rates for the term loan borrowings under the 2016 senior credit facility as a result of this interest rate swap our exposure to interest rate volatility is minimized beginning in the second fiscal quarter of 2016 the interest rate swap agreement has been executed for risk management purposes and is not held for trading purposes 

a 1 change in interest rates on our variable rate debt in excess of that amount covered by the interest rate swap would have 

affected interest expense by approximately 15 million 11 million and 07 million in the fiscal years ended december 31 2016 december 26 2015 and december 27 2014 respectively on a prospective basis a 1 change in interest rates on our variable rate debt in excess of that amount covered by the interest rate swap existing as of december 31 2016 would result in interest expense fluctuating approximately 09 million per year 

purchase price volatility 

although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items grain corn steel petroleum cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services therefore we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost which may impact consumer demand and as a result sales and gross margin our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale from increased volume of purchases adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality

business strategy 

we believe our sales and earnings growth are the result of executing our business strategy which includes the following key components 

  

market niche 

we have identified a specialized market niche supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and others who enjoy the rural lifestyle as well as tradesmen and small businesses by focusing our product assortment on these core customers we believe we are differentiated from general merchandise home center and other specialty retailers we cater to the rural lifestyle and often serve a market by being a trip consolidator for many basic maintenance needs for farm ranch and rural customers 

customers 

our target customers are home land pet and livestock owners who generally have above average income and below average cost of living we seek to serve a customer base that primarily lives in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities this customer base includes recreational farmers and ranchers and others who enjoy the rural lifestyle as well as tradesmen and small businesses 

customer service 

we are committed to providing our customers reliable product availability and a high level of instore service through our motivated welltrained store team members we believe the ability of our store team members to provide friendly responsive and seasoned advice helps our customers find the right products to satisfy their everyday needs in addition to the specialty items needed to complete their rural lifestyle projects we also engage with our customers through an ecommerce website  tractorsupplycom  which provides the opportunity to allow customers to shop at a time and place that fits their schedule while delivering enhanced product information research and decision tools that support product selection and informational needs in specific subject areas additionally we maintain a customer solutions center at our store support center located in brentwood tennessee to support our instore and online customers as well as our store team members we believe this commitment to customer service promotes strong customer loyalty and repeat shopping 

we use a third party provider to measure our level of customer service this process allows customers to provide feedback on their shopping experience based on the third party provider’s data we believe our customer satisfaction scores to be among the bestinclass we carefully evaluate the feedback we receive from our customers and implement improvements at the individual store level based on that feedback 

store personnel and training 

we seek to hire store team members with farming and ranching backgrounds with particular emphasis on general maintenance equine and welding we endeavor to staff our stores with courteous highly motivated team members and devote considerable resources to training store team members often in cooperation with our vendors our training programs include 

 

store environment 

our stores are designed and managed to make shopping an enjoyable experience and to maximize sales and operating efficiencies stores are strategically arranged to provide an open environment for optimal product placement and visual display in addition these layouts allow for departmental space to be easily reallocated and visual displays to be changed for seasonal products and promotions display and product placement information is sent to stores weekly to ensure quality and uniformity among the stores informative signs are located throughout each store to assist customers with purchasing decisions and merchandise location these signs provide customers with a comparison of product qualities clear pricing useful information regarding product benefits and suggestions for appropriate accessories our store layouts and visual displays afford our customers a feeling of familiarity and enhance the shopping experience also all of our store team members wear highly visible red vests aprons or smocks with nametags and our customer service and checkout counters are conveniently located 

merchandising and purchasing 

we offer an extensive assortment of products for those seeking to enjoy the out here  lifestyle as well as tradesmen and small businesses our broad product assortment and physical store size are tailored to meet the needs of our customers in various geographic markets our full line of product offerings includes a broad selection of high quality reputable brand name and exclusive brand products and is supported by a strong instock inventory position with an average of 16000  to 20000  products per store no one product accounted for more than 10  of our sales during 2015  we offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise 

 

the following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  



our buying team continuously reviews and updates our product assortment to respond to customer needs and to offer new relevant products we are focused on providing key products that our customers use on a regular basis for their lifestyle and maintenance needs with emphasis on consumable usable edible “cue” products examples of cue product categories include but are not limited to livestock feed and bedding pet food lubricants and various seasonal products such as heating pest control and twine 

our products are sourced through both domestic and international vendors our business is not dependent upon any one vendor or particular group of vendors we purchase our products from a group of approximately 800  vendors with no one vendor representing more than 10  of our purchases during fiscal 2015  approximately 300  core vendors accounted for 90  of our purchases during fiscal 2015  we have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative sources of supply for our products and we believe that adequate sources of supply exist at substantially similar costs for nearly all of our products we have no material longterm contractual commitments with any of our product vendors 

our buying teams focus on merchandise procurement vendor line reviews and testing of new products and programs we also employ a dedicated inventory management team that focuses exclusively on all forecasting and replenishment functions and a committed merchandise planning team that concentrates on assortment planning through the combined efforts of these teams we continue to focus on improving our overall inventory productivity and instock position 

intellectual property 

our subsidiary tractor supply co of texas lp “tsct” owns registrations with the united states patent and trademark office “uspto” for various service marks including tsc ®  tractor supply co ®  tsc tractor supply co ®  and the trapezium design for retail store services we consider these service marks and the accompanying goodwill and name recognition to be valuable assets of our business tsct also owns several other service marks for retail services some of which have been registered with the uspto and some of which are the subject of applications for registration pending before the uspto 

in addition to selling products that bear nationallyknown manufacturer brands we also sell products manufactured for us under a number of exclusive brands that we consider to be important to our business these exclusive brands are manufactured for us by a number of vendors and provide an alternative to the national brands which helps provide value for our customers and positions us as a destination store 

our exclusive brands represented approximately 31  of our total sales in fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  our exclusive brands include 



the exclusive brands identified above have been registered as trademarks with the uspto for certain products and are the subject of applications for registration pending before the uspto for other products 

our trademark and service mark registrations have various expiration dates however provided that we continue to use the marks and renew the registrations in a timely manner the registrations are potentially perpetual in duration 

we believe our intellectual property which includes the trademarks and service marks identified above together with certain trade names domain names patents and copyrights has significant value and is an important component of our merchandising and marketing strategies 

distribution 

we currently operate a distribution network for supplying stores with merchandise and in fiscal 2015  our stores received approximately 70  of merchandise through this network while the remaining merchandise shipped directly to the stores from our vendors we believe this flow facilitates the prompt and efficient distribution of merchandise to our stores in order to enhance instocks minimize freight costs and improve the inventory turn rate our distribution facilities located in arizona georgia indiana kentucky maryland nebraska texas and washington represent total distribution capacity of 50 million  square feet 

in 2015 we completed construction of a new distribution center in casa grande arizona with a capacity of approximately 650000 square feet this facility which began shipping merchandise to stores in december 2015 will support our western store expansion also in 2015 we completed construction of two smaller crossdock facilities “mixing centers” in texas to handle certain highvolume bulk products 

we continue to improve the technology in our distribution facilities and currently eight of our ten  facilities utilize a warehouse management system that provides for improved movement of inventory we will continue to refine this system and expect that it will be implemented in additional locations 

we select the locations of our distribution facilities in an effort to minimize logistics costs and optimize the distance from distribution facilities to our stores we manage our inbound and outbound transportation activity inhouse through the use of a webbased transportation management system we utilize several common carriers for store deliveries and manage our transportation costs through carrier negotiations the monitoring of transportation routes and the scheduling of deliveries 

marketing 

we utilize an “everyday value price” philosophy to consistently offer our products at competitive prices complemented by strategically planned promotions throughout the year to drive store traffic and position ourselves as a destination store we promote broad selections of merchandise with newspaper circulars customer targeted direct mail and email and digital offerings vendors frequently support these specific programs by offering temporary cost reductions and honoring coupons our vendors also provide assistance with product presentation and fixture design brochures support for instore events and pointofpurchase materials for customer education and product knowledge for our team members 

omnichannel 

we communicate with our customers across multiple touch points including our stores ecommerce website  tractorsupplycom  email and direct mail our goal is to be available when and how our customers choose to engage with our brand connecting with consumers online provides the opportunity to allow customers to shop at a time and place that fits their schedule while delivering enhanced product information research and decision tools that support product selection and informational needs in specific subject areas we give our customers the ability to purchase products and have them shipped to one of our retail stores their homes or offices we believe this capability further enhances customer service and extends our market to areas where our retail stores are not currently located we maintain a fulfillment center within our franklin kentucky distribution center to support our ecommerce activities additionally in 2015 we continued to invest in our omnichannel platform and expanded capabilities related to fulfillment options product information and site research we also introduced responsive web design that provided an enhanced mobile and tablet experience improved the site response time and added additional product offerings for vendor direct to customer shipments 

hometown pet 

we opened two hometown pet stores in fiscal 2014 hometown pet is a new pet supply store that provides highquality products knowledge and service to pet owners the stores offer products for a wide variety of pets and animals including cats dogs birds reptiles and fish as well as grooming and vet services we are a ‘testandlearn’ company and we believe these stores will help us gain better insight into the pet and animal supply category and provide valuable information that can help us better understand the unique needs of our pet customers 

management and team members 

as of december 26 2015  we employed approximately 12000  fulltime and 11000  parttime team members we also employ additional parttime team members during peak periods we are not party to any collective bargaining agreements 

at the end of fiscal 2015 our store operations were organized into nine regions each region is led by a regional director or vice president and the region is further organized into districts each of which is led by a district manager we have two internal advisory boards one comprised of store managers and the other comprised of district managers these groups bring a grassroots perspective to operational initiatives and generate chainwide endorsement of proposed bestpractice solutions 

all of our team members participate in one of various bonus incentive programs which provide the opportunity to receive additional compensation based upon team andor company performance in addition to bonus incentive programs we provide our eligible team members the opportunity to participate in an employee stock purchase plan and a 401k retirement savings plan we also share in the cost of health insurance provided to eligible team members and team members receive a discount on merchandise purchased at our stores 

we encourage a promotefromwithin environment when internal resources permit we also provide internal leadership development programs designed to prepare our highpotential team members for greater responsibility our current team of district managers and store managers have an average tenure of approximately six years management believes internal promotions coupled with the hiring of individuals with previous retail experience will provide the management structure necessary to support our planned growth 

continuous improvement 

we are committed to a continuous improvement program called tractor value system “tvs” which is our catalyst to drive change throughout our organization tvs is a business management system that emphasizes through data analytics and team member engagement a focus on continuous improvement through tvs we examine business processes and identify opportunities to reduce costs drive innovation and improve effectiveness we have implemented numerous continuous improvement projects with team members from multiple areas of our business to evaluate key operations and implement process changes team members are empowered and expected to challenge current paradigms and improve processes our management encourages the participation of all team members in decisionmaking regularly solicits input and suggestions from our team members and incorporates suggestions into our improvement activities 

management information and control systems 

we have invested considerable resources in our management information and control systems to support superior customer service manage the purchase and distribution of our merchandise improve our operating efficiencies and support online operations our key management information and control systems include a pointofsale system an ecommerce platform a supply chain management and replenishment system a warehouse management system a price optimization system a vendor purchase order control system and a merchandise presentation system these systems are integrated through an enterprise resource planning “erp” system this erp system tracks merchandise from initial order through ultimate sale and interfaces with our financial systems 

we continue to evaluate and improve the functionality of our systems to maximize their effectiveness such efforts include ongoing hardware and software evaluations refreshes and upgrades to support optimal software configurations and application performance we plan to continue to invest in information technology and implement efficiencydriving system enhancements we continue to strengthen the security of our information systems and invest in technology to support store distribution facility and omnichannel expansion these efforts are directed toward improving business processes maintaining secure efficient and stable systems and enabling the continued growth and success of our business 

growth strategy 

our current and longterm growth strategy is to 1 expand domestic geographic market presence through opening new retail stores 2 enhance financial performance through comparable store sales growth achieved through targeted merchandising and marketing programs with an “everyday value price” philosophy supported by strong customer service 3 enhance product margin through strategic product sourcing inventory and markdown management a strong exclusive brand offering and optimization of product pricing and transportation costs 4 leverage operating costs by focusing on opportunities for continuous improvement and elimination of waste in all of our processes 5 expand market opportunities via omnichannel enhancements tying together our website product content social media and online shopping experience and 6 expand through selective acquisitions as such opportunities arise to enhance penetration into new and existing markets to complement organic growth   

over the past five years we have experienced considerable sales growth resulting in a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 113  we plan to open approximately 115 to 120  new stores in 2016  a selling square footage increase of approximately 80  we opened 114  new stores in 2015  and 107  new stores in 2014  which represents selling square footage increases of approximately 80  during fiscal 2015  and 83  during fiscal 2014  

at december 26 2015  we operated 1488  retail stores in 49  states given the size of the communities that we target we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in many existing and new markets we have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 1000  additional markets for new tractor supply stores approximately 58  of our stores are in freestanding buildings and 42  are located in strip shopping centers we lease approximately 93  of our stores and own the remaining 7  

competition 

we operate in a competitive retail industry the principal competitive factors include location of stores price and quality of merchandise instock consistency merchandise assortment and presentation and customer service we compete with general 

merchandise retailers home center retailers specialty and discount retailers independently owned retail farm and ranch stores numerous privatelyheld regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives as well as internetbased retailers however we believe we successfully differentiate ourselves from many of these retailers by focusing on our specialized market niche for customers living the rural lifestyle see further discussion of competition in 1a “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10k 

seasonality and weather 

our business is seasonal historically our sales and profits are the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products we experience our highest inventory and accounts payable balances during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal products to support the higher sales volume of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter to support the higher sales volume of the coldweather selling season 

historically weather conditions including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and unseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months have affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations in addition extreme weather conditions including snow and ice storms flood and wind damage hurricanes tornadoes extreme rain and droughts have impacted operating results both negatively and positively depending on the severity and length of these conditions our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends 

stewardship and compliance with environmental matters 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment we are committed to complying with all applicable environmental laws and regulations we are also committed to becoming a more environmentally sustainable company this commitment is demonstrated through our stewardship program which is our environmental sustainability program through this program the company has implemented a number of initiatives designed to reduce our impact on the environment these initiatives include the installation of energy management systems high efficiency lighting and heatingair conditioning systems in our stores and recycling programs in our stores distribution facilities and the store support center our store support center opened in 2014 and our new distribution center in casa grande arizona opened in 2015 were each awarded leed leadership in energy and environmental design silver certification for environmentally sustainable design construction and operation we also installed solar arrays at the store support center in brentwood tennessee and our store in hendersonville tennessee

risk factors 

tableend 

our business faces many risks those risks of which we are currently aware and deem to be material are described below if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur our business financial condition or results of operations may significantly suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this form 10k 

general economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance 

our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending including discretionary spending a weakening of economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as lower employment levels uncertainty or changes in business or political conditions higher interest rates higher tax rates higher fuel and energy costs higher labor and healthcare costs the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to competitors a general reduction in the level of discretionary spending shifts in consumer discretionary spending to our competitors or shifts in discretionary spending to less profitable products sold by 

us could result in lower net sales slower inventory turnover greater markdowns on inventory and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins 

failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name 

our success depends in part on the value and strength of the tractor supply name the tractor supply name is integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business maintaining promoting and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide high quality merchandise and a consistent high quality customer experience our brand could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity failure to comply or accusation of failure to comply with ethical social product labor and environmental standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions any of these events could result in decreased revenue or otherwise adversely affect our business 

we may be unable to increase sales at our existing stores 

we experience fluctuations in our comparable store sales defined as sales in stores which have been open for at least twelve months various factors affect comparable store sales including the general retail sales environment our ability to efficiently source and distribute products changes in our merchandise assortment competition proximity of our locations to one another or to the locations of other retailers current economic conditions customer satisfaction with our products the timing of promotional events the release of new merchandise the success of marketing programs and weather conditions these factors may cause our comparable store sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations past comparable store sales are not necessarily an indication of future results and there can be no assurance that our comparable store sales will not decrease in the future 

purchase price volatility including inflationary and deflationary pressures may adversely affect our financial performance 

although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items grain corn steel petroleum cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services therefore we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost which may impact consumer demand and as a result sales and gross margin our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale from increased volume of purchases adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors while maintaining product quality should our strategy to mitigate purchase price volatility not be effective our financial performance could be adversely impacted 

weather conditions may have a significant impact on our financial results 

weather conditions affect the demand for and in some cases the supply of products which in turn has an impact on prices historically weather conditions including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and unseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months have affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations in addition extreme weather conditions including snow and ice storms flood and wind damage hurricanes tornadoes extreme rain and droughts have impacted operating results both negatively and positively depending on the severity and length of these conditions our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends should such a strategy not be effective the weather may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our merchandising initiatives and marketing emphasis may not provide expected results 

we believe our past performance has been based on and future success will depend upon in part the ability to develop and execute merchandising initiatives with effective marketing programs these merchandising initiatives and marketing programs may not deliver expected results and there is no assurance that we will correctly identify and respond in a timely manner to evolving trends and consumer preferences and expectations if we misjudge the market or our marketing programs are not successful we may overstock unpopular products and be forced to take inventory price reductions that have a material adverse influence on our profitability failure to execute and promote such initiatives in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow the business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition shortages of key merchandise could also have a material adverse impact on operating results and financial condition 

capital required for growth may not be available 

the construction or acquisition of new stores store support center facilities distribution facilities or other facilities the remodeling and renovation of existing facilities and investments in information technology require significant amounts of capital in the past our growth has been funded through internally generated cash flow and bank borrowings disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the ability of the banks to meet their commitments our access to funds under our credit facility 

as discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time in addition tight lending practices may make it difficult for our real estate developers to obtain financing under acceptable loan terms and conditions unfavorable lending practices could impact the timing of our store openings and materially adversely affect our ability to open new stores in desirable locations 

longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty changing or increased regulation reduced funding alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases cash dividends or other discretionary uses of cash 

failure to open and manage new stores in the number and manner currently contemplated could adversely affect our financial performance 

an integral part of our business strategy includes the expansion of our store base through new store openings this expansion strategy is dependent on our ability to find suitable locations and we face competition from many retailers for such sites if we are unable to implement this strategy our ability to increase our sales profitability and cash flow could be impaired significantly to the extent that we are unable to open new stores in the manner we anticipate due to among other reasons site approval or unforeseen delays in construction our sales growth may be impeded 

as we execute this expansion strategy we may also experience managerial or operational challenges which may prevent any expected increase in sales profitability or cash flow our ability to manage our planned expansion depends on the adequacy of our existing information systems the efficiency and expansion of our distribution systems the adequacy of the hiring and training process for new personnel especially store managers the effectiveness of our controls and procedures and the ability to identify customer demand and build market awareness in different geographic areas there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our planned expansion that the new stores will be effectively integrated into our existing operations or that such stores will be profitable 

although we have a rigorous real estate site selection and approval process there can be no assurance that our new store openings will be successful or result in incremental sales and profitability for the company new stores build their sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection over time and as a result generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales than our more mature stores as we continue to open new stores there may be a negative impact on our results from a lower contribution margin of these new stores until their sales levels ramp to chain average if at all as well as from the impact of related preopening costs 

we may pursue strategic acquisitions and the failure of an acquisition to produce the anticipated results or the inability to fully integrate the acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business 

we may from time to time acquire businesses we believe to be complementary to our business the success of an acquisition is based on our ability to make accurate assumptions regarding the valuation operations growth potential integration and other factors relating to the respective business acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and may result in the diversion of our capital and our management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities we may not be able to successfully integrate operations that we acquire including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures if we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions we could experience increased costs associated with operating inefficiencies which could have an adverse effect on our financial results also while we employ several different methodologies to assess potential business opportunities the new businesses may not meet our expectations and therefore adversely affect our financial performance 

competition may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations 

we operate in the highly competitive retail merchandise sector with numerous competitors these competitors include general merchandise retailers home center retailers other specialty retailers internet retailers independently owned farm and ranch stores regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives we compete for customers merchandise real estate locations and employees this competitive environment subjects us to various other risks including the inability to continue our store and sales growth and to provide attractive merchandise to our customers at competitive prices that allow us to maintain our profitability our failure to compete effectively in this environment could adversely impact our financial performance 

we face risks associated with vendors from whom our products are sourced 

the products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors we have agreements with our vendors in which the vendors agree to comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and to indemnify us against 

certain liabilities and costs our ability to recover liabilities and costs under these vendor agreements is dependent upon the financial condition and integrity of the vendors 

we rely on longterm relationships with our suppliers but have no longterm contracts with such suppliers our future success will depend in large measure upon our ability to maintain our existing supplier relationships or to develop new ones this reliance exposes us to the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various products due to political economic social or environmental conditions transportation delays or changes in laws and regulations affecting distribution our vendors may be forced to reduce their production shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection which could make it difficult for us to serve the market’s needs and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we rely on foreign manufacturers for various products that we sell in addition many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources as an importer our business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business internationally such as foreign governmental regulations economic disruptions delays in shipments transportation capacity and costs currency exchange rates and changes in political or economic conditions in countries from which we purchase products if any such factors were to render the conduct of business in particular countries undesirable or impractical or if additional united states quotas duties taxes or other charges or restrictions were imposed upon the importation of our products in the future our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we are subject to personal injury workers’ compensation product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business 

our business involves a risk of personal injury workers’ compensation product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business product liability claims from customers and product recalls for merchandise alleged to be defective or harmful could lead to the disposal or writeoff of merchandise inventories the incurrence of fines or penalties and damage to our reputation we maintain general liability and workers compensation insurance with a selfinsured retention for each policy type and a deductible for each occurrence we also maintain umbrella limits above the primary general liability and product liability coverage in many cases we have indemnification rights against the manufacturers of the products and their products liability insurance as well as the property owners of our leased buildings our ability to recover costs and damages under such insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject to the financial viability of the insurers manufacturers and landlords and the specific allegations of a claim no assurance can be given that our insurance coverage or the manufacturers’ or landlords’ indemnity will be available or sufficient in any claims brought against us 

our failure to attract and retain qualified team members could adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to continue expanding operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified team members our ability to meet labor needs while controlling wage and related labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force unemployment levels prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation if we are unable to locate attract or retain qualified personnel or if costs of labor or related costs increase significantly our financial performance could be adversely affected 

failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business and results 

the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting an internal control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all internal 

control systems internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements any failure to maintain an 

effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our business customers employees and vendors that we hold whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise could damage our reputation with customers employees and vendors could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation and could adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity 

we receive certain personal information about our customers employees and vendors we also rely on business partners to provide services to us that may include important business information or data about our customers employees and vendors in addition our online operations at tractorsupplycom  depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 

including information permitting cashless payments while we maintain substantial security measures to protect and to prevent unauthorized access to such information it is possible that unauthorized parties through cyberattacks which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated or by other means might compromise our security measures and obtain the personal information of customers employees and vendors that we hold or other confidential company data such an occurrence could adversely affect our reputation with our customers employees and vendors as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in significant legal and financial exposure beyond the scope or limits of insurance coverage moreover a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to respond to the breach and could result in a disruption of our operations 

in addition states and the federal government are increasingly enacting laws and regulations relating to data breaches and theft of employee and customer data these laws will likely increase the costs of doing business and if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these new laws we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies which could harm our business 

as customerfacing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our sales and marketing strategy the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences 

through our continued information technology enhancements we are able to provide an improved overall shopping environment and an omnichannel experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers tablets smart phones and other mobile communication devices we use our website both as a sales channel for our products and also as a method of providing product project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both instore and online sales omnichannel retailing is continually evolving and expanding and we must effectively respond to changing customer expectations and new developments disruptions failures or other performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and instore business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers 

if we are unable to maintain or upgrade our management information systems and software programs or if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient and our strategic business initiatives may not be successful 

we depend on management information systems for many aspects of our business we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that we can continue to support our business we could be materially adversely affected if we experienced a disruption or data loss relating to our management information systems and are unable to recover timely we could also be adversely impacted if we are unable to improve upgrade maintain and expand our management information systems particularly in light of the contemplated continued store growth 

the success of our strategic business initiatives designed to increase our sales and improve margin is dependent in varying degrees on the timely delivery and the functionality of information technology systems to support them extended delays or cost overruns in securing developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support the strategic business initiatives would delay and possibly even prevent us from realizing the projected benefits of those initiatives 

a significant disruption to our distribution network or to the timely receipt of inventory could adversely impact sales or increase our transportation costs which would decrease our profits 

we rely on our distribution and transportation network to provide goods to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner through deliveries to our distribution facilities from vendors and then from the distribution facilities or direct ship vendors to our stores by various means of transportation including shipments by sea air rail and truck any disruption unanticipated expense or operational failure related to this process could affect store operations negatively for example unexpected delivery delays including delays due to weather fuel shortages or other reasons or increases in transportation costs including increased fuel costs or a decrease in transportation capacity for overseas shipments could significantly decrease our ability to provide adequate product for sale 

resulting in lower sales and profitability in addition labor shortages or work stoppages in the transportation industry or longterm disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries could 

negatively affect our business also a fire tornado or other disaster at one of our distribution facilities could disrupt our timely receiving processing and shipment of merchandise to our stores which could adversely affect our business 

the implementation of our supply chain initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail 

we maintain a network of distribution facilities and have plans to build new facilities to support our growth objectives delays in opening distribution facilities could adversely affect our future operations by slowing store growth which may in turn reduce revenue growth in addition distributionrelated construction or expansion projects entail risks which could cause delays and cost overruns such as shortages of materials shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages unforeseen construction scheduling 

engineering environmental or geological problems weather interference fires or other casualty losses and unanticipated cost increases the completion date and ultimate cost of future projects could differ significantly from initial expectations due to constructionrelated or other reasons we cannot guarantee that all projects will be completed on time or within established budgets 

we continue to make significant technology investments in our supply chain these initiatives are designed to streamline our distribution process so that we can optimize the delivery of goods and services to our stores and distribution facilities in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives including those associated with managing thirdparty service providers and employing new webbased tools and services could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term in addition our improved supply chain technology might not provide the anticipated benefits it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the initiatives might fail altogether 

we cannot provide any guaranty of future dividend payments or that we will continue to repurchase our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program 

although our board of directors has indicated an intention to pay future quarterly cash dividends on our common stock any determination to pay or increase cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be based primarily upon our financial condition results of operations business requirements and our board of directors’ continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our stockholders and is in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the dividend furthermore although our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of 2 billion through december 2017 we may discontinue this program at any time 

the market price for our common stock might be volatile and could result in a decline in value 

the price at which our common stock trades may be volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to our operating results general trends and prospects for the retail industry announcements by our competitors analyst recommendations our ability to meet or exceed analysts’ or investors’ expectations the condition of the financial markets and other factors the company’s stock price is dependent in part on the multiple of earnings that investors are willing to pay that multiple is in part dependent on investors’ perception of the company’s future earnings growth prospects if investor perceptions of the company’s earnings growth prospects change the company’s earnings multiple may decline and its stock price could be adversely affected 

in addition the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies these fluctuations as well as general economic and market conditions may adversely affect the market price of our common stock notwithstanding our actual operating performance 

our costs of doing business could increase as a result of federal state local or foreign laws and regulations 

we are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and governmental regulations including those relating to environmental protection personal injury intellectual property consumer product safety building land use and zoning requirements workplace regulations wage and hour privacy and information security and employment law matters if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations or if these laws or regulations are violated by importers manufacturers or distributors we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

we are also subject to the foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” which prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business and the antibribery laws of other jurisdictions failure to comply with the fcpa and similar laws could subject us to among other things penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

effective tax rate changes and results of examinations by taxing authorities could materially impact our results 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the earnings mix being lower than historical results in states where we have lower statutory rates and higher than historical results in states where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the internal revenue service “irs” as well as state and local taxing authorities 

like many retailers a portion of our sales are to taxexempt customers the business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment these circumstances create risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance our results could be materially impacted by the determinations and expenses related to these and other proceedings by the irs and other state and local taxing authorities

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

the following discussion and analysis is intended to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results financial condition liquidity and capital resources during the threeyear period ended december 26 2015  our fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report this discussion contains forwardlooking statements see “forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” included elsewhere in this report 

overview 

tractor supply company is the largest operator of rural lifestyle retail stores in the united states the company is focused on supplying the needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and others who enjoy the rural lifestyle which we refer to as the “ out here ” lifestyle as well as tradesmen and small businesses as of december 26 2015  we operated 1488  retail stores in 49  states under the names tractor supply company   del’s feed  farm supply and hometown pet  we also operate a website under the name tractorsupplycom  our stores are located primarily in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities and they offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise 

 

our current and longterm growth strategy is to 1 expand domestic geographic market presence through opening new retail stores 2 enhance financial performance through comparable store sales growth achieved through targeted merchandising and marketing programs with an “everyday value price” philosophy supported by strong customer service 3 enhance product margin through strategic product sourcing inventory and markdown management a strong exclusive brand offering and optimization of product pricing and transportation costs 4 leverage operating costs by focusing on opportunities for continuous improvement and elimination of waste in all of our processes 5 expand market opportunities via omnichannel enhancements tying together our website product content social media and online shopping experience and 6 expand through selective acquisitions as such opportunities arise to enhance penetration into new and existing markets to complement organic growth 

over the past five years we have experienced considerable growth in stores growing from 1001 stores at the end of 2010  to 1488  stores at the end of fiscal 2015  and in sales with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 113  given the size of the communities that we target we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in existing and new markets we have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified approximately 1000  additional opportunities for new tractor supply stores 

executive summary 

we opened 114  new stores in 2015  and 107  new stores in 2014  a selling square footage increase of approximately 80  in fiscal 2015  and approximately 83  in fiscal 2014  during 2015  we opened stores in 33 states and completed construction of a new distribution center in casa grande arizona to support our continued expansion into the western states also in 2015 we completed construction of two smaller crossdock facilities “mixing centers” in texas to improve distribution of certain highvolume bulk products 

net sales increased   90  to 623 billion  in fiscal 2015  from 571 billion  in fiscal 2014  comparable store sales increased 31  in fiscal 2015  versus a 38  increase in fiscal 2014  gross profit increased   99  to 214 billion  in fiscal 2015  from 195 billion  in fiscal 2014  and gross margin increased   30  basis points to 344  of sales in fiscal 2015  from 341  of sales in fiscal 2014  operating income increased   10  basis points to 104  of net sales in fiscal 2015  from 103  of net sales in fiscal 2014  in fiscal 2015  diluted earnings per share grew 128  to 300  compared to 266  in fiscal 2014  

we ended the year with 638 million  in cash and outstanding debt of  1500  million after returning 3958 million  to our stockholders through stock repurchases and dividends 

significant accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our financial position andor results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 











quarterly financial data 

our unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2015  and 2014  are shown below in thousands except per share amounts 





a  comparable store metrics are calculated using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales excluding certain adjustments to net sales beginning in fiscal 2015 stores closed during the year are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations this change in the calculation methodology did not have a material impact on the comparable store metrics reported in prior periods presented due to the minimal number of stores closed in those periods stores relocated during the periods being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics if the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics becomes material we would remove relocated stores from the calculations 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales 



a  our gross margin amounts may not be comparable to those of other retailers since some retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of merchandise sold and others like our company exclude a portion of these distribution network costs from gross margin and instead include them in selling general and administrative “sga” expenses refer to note 1 – significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014   

net sales increased   90  to 623 billion  in fiscal 2015  from 571 billion  in fiscal 2014  comparable store sales for fiscal 2015  were 589 billion  a 31   increase  over fiscal 2014  this compares to a 38  comparable store sales increase in the prior year the comparable store transaction count increased   33  while comparable store average ticket decreased 02  for fiscal 2015  

comparable store metrics are calculated on an annual basis using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales excluding certain adjustments to net sales beginning in fiscal 2015 stores closed during the year are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations this change in the calculation methodology did not have a material impact on the comparable store metrics reported in prior periods due to the minimal number of stores closed in those periods stores relocated during the years being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics if the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics becomes material we would remove relocated stores from the calculations 

the comparable store sales increase was driven by an increase in traffic counts and the yearround strength of consumable usable edible cue products principally animal and petrelated merchandise hardline products such as fencing trailers and towing also performed well throughout the year the full year sales performance was negatively impacted by fourth quarter weakness in the key cold weather seasonal categories of heating stoves and fuel and insulated outerwear along with softness in seasonal big ticket items such as snow blowers log splitters and generators 

in addition to comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2015  sales from stores opened less than one year were 3510 million  in fiscal 2015  which represented 61  percentage points of the 90  increase over fiscal 2014  net sales sales from stores opened less than one year were 3534 million  in fiscal 2014  which represented 68  percentage points of the 106  increase over fiscal 2013  net sales 

the following chart summarizes our store growth during fiscal 2015  and 2014

gross profit increased   99  to 214 billion  in fiscal 2015  compared to 195 billion  in fiscal 2014  as a percent of sales gross margin increased   30  basis points to 344  for fiscal 2015  compared to 341  for fiscal 2014  this increase in gross margin principally reflects improved direct product margin direct product margin increased as a result of strong execution on our four strategic margin initiatives which include inventory and markdown management strategic sourcing exclusive branding and retail price management 

as a percent of sales sga expenses including depreciation and amortization increased   20  basis points to 240  in fiscal 2015  from 238  in fiscal 2014  this increase in sga as a percent of sales was mainly related to deleverage in rent and other occupancy 

costs at the stores and incremental costs associated with our two new mixing centers and our new distribution facility in casa grande arizona total sga expenses including depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2015   increased   97  to 149 billion  from 136 billion  in fiscal 2014  the increase in sga expenses primarily reflects new store growth and variable costs associated with our comparable store sales growth 

our effective tax rate decreased  to 366  for fiscal 2015  compared to 369  in fiscal 2014  predominantly as a result of the reversal of various reserves for uncertain tax positions

the comparable store sales increase was driven by continued strong results in key cue products principally animal and petrelated merchandise and an increase in traffic counts this was a result of continued investment in cue inventory expanded product assortments and improved localized product offerings seasonal merchandise predominantly heating and outdoor power equipment performed well during the year we also estimate that comparable store sales were unfavorably impacted by approximately 85 basis points due to deflation principally in livestock feed and bird feeding products 

in addition to comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2014 sales from stores opened less than one year were 3534 million in fiscal 2014 which represented 68 percentage points of the 106 increase over fiscal 2013 net sales sales from stores opened less than one year were 2812 million in fiscal 2013 which represented 60 percentage points of the 107 increase over fiscal 2012 net sales

sources and uses of cash 

our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and funds available under our credit facility as discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures while principal uses of cash for financing activities are repurchase of the company’s common stock and cash dividends paid to stockholders the following table presents a summary of cash flows provided by or used in operating investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years in millions 



operating activities 

operating activities provided net cash of 4292 million  4092 million  and 3337 million  in fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the 200 million   increase  in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  was primarily due to changes in the following operating activities in millions 



the 200 million   increase  in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015  compared with fiscal 2014  primarily reflects earnings growth and a favorable impact from the timing of deferred taxes partially offset by a net increase in inventories and accounts payable inventory increased due to store growth the carryover of coldweather merchandise additional investment in cue products and the timing of spring seasonal receipts while accounts payable grew at a lower rate due mainly to the timing of payments 

the 755 million  increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2014  over fiscal 2013  was primarily due to changes in the following operating activities in millions 



the 755 million  increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2014  compared with fiscal 2013  primarily reflects earnings growth the favorable impacts related to the timing of tax benefits and income tax payments and increased depreciation and amortization expense due to capital expenditures for store growth distribution facility capacity and corporate infrastructure 

investing activities 

investing activities used cash of 2359 million  1603 million  and 2093 million  in fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the changes in cash used for investing activities primarily reflects changes in capital expenditures capital expenditures for fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  were as follows in millions 



the above table reflects 114  new stores and six  relocations during fiscal 2015  107  new stores and two  relocations during fiscal 2014  and 102  new stores and three  relocations during fiscal 2013  the increase in spending on distribution center capacity and improvements in fiscal 2015 is primarily due to the construction of two mixing centers in texas which opened during the third quarter and our new southwest distribution center in casa grande arizona which began shipping merchandise to stores in the fourth quarter the increase in spending on information technology in fiscal 2015 represents continued improvements in data security and enhanced customer relationship management 

the majority of the corporate and other category for fiscal 2014  and 2013  relates to construction of our store support center in brentwood tennessee with the greatest portion of the spend in fiscal 2013 the higher capital expenditures for distribution facility capacity and improvements in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to construction of our macon georgia distribution center which was the relocation of our former leased southeast distribution center in braselton georgia we did not purchase any leased stores during fiscal 2015  or fiscal 2014 compared to having purchased three leased stores in fiscal 2013 

  

we currently estimate that capital expenditures will range between 230 million and 250 million in fiscal 2016  

 

financing activities 

financing activities used cash of 1806 million  3405 million and 1203 million in fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2015  was mainly the result of repurchases of common stock and quarterly cash dividends paid to stockholders partially offset by borrowings under the 2011 senior credit facility net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to sharebased compensation and excess tax benefits recognized on stock options exercised the decrease in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  is largely due to 150 million  of net borrowings under the 2011 senior credit facility 

the company’s board of directors has authorized common stock repurchases under the share repurchase program up to 2 billion  exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses related to such repurchases through december 2017  the repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions the timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors including price corporate and regulatory requirements capital availability and other market conditions repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance the program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice 

we repurchased approximately 34 million  47 million  and 23 million  shares of common stock under the share repurchase program at a total cost of 2927 million  2985 million  and 1294 million  in fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively as of december 26 2015  we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of 5707 million  exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses 

in the second quarter of fiscal 2015  we increased our quarterly dividend from 016 per share to 020 per share and in the second quarter of fiscal 2014  we increased our quarterly dividend from 013 per share to 016 per share we paid dividends totaling 1031 million  841 million  and 685 million  in fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

we believe that our existing cash balances expected cash flow from future operations funds available under our credit facility operating and capital leases and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs including new store openings store acquisitions relocations and renovations and distribution facility capacity through the end of fiscal 2016 

significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of december 26 2015  in thousands 



a capital lease obligations include related interest 

at december 26 2015  there were 487 million  outstanding letters of credit under the 2011 senior credit facility 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements are limited to operating leases and outstanding letters of credit the balances for these arrangements are previously discussed we typically lease buildings for retail stores rather than acquiring these assets through purchases letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory primarily sourced overseas in a timely manner and support certain risk management programs 

new accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” “asu 201409” asu 201409 amends the guidance for revenue recognition to replace numerous industryspecific requirements and converges areas under this topic with those of the international financial reporting standards the asu implements a fivestep process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards the amendment also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers other major provisions include the capitalization and amortization of certain contract costs ensuring the time value of money is considered in the transaction price and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances in august 2015 the fasb issued asu 201514 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 deferral of the effective date” which implemented a oneyear deferral of asu 201409 as a result of the deferral the amendments in asu 201409 are effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 entities can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of adoption management is currently assessing the impact the adoption of asu 201409 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures including which transition method it will adopt   

in april 2015 the fasb issued asu 201503 “interest  imputation of interest subtopic 83530 simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs” “asu 201503” this update requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability asu 201503 requires retrospective application and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2015 and interim periods within those fiscal years the company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures   

in july 2015 the fasb issued asu 201511 inventory topic 330 simplifying the measurement of inventory “asu 201511” this update requires an entity that determines the cost of inventory by methods other than lastin firstout and the retail inventory method to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value asu 201511 requires prospective application and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted the company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures   

in november 2015 the fasb issued asu 201517 “income taxes topic 740 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes” “asu 201517” this update requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet asu 201517 may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented the updated guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted upon adoption the updated guidance will affect the presentation of the deferred tax liabilities and assets within the company’s consolidated balance sheet however the updated guidance will not affect the accounting for deferred tax liabilities and assets other than the change in presentation the company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures   




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility as discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements which bears interest based on variable rates 

a 1 change in interest rates on our variable rate debt would have affected interest expense by approximately 11 million 07 million and 03 million in the fiscal years ended december 26 2015 december 27 2014 and december 28 2013 on a prospective basis a 1 change in interest rates on debt existing as of december 26 2015 would result in interest expense fluctuating approximately 15 million per year 

purchase price volatility 

although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items grain corn steel petroleum cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services therefore we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost which may impact consumer demand and as a result sales and gross margin our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale from increased volume of purchases adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality

we believe our intellectual property which includes the trademarks and service marks identified above together with certain trade names domain names and copyrights has significant value and is an important component of our merchandising and marketing strategies 

distribution 

we currently operate a distribution network for supplying stores with merchandise and in fiscal 2014  our stores received approximately 70  of merchandise through this network while the remaining merchandise shipped directly to the stores from our vendors we believe this flow facilitates the prompt and efficient distribution of merchandise to our stores in order to enhance instocks minimize freight costs and improve the inventory turn rate our seven  distribution centers located in georgia indiana kentucky maryland nebraska texas and washington represent total distribution capacity of 42 million  square feet in late 2014 we entered into a lease agreement for a second facility in hagerstown maryland with a capacity of 309000 square feet this additional space will support the future growth of stores in the northeast also in 2014 we started construction on a new 

distribution center in casa grande arizona with a capacity of approximately 650000 square feet this facility will support our western store expansion and is expected to begin operating in the fourth quarter of 2015 we continue to improve the technology in our distribution centers and currently four of our seven  facilities utilize a warehouse management system that provides for improved movement of inventory through increased use of conveyors and automation we will continue to refine this system and expect that it will be implemented in additional locations 

we select the locations of our distribution centers in an effort to minimize logistics costs and optimize the distance from distribution centers to our stores we manage our inbound and outbound transportation activity inhouse through the use of a webbased transportation management system we utilize several common carriers for store deliveries we manage our transportation costs through carrier negotiations the monitoring of transportation routes and the scheduling of deliveries 

marketing 

we utilize an “everyday value price” philosophy to consistently offer our products at competitive prices complemented by strategically planned promotions throughout the year to drive store traffic and position ourselves as a destination store we promote broad selections of merchandise with newspaper circulars customer targeted direct mail and email and internet offerings vendors frequently support these specific programs by offering temporary cost reductions and honoring coupons our vendors also provide assistance with product presentation and fixture design brochures support for instore events and pointofpurchase materials for customer education and product knowledge for our team members 

omnichannel 

we communicate with our customers across multiple touch points including our stores ecommerce website  tractorsupplycom  email and direct mail our goal is to be available when and how our customers choose to engage with our brand connecting with consumers online provides the opportunity to allow customers to shop at a time and place that fits their schedule while delivering enhanced product information research and decision tools that support product selection and informational needs in specific subject areas we give our customers the ability to purchase products and have them shipped to one of our retail stores their homes or offices we believe this capability further enhances customer service and extends our market to areas where our retail stores are not currently located we maintain a fulfillment center within our franklin kentucky distribution center to support our ecommerce activities additionally in 2014 we continued to invest in our omnichannel platform and expanded capabilities related to fulfillment options product information and site research we also introduced an optimized mobile and tablet experience improved the site response time and added additional product offerings for vendor direct to customer drop shipments 

hometown pet 

we opened two hometown pet stores in fiscal 2014 hometown pet is a new pet supply store that provides highquality products knowledge and service to pet owners the stores offer products for a wide variety of pets and animals including cats dogs poultry birds and horses as well as grooming and mobile vet services we are a ‘testandlearn’ company and we believe these stores will help us gain better insight into the pet and animal supply category and provide valuable information that can help us better understand the unique needs of our pet customers 

management and team members 

as of december 27 2014  we employed approximately 11000  fulltime and 10100  parttime team members we also employ additional parttime team members during peak periods we are not party to any collective bargaining agreements 

our store operations are organized into seven regions each region is led by a vice president of operations and the region is further organized into districts each of which is led by a district manager we have two internal advisory boards one comprised of store managers and the other comprised of district managers these groups bring a grassroots perspective to operational initiatives and generate chainwide endorsement of proposed bestpractice solutions 

all of our team members participate in one of various bonus incentive programs which provide the opportunity to receive additional compensation based upon team andor company performance in addition to bonus incentive programs we also provide our eligible team members the opportunity to participate in an employee stock purchase plan and a 401k retirement savings plan we also share in the cost of health insurance provided to our team members and team members receive a discount on merchandise purchased at our stores 

we encourage a promotefromwithin environment when internal resources permit we also provide internal leadership development programs designed to prepare our highpotential team members for greater responsibility our current team of district managers and store managers have an average tenure of approximately six years management believes internal promotions coupled with the hiring of individuals with previous retail experience will provide the management structure necessary to support our planned growth 

continuous improvement 

we are committed to a continuous improvement program called tractor value system “tvs” which is our catalyst to drive change throughout our organization tvs is a business management system that emphasizes through data analytics and team member engagement a focus on continuous improvement through tvs we examine business processes and identify opportunities to reduce costs drive innovation and improve effectiveness we have implemented numerous continuous improvement projects with team members from multiple areas of our business to evaluate key operations and implement process changes team members are empowered and expected to challenge current paradigms and improve processes our management encourages the participation of all team members in decisionmaking regularly solicits input and suggestions from our team members and incorporates suggestions into our improvement activities 

management information and control systems 

we have invested considerable resources in our management information and control systems to support superior customer service manage the purchase and distribution of our merchandise improve our operating efficiencies and support online operations our key management information and control systems include a pointofsale system an ecommerce platform a supply chain management and replenishment system a warehouse management system a price optimization system a vendor purchase order control system and a merchandise presentation system these systems are integrated through an enterprise resource planning “erp” system this erp system tracks merchandise from initial order through ultimate sale and interfaces with our financial systems 

we continue to evaluate and improve the functionality of our systems to maximize their effectiveness such efforts include ongoing hardware and software evaluations refreshes and upgrades to support optimal software configurations and application performance we plan to continue to upgrade our information technology and implement other efficiencydriving system enhancements we continue to strengthen the security of our information systems and invest in technology to support store distribution center and omnichannel expansion these efforts are directed toward improving business processes and achieving the most efficient and effective use of systems to manage our operations while ensuring a secure and reliable environment 

growth strategy 

our current and longterm growth strategy is to 1 expand domestic geographic market presence through opening new retail stores 2 enhance financial performance through comparable store sales growth achieved through targeted merchandising and marketing programs with an “everyday value price” philosophy supported by strong customer service 3 enhance product margin through strategic product sourcing inventory and markdown management a strong exclusive brand offering and optimization of product pricing and transportation costs 4 leverage operating costs by focusing on opportunities for continuous improvement and elimination of waste in all of our processes 5 expand market opportunities via ecommerce and internetsupported sales by improving our website product content and enhancing the online experience and 6 expand through selective acquisition as such opportunities arise to enhance penetration into new and existing markets to complement organic growth   

over the past five years we have experienced considerable sales growth resulting in a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 122  we plan to open 110  to 115  new stores in 2015  a selling square footage increase of approximately 8  we opened 107  new stores in 2014  and 102  new stores in 2013  which represents selling square footage increases of approximately 83  during both fiscal 2014  and 2013  

at december 27 2014  we operated 1382  retail stores in 49  states given the size of the communities that we target we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in many existing and new markets we have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 700  additional markets for new tractor supply stores approximately 56  of our stores are in freestanding buildings and 44  are located in strip shopping centers we lease approximately 93  of our stores and own the remaining 7  

competition 

we operate in a competitive retail industry the principal competitive factors include location of stores price and quality of merchandise instock consistency merchandise assortment and presentation and customer service we compete with general merchandise retailers home center retailers specialty and discount retailers independently owned retail farm and ranch stores numerous privatelyheld regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives as well as internetbased retailers however we believe we successfully differentiate ourselves from many of these retailers by focusing on our specialized market niche for customers living the rural lifestyle see further discussion of competition in 1a “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10k 

seasonality and weather 

our business is seasonal historically our sales and profits are the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products we experience our highest inventory and accounts payable balances during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal products to support the higher sales volume of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter to support the higher sales volume of the coldweather selling season 

historically weather conditions including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and unseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months have affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations in addition extreme weather conditions including snow and ice storms flood and wind damage hurricanes tornadoes extreme rain and droughts have impacted operating results both negatively and positively depending on the severity and length of these conditions our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends 

stewardship and compliance with environmental matters 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment we are committed to complying with all applicable environmental laws and regulations we are also committed to becoming a more environmentally sustainable company this commitment is demonstrated through our stewardship program which is our environmental sustainability program through this program the company has implemented a number of initiatives designed to reduce our impact on the environment these initiatives include the installation of energy management systems high efficiency lighting and heatingair conditioning systems in our stores and recycling programs in our stores distribution centers and the store support center in 2014 our new store support center was awarded leed leadership in energy and environmental design silver certification for its environmentally sustainable design construction and operation we also installed solar arrays at the new store support center in brentwood tennessee and our store in hendersonville tennessee

 item 1a  

risk factors 

tableend 

our business faces many risks those risks of which we are currently aware and deem to be material are described below if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur our business financial condition or results of operations may significantly suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this form 10k 

general economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance 

our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending including discretionary spending a weakening of economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as lower employment levels uncertainty or changes in business or political conditions higher interest rates higher tax rates higher fuel and energy costs higher labor and healthcare costs the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to competitors a general reduction in the level of discretionary spending shifts in consumer discretionary spending to our competitors or shifts in discretionary spending to less profitable products sold by us could result in lower net sales slower inventory turnover greater markdowns on inventory and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins 

purchase price volatility including inflationary and deflationary pressures may adversely affect our financial performance 

although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items grain corn steel petroleum cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services therefore we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost which may impact consumer demand and as a result sales and gross margin our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale from increased volume of purchases adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors while maintaining product quality should our strategy to mitigate purchase price volatility not be effective our financial performance could be adversely impacted 

we may be unable to increase sales at our existing stores 

we experience fluctuations in our comparable store sales defined as sales in stores which have been open for at least twelve months various factors affect comparable store sales including the general retail sales environment our ability to efficiently source and distribute products changes in our merchandise assortment competition current economic conditions customer satisfaction with our products the timing of promotional events the release of new merchandise the success of marketing programs and weather conditions these factors may cause our comparable store sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations past comparable store sales are not necessarily an indication of future results and there can be no assurance that our comparable store sales will not decrease in the future 

capital required for growth may not be available 

the construction or acquisition of new stores store support center facilities distribution facilities or other facilities the remodeling and renovation of existing stores and investments in information technology require significant amounts of capital in the past our growth has been funded through internally generated cash flow and bank borrowings disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the ability of the banks to meet their commitments our access to funds under our senior credit facility which provides for borrowings of up to 400 million  is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time in addition tight lending practices may make it challenging for our real estate developers to obtain financing under acceptable loan terms and conditions unfavorable lending practices could impact the timing of our store openings and materially adversely affect our ability to open new stores in desirable locations 

longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty changing or increased regulation reduced funding alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases cash dividends or other discretionary uses of cash 

failure to open and manage new stores in the number and manner currently contemplated could adversely affect our financial performance 

an integral part of our business strategy includes the expansion of our store base through new store openings this expansion strategy is dependent on our ability to find suitable locations and we face competition from many retailers for such sites if we are unable to implement this strategy our ability to increase our sales profitability and cash flow could be impaired significantly to the extent that we are unable to open new stores in the manner we anticipate due to among other reasons site approval or unforeseen delays in construction our sales growth may be impeded 

as we execute this expansion strategy we may also experience managerial or operational challenges which may prevent any expected increase in sales profitability or cash flow our ability to manage our planned expansion depends on the adequacy of our existing information systems the efficiency and expansion of our distribution systems the adequacy of the hiring and training process for new personnel especially store managers the effectiveness of our controls and procedures and the ability to identify customer demand in different geographic areas there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our planned expansion that the new stores will be effectively integrated into our existing operations or that such stores will be profitable 

although we have a rigorous real estate site selection and approval process there can be no assurance that our new store openings will be successful or result in incremental sales and profitability for the company new stores build their sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection over time and as a result generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales than our more mature stores as we continue to open new stores there may be a negative impact on our results 

from a lower contribution margin of these new stores until their sales levels ramp to chain average if at all as well as from the impact of related preopening costs 

we may pursue strategic acquisitions and the failure of an acquisition to produce the anticipated results or the inability to fully integrate the acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business 

we may from time to time acquire businesses we believe to be complementary to our business the success of an acquisition is based on our ability to make accurate assumptions regarding the valuation operations growth potential integration and other factors relating to the respective business acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and may result in the diversion of our capital and our management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities we may not be able to successfully integrate operations that we acquire including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures if we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions we could experience increased costs associated with operating inefficiencies which could have an adverse effect on our financial results also while we employ several different methodologies to assess potential business opportunities the new businesses may not meet or exceed our expectations and therefore adversely affect our financial performance 

competition may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations 

we operate in the highly competitive retail merchandise sector with numerous competitors these competitors include general merchandise retailers home center retailers other specialty retailers internet retailers independently owned farm and ranch stores regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives we compete for customers merchandise real estate locations and employees this competitive environment subjects us to various other risks including the inability to continue our store and sales growth and to provide attractive merchandise to our customers at competitive prices that allow us to maintain our profitability our failure to compete effectively in this environment could adversely impact our financial performance 

weather conditions may have a significant impact on our financial results 

weather conditions affect the demand for and in some cases the supply of products which in turn has an impact on prices historically weather conditions including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and unseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months have affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations in addition extreme weather conditions including snow and ice storms flood and wind damage hurricanes tornadoes extreme rain and droughts have impacted operating results both negatively and positively depending on the severity and length of these conditions our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends should such a strategy not be effective the weather may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our merchandising initiatives and marketing emphasis may not provide expected results 

we believe our past performance has been based on and future success will depend upon in part the ability to develop and execute merchandising initiatives with effective marketing programs these merchandising initiatives and marketing programs may not deliver expected results and there is no assurance that we will correctly identify and respond in a timely manner to evolving trends and consumer preferences and expectations if we misjudge the market or our marketing programs are not successful we may overstock unpopular products and be forced to take inventory price reductions that have a material adverse influence on our profitability failure to execute and promote such initiatives in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow the business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition shortages of key merchandise could also have a material adverse impact on operating results and financial condition 

we face risks associated with vendors from whom our products are sourced 

the products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors we have agreements with our vendors in which the vendors agree to comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and to indemnify us against certain liabilities and costs our ability to recover liabilities and costs under these vendor agreements is dependent upon the financial condition and integrity of the vendors 

we rely on longterm relationships with our suppliers but have no longterm contracts with such suppliers our future success will depend in large measure upon our ability to maintain our existing supplier relationships or to develop new ones this reliance exposes us to the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various products due to political economic social or environmental conditions transportation delays or changes in laws and regulations affecting distribution our vendors may be forced to reduce their production shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection which could make it difficult for us to serve the market’s needs and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we rely on foreign manufacturers for various products that we sell in addition many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources as an importer our business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business 

internationally such as foreign governmental regulations economic disruptions delays in shipments transportation capacity and costs currency exchange rates and changes in political or economic conditions in countries from which we purchase products if any such factors were to render the conduct of business in particular countries undesirable or impractical or if additional united states quotas duties taxes or other charges or restrictions were imposed upon the importation of our products in the future our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our failure to attract and retain qualified team members could adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to continue expanding operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified team members our ability to meet labor needs while controlling wage and related labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force unemployment levels prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation if we are unable to locate attract or retain qualified personnel or if costs of labor or related costs increase significantly our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we are subject to personal injury workers’ compensation product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business 

our business involves a risk of personal injury workers’ compensation product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business product liability claims from customers and product recalls for merchandise alleged to be defective or harmful could lead to the disposal or writeoff of merchandise inventories the incurrence of fines or penalties and damage to our reputation we maintain general liability and workers compensation insurance with a selfinsured retention for each policy type and a deductible for each occurrence we also maintain umbrella limits above the primary general liability and product liability coverage in many cases we have indemnification rights against the manufacturers of the products and their products liability insurance as well as the property owners of our leased buildings our ability to recover costs and damages under such insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject to the financial viability of the insurers manufacturers and landlords and the specific allegations of a claim no assurance can be given that our insurance coverage or the manufacturers’ or landlords’ indemnity will be available or sufficient in any claims brought against us 

our costs of doing business could increase as a result of federal state local or foreign laws and regulations 

we are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and governmental regulations relating to environmental protection personal injury intellectual property consumer product safety building land use and zoning requirements workplace regulations wage and hour privacy and information security and employment law matters if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations or if these laws or regulations are violated by importers manufacturers or distributers we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

we are also subject to the foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” which prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business and the antibribery laws of other jurisdictions failure to comply with the fcpa and similar laws could subject us to among other things penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our business customers employees and vendors that we hold whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise could damage our reputation with customers employees and vendors could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation and could adversely affect our operating results financial condition and liquidity 

we receive certain personal information about our customers employees and vendors we also rely on business partners to provide services to us that may include important business information or data about our customers employees and vendors in addition our online operations at tractorsupplycom  depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments while we maintain substantial security measures to protect and to prevent unauthorized access to such information it is possible that unauthorized parties through cyberattacks which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated or by other means might compromise our security measures and obtain the personal information of customers employees and vendors that we hold or other confidential company data such an occurrence could adversely affect our reputation with our customers employees and vendors as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in significant legal and financial exposure beyond the scope or limits of insurance coverage moreover a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to respond to the breach and could result in a disruption of our operations 

in addition states and the federal government are increasingly enacting laws and regulations relating to data breaches and theft of employee and customer data these laws will likely increase the costs of doing business and if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these new laws we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies which could harm our business 

as customerfacing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our sales and marketing strategy the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences 

through our continued information technology enhancements we are able to provide an improved overall shopping environment and an omnichannel experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers tablets smart phones and other mobile communication devices we use our website both as a sales channel for our products and also as a method of providing product project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both instore and online sales omnichannel retailing is continually evolving and expanding and we must effectively respond to changing customer expectations and new developments disruptions failures or other performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and instore business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers 

a significant disruption to our distribution network or to the timely receipt of inventory could adversely impact sales or increase our transportation costs which would decrease our profits 

we rely on our distribution and transportation network to provide goods to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner through deliveries to our distribution centers from vendors and then from the distribution centers or direct ship vendors to our stores by various means of transportation including shipments by sea air rail and truck any disruption unanticipated expense or operational failure related to this process could affect store operations negatively for example unexpected delivery delays including delays due to weather fuel shortages or other reasons or increases in transportation costs including increased fuel costs or a decrease in transportation capacity for overseas shipments could significantly decrease our ability to provide adequate product for sale resulting in lower sales and profitability in addition labor shortages or work stoppages in the transportation industry or longterm disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries could negatively affect our business also a fire tornado or other disaster at one of our distribution centers could disrupt our timely receiving processing and shipment of merchandise to our stores which could adversely affect our business 

the implementation of our supply chain initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail 

we maintain a network of distribution facilities and have plans to build new facilities to support our growth objectives delays in opening distribution centers could adversely affect our future operations by slowing store growth which may in turn reduce revenue growth in addition distributionrelated construction or expansion projects entail risks which could cause delays and cost overruns such as shortages of materials shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages unforeseen construction scheduling engineering environmental or geological problems weather interference fires or other casualty losses and unanticipated cost increases the completion date and ultimate cost of future projects could differ significantly from initial expectations due to constructionrelated or other reasons we cannot guarantee that all projects will be completed on time or within established budgets 

we continue to make significant technology investments in our supply chain these initiatives are designed to streamline our distribution process so that we can optimize the delivery of goods and services to our stores and distribution centers in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives including those associated with managing thirdparty service providers and employing new webbased tools and services could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term in addition our improved supply chain technology might not provide the anticipated benefits it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the initiatives might fail altogether 

if we are unable to maintain or upgrade our management information systems and software programs or if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient and our strategic business initiatives may not be successful 

we depend on management information systems for many aspects of our business we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that we can continue to support our business we could be materially adversely affected if our management information systems are disrupted or if we are unable to improve upgrade maintain and expand systems particularly in light of the contemplated continued store growth 

the success of our strategic business initiatives designed to increase our sales and improve margin is dependent in varying degrees on the timely delivery and the functionality of information technology systems to support them extended delays or cost overruns 

in securing developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support the strategic business initiatives would delay and possibly even prevent us from realizing the projected benefits of those initiatives 

we cannot provide any guaranty of future dividend payments or that we will continue to repurchase our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program 

although our board of directors has indicated an intention to pay future quarterly cash dividends on our common stock any determination to pay or increase cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be based primarily upon our financial condition results of operations business requirements and our board of directors’ continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our stockholders and is in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the dividend furthermore although our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of 2 billion through december 2017 we may discontinue this program at any time 

the market price for our common stock might be volatile and could result in a decline in value 

the price at which our common stock trades may be volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to our operating results general trends and prospects for the retail industry announcements by our competitors analyst recommendations our ability to meet or exceed analysts’ or investors’ expectations the condition of the financial markets and other factors the company’s stock price is dependent in part on the multiple of earnings that investors are willing to pay that multiple is in part dependent on investors’ perception of the company’s future earnings growth prospects if investor perceptions of the company’s earnings growth prospects change the company’s earnings multiple may decline and its stock price could be adversely affected 

in addition the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies these fluctuations as well as general economic and market conditions may adversely affect the market price of our common stock notwithstanding our actual operating performance 

effective tax rate changes and results of examinations by taxing authorities could materially impact our results 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the earnings mix being lower than historical results in states where we have lower statutory rates and higher than historical results in states where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the internal revenue service “irs” as well as state and local taxing authorities like many retailers a portion of our sales are to taxexempt customers the business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment these circumstances create risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance our results could be materially impacted by the determinations and expenses related to these and other proceedings by the irs and other state and local taxing authorities 

failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business and results 

the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting an internal control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name 

our success depends in part on the value and strength of the tractor supply name the tractor supply name is integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business maintaining promoting and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide high quality merchandise and a consistent high quality customer experience our brand could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity failure to comply or accusation of failure to comply with ethical social product labor and environmental standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions any of these events could result in decreased revenue or otherwise adversely affect our business

overview 

tractor supply company is the largest operator of rural lifestyle retail stores in the united states the company is focused on supplying the needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and others who enjoy the rural lifestyle as well as tradesmen and small businesses as of december 27 2014  we operated 1382  retail stores in 49  states under the names tractor supply company   del’s feed  farm supply and hometown pet  we also operate a website under the name tractorsupplycom  our stores are located primarily in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities and they offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise 

 

our current and longterm growth strategy is to 1 expand domestic geographic market presence through opening new retail stores 2 enhance financial performance through comparable store sales growth achieved through targeted merchandising and marketing programs with an “everyday value price” philosophy supported by strong customer service 3 enhance product margin through strategic product sourcing inventory and markdown management a strong exclusive brand offering and optimization of product pricing and transportation costs 4 leverage operating costs by focusing on opportunities for continuous improvement and elimination of waste in all of our processes 5 expand market opportunities via ecommerce and internetsupported sales by improving our website product content and enhancing the online experience and 6 expand through selective acquisition as such opportunities arise to enhance penetration into new and existing markets to complement organic growth 

over the past five years we have experienced considerable growth in stores growing from 930 stores at the end of 2009  to 1382  stores at the end of fiscal 2014  and in sales with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 122  given the size of the communities that we target we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in existing and new markets we have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 700  additional markets for new tractor supply stores 

executive summary 

we opened 107  new stores in 2014  and 102  new stores in 2013  a selling square footage increase of approximately 83  in both fiscal 2014  and 2013  during 2014  we opened stores in 31 states including our first store in utah and in 2015  we expect to continue our expansion into the western states 

net sales increased   106  to 571 billion  in fiscal 2014  from 516 billion  in fiscal 2013  comparable store sales increased 38  in fiscal 2014  versus a 48  increase in fiscal 2013  gross profit increased   112  to 195 billion  in fiscal 2014  from 175 billion  in fiscal 2013  and gross margin increased   10  basis points to 341  of sales in fiscal 2014  from 340  of sales in fiscal 2013  operating profit increased   30  basis points to 103  of sales in fiscal 2014  from 100  of sales in fiscal 2013  in fiscal 2014  diluted earnings per share grew 147  to 266  compared to 232  in fiscal 2013  

we ended the year with 511 million  in cash after returning 3826 million  to our stockholders through stock repurchases and dividends 

significant accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our financial position andor results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 











quarterly financial data 

our unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2014  and 2013  are shown below in thousands except per share amounts 





a due to the nature of interim net income per share calculations the sum of quarterly net income per share amounts may not equal the reported net income per share for the year 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales 



a  our gross margin amounts may not be comparable to those of other retailers since some retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of merchandise sold and others like our company exclude a portion of these distribution network costs from gross margin and instead include them in selling general and administrative “sga” expenses refer to note 1 – significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013   

net sales increased   106  to 571 billion  in fiscal 2014  from 516 billion  in fiscal 2013  comparable store sales for fiscal 2014  were 537 billion  a 38   increase  over fiscal 2013  this compares to a 48  comparable store sales increase in the prior year the comparable store transaction count increased   32  while comparable store average ticket increased 06  for fiscal 2014  

comparable store sales are calculated on an annual basis using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales and exclude certain adjustments to net sales stores closed or relocated during either of the years being compared are not removed from our comparable store sales metrics calculations if the effect of closed andor relocated stores on our comparable store sales metrics calculations becomes material we would remove closed andor relocated stores from the calculations 

the comparable store sales increase was driven by continued strong results in key consumable usable edible “cue” products principally animal and petrelated merchandise and an increase in traffic counts this was a result of continued investment in cue inventory expanded product assortments and improved localized product offerings seasonal merchandise predominantly heating and outdoor power equipment performed well during the year we also estimate that comparable store sales were unfavorably impacted by approximately 85 basis points due to deflation principally in livestock feed and bird feeding products 

in addition to comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2014  sales from stores opened less than one year were 3534 million  in fiscal 2014  which represented 68  percentage points of the 106  increase over fiscal 2013  net sales sales from stores opened less than one year were 2812 million  in fiscal 2013  which represented 60  percentage points of the 107  increase over fiscal 2012  net sales

gross profit increased   112  to 195 billion  in fiscal 2014  compared to 175 billion  in fiscal 2013  as a percent of sales gross margin increased   10  basis points to 341  for fiscal 2014  compared to 340  for fiscal 2013  this improvement in gross margin reflects improved direct product margin partially offset by higher transportation costs primarily due to our continued western store expansion direct product margin increased as a result of continued focus on our four strategic margin initiatives which include inventory and markdown management strategic sourcing exclusive branding and retail price management 

as a percent of sales sga expenses including depreciation and amortization improved   20  basis points to 238  in fiscal 2014  from 240  in fiscal 2013  the sga improvement as a percent of sales was primarily attributable to the leverage of comparable store sales growth and lower yearoveryear incentive compensation expense total sga expenses including depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2014   increased   98  to 136 billion  from 124 billion  in fiscal 2013  the increase in sga primarily reflects new store growth and variable costs associated with our comparable store sales growth 

our effective tax rate increased  to 369  for fiscal 2014  compared to 362  in fiscal 2013  as the prior year was favorably impacted by the reversal of various reserves for uncertain tax positions 

as a result of the foregoing factors net income for fiscal 2014   increased   130  to 3709 million  or 266  per diluted share as compared to net income of 3282 million  or 232  per diluted share in fiscal 2013  

during fiscal 2014  we repurchased approximately 47 million  shares of the company’s common stock at a total cost of 2985 million  as part of our previously announced 2 billion  share repurchase program in fiscal 2013  we repurchased approximately 23 million  shares at a total cost of 1294 million  

fiscal 2013  compared to fiscal 2012   

net sales increased 107 to 516 billion in fiscal 2013 from 466 billion in fiscal 2012 comparable store sales for fiscal 2013 were 489 billion a 48 increase over fiscal 2012 this compares to a 53 comparable store sales increase in the prior year the comparable store transaction count increased 47 while comparable store average ticket remained flat for fiscal 2013 principally as a result of big ticket sales being less of the sales mix 

the comparable store sales increase was driven by continued strong results in key cue products principally animal and petrelated merchandise this was a result of continued investment in cue inventory expanded product assortments and improved localized product offerings winter seasonal merchandise predominantly heating and insulated outerwear also performed well during the first part of fiscal 2013 and the end of fiscal 2013 due to the colder than average weather we also estimate that comparable store sales were favorably impacted by approximately 70 basis points due to inflation principally in pet food and livestock feed 

in addition to comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2013 sales from stores opened less than one year were 2812 million in fiscal 2013 which represented 60 percentage points of the 107 increase over fiscal 2012 net sales sales from stores opened less than one year were 2762 million in fiscal 2012 which represented 65 percentage points of the 102 increase over fiscal 2011 net sales 

the following chart summarizes our store growth during fiscal 2013  and 2012  



the following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2013  and 2012  



gross profit increased 120 to 175 billion in fiscal 2013 compared to 157 billion in fiscal 2012 as a percent of sales gross margin increased 40 basis points to 340 for fiscal 2013 compared to 336 for fiscal 2012 this improvement in gross margin reflects improved direct product margin direct product margin increased as a result of continued progress on our four strategic margin initiatives which include inventory and markdown management strategic sourcing exclusive branding and retail price management 

as a percent of sales sga expenses including depreciation and amortization improved 20 basis points to 240 in fiscal 2013 from 242 in fiscal 2012 the sga improvement as a percent of sales was primarily attributable to the leverage of continued solid comparable store sales growth expense control related to store operating costs and lower yearoveryear incentive compensation expense partially offset by costs related to the new and expanded southeast distribution center and relocation of our corporate data center total sga expenses for fiscal 2013 increased 97 to 124 billion from 113 billion in fiscal 2012 the increase in sga primarily reflects new store growth and variable costs associated with our comparable store sales growth as well as operating costs relating to our new and expanded southeast distribution center and corporate data center 

our effective tax rate decreased to 362 for fiscal 2013 compared to 366 in fiscal 2012 the reduction in the tax rate resulted primarily from the favorable impact of the reversal of various reserves for uncertain tax positions 

as a result of the foregoing factors net income for fiscal 2013 increased 187 to 3282 million or 232 per diluted share as compared to net income of 2765 million or 190 per diluted share in fiscal 2012 

during fiscal 2013 we repurchased approximately 23 million shares of the company’s common stock at a total cost of 1294 million as part of our previously announced 2 billion share repurchase program in fiscal 2012 we repurchased approximately 61 million shares at a total cost of 2718 million 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

in addition to normal operating expenses our primary ongoing cash requirements are for new store expansion remodeling and relocation programs distribution center and store support center capacity and improvements information technology inventory purchases share repurchases and cash dividends our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are existing cash balances funds provided from operations borrowings available under our senior credit facility capital and operating leases and normal trade credit our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters to support the higher sales volume of the spring and coldweather selling seasons respectively 

working capital 

at december 27 2014  the company had working capital of 6709 million  which decreased   62 million  from december 28 2013  the shifts in working capital were attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities in millions 



in comparison to december 28 2013  working capital as of december 27 2014  was impacted most significantly by changes in our cash inventory and accounts payable 

 

borrowings and credit facilities 

on may 16 2014 the company exercised the option to increase the availability under the senior credit facility by 150 million which increased the aggregate principle amount available thereunder from 250 million to 400 million  the sublimit for swingline loans was also increased from 20 million to 30 million  this agreement is unsecured and matures in october 2016  with proceeds available to be used for working capital capital expenditures dividends share repurchases and other matters 

at december 27 2014  and december 28 2013  there were no  outstanding borrowings under the senior credit facility there were 407 million  and 382 million  outstanding letters of credit under the senior credit facility as of december 27 2014  and december 28 2013  respectively borrowings bear interest at either the bank’s base rate  325  at december 27 2014  or the london interbank offer rate “libor”  017  at december 27 2014  plus an additional amount ranging from 040  to 100  per annum  050  at december 27 2014  adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio we are also required to pay quarterly in arrears a commitment fee for unused capacity ranging from 008  to 020  per annum  010  at december 27 2014  adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio there are no compensating balance requirements associated with the senior credit facility 

the senior credit facility requires quarterly compliance with respect to two material covenants a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio the fixed charge coverage ratio compares earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization stock compensation and rent expense “consolidated ebitdar” to the sum of interest paid and rental expense excluding any straightline rent adjustments the leverage ratio compares total debt plus rental expense excluding any straightline rent adjustments multiplied by a factor of six to consolidated ebitdar the senior credit facility also contains certain other restrictions regarding additional indebtedness capital expenditures business operations guarantees investments mergers consolidations and sales of assets transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates and liens we were in compliance with all covenants at december 27 2014  

sources and uses of cash 

our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures while uses of cash for financing activities are repurchase of the company’s common stock and cash dividends paid to stockholders the following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years in millions 



operating activities 

operating activities provided net cash of 4092 million  3337 million  and 3783 million  in fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the 755 million   increase  in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  was primarily due to changes in the following operating activities in millions 



the 755 million   increase  in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2014  compared with fiscal 2013  primarily reflects earnings growth the favorable impacts related to the timing of tax benefits and income tax payments and increased depreciation and amortization expense due to capital expenditures for store growth distribution center capacity and corporate infrastructure 

the 446 million  decrease in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2013  over fiscal 2012  was primarily due to changes in the following operating activities in millions 



the 446 million  decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2013  compared with fiscal 2012  primarily related to increased inventory levels a reduction in accounts payable and timing of estimated tax payments partially offset by an increase in net earnings inventory increased in proportion to store growth as expected but the accounts payable balance declined year over year the timing of receipt of seasonal goods was much earlier in the fourth quarter in 2013 compared to 2012 and imports made up a larger percentage of fourth quarter receipts requiring payment on trade credit prior to year end these factors drove the decline in accounts payable income taxes payable declined due to the timing of estimated tax payments resulting from changes in allowable deductions for depreciation expense 

investing activities 

investing activities used cash of 1603 million  2093 million  and 1391 million  in fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the changes in cash used for investing activities primarily reflects changes in capital expenditures capital expenditures for fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  were as follows in millions 



the above table reflects 107  new stores and two  relocations during fiscal 2014  102  new stores and three  relocations during fiscal 2013  and 93  new stores and one  relocation during fiscal 2012  the majority of the corporate and other category for fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  relates to construction of our new store support center in brentwood tennessee with the greatest portion of the spend in fiscal 2013  the higher capital expenditures in fiscal 2013  for distribution center capacity and improvements was primarily due to construction of our macon georgia distribution center which was the relocation of our former leased southeast distribution center in braselton georgia we did not purchase any leased stores during fiscal 2014  compared to having purchased three leased stores in fiscal 2013  and five leased stores in fiscal 2012  

  

we currently estimate that capital expenditures will range between 240 million and 250 million in fiscal 2015  

 

financing activities 

financing activities used cash of 3405 million  1203 million and 2775 million in fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2014  was mainly the result of repurchases of common stock and quarterly cash dividends paid to stockholders partially offset by net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to sharebased compensation and excess tax benefits recognized on stock options exercised the increase in net cash used in financing activities is largely due to an increase of 1691 million  in common stock repurchases made in fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  

on february 24 2014 the company’s board of directors authorized a 1 billion  increase to the existing share repurchase program bringing the total amount authorized to date under the program to an aggregate of 2 billion  of common stock exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses related to such repurchases through december 2017  the repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions the timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors including price corporate and regulatory requirements capital availability and other market conditions repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance the program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice 

we repurchased approximately 47 million  23 million  and 61 million  shares of common stock under the share repurchase program at a total cost of 2985 million  1294 million  and 2718 million  in fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively as of december 27 2014  we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of 8633 million  exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses 

in the second quarter of fiscal 2014  we increased our quarterly dividend from 013 per share to 016 per share and in the second quarter of fiscal 2013  we increased our quarterly dividend from 010 per share to 013 per share we paid dividends totaling 841 million  685 million  and 513 million  in fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

we believe that our existing cash balances expected cash flow from future operations borrowings available under the senior credit facility operating and capital leases and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs including new store openings store acquisitions relocations and renovations and distribution center capacity through the end of fiscal 2015 

significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of december 27 2014  in thousands

at december 27 2014  there were 407 million  outstanding letters of credit under the senior credit facility and an 183 million  outstanding letter of credit at a financial institution outside of the senior credit facility 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements are limited to operating leases and outstanding letters of credit the balances for these arrangements are previously discussed we typically lease buildings for retail stores rather than acquiring these assets through purchases letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory primarily sourced overseas in a timely manner and support certain risk management programs

purchase price volatility 

although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items grain corn steel petroleum cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services therefore we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost which may impact consumer demand and as a result sales and gross margin our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale from increased volume of purchases adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality

business strategy 

we believe our sales and earnings growth are the result of executing our business strategy which includes the following key components 

  

market niche 

we have identified a specialized market niche supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and others who enjoy the rural lifestyle as well as tradesmen and small businesses by focusing our product assortment on these core customers we believe we are differentiated from general merchandise home center and other specialty retailers we cater to the rural lifestyle and often serve a market by being a trip consolidator for many basic maintenance needs for farm ranch and rural customers 

customers

merchandising and purchasing 

we offer an extensive assortment of products for those seeking to enjoy the out here  lifestyle our broad product assortment and physical store size are tailored to meet the needs of our customers in various geographic markets our full line of product offerings is supported by a strong instock inventory position with an average of 16000  to 19500  products per store no one product accounted for more than 10  of our sales during 2013  we offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise 

 

the following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  



our buying team constantly reviews and updates our product assortment to respond to customer needs and to offer new relevant products we are focused on providing key products that our customers use on a regular basis for their lifestyle and maintenance needs with emphasis on consumable usable edible cue products examples of cue product categories include but are not limited to livestock feed and bedding pet food lubricants and various seasonal products such as pest control and twine 

our products are sourced through both domestic and international vendors our business is not dependent upon any one vendor or particular group of vendors we purchase our products from a group of approximately 800  vendors with no one vendor representing more than 10  of our purchases during fiscal 2013  approximately 300  core vendors accounted for 90  of our purchases during fiscal 2013  we have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative sources of supply for our products and we believe that adequate sources of supply exist at substantially similar costs for nearly all of our products we have no material longterm contractual commitments with any of our vendors 

our buying team focuses on merchandise procurement vendor line reviews and testing of new products and programs we also employ a dedicated inventory management team that focuses exclusively on all forecasting and replenishment functions and a committed merchandise planning team that concentrates on assortment planning through the combined efforts of these teams we continue to improve our overall inventory productivity and instock position 

intellectual property 

our subsidiary tractor supply co of texas lp “tsct” owns registrations with the us patent and trademark office “uspto” for various service marks including tsc ®  tractor supply co ®  tsc tractor supply co ®  and the trapezium design for retail store services we consider these service marks and the accompanying goodwill and name recognition to be valuable assets of our business tsct also owns several other service marks for retail services some of which have been registered with the uspto and some of which are the subject of applications for registration pending before the uspto 

in addition to selling products that bear nationallyknown manufacturer brands we also sell products manufactured for us under a number of exclusive brands that we consider to be important to our business these exclusive brands are manufactured for us by a number of vendors and provide an alternative to the national brands which helps provide value for our customers and positions us as a destination store 

our exclusive brands represented approximately 31  25  and 23  of our total sales in fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively our exclusive brands include 

 

the exclusive brands identified above have been registered with the uspto for certain products and are the subject of applications for registration pending before the uspto for other products 

our trademark and service mark registrations have various expiration dates however provided that we continue to use the marks and renew the registrations in a timely manner the registrations are potentially perpetual in duration 

we believe our intellectual property which includes the trademarks and service marks identified above together with certain trade names domain names copyrights and patents has significant value and is an important component of our merchandising and marketing strategies 

distribution 

we currently operate a distribution network for supplying stores with merchandise and in fiscal 2013  our stores received approximately 71  of merchandise through this network while approximately 29  of merchandise was shipped directly to the stores from our vendors we believe this flow facilitates the prompt and efficient distribution of merchandise to our stores in order to enhance sales and improve our inventory turnover rate our seven  distribution centers located in georgia indiana kentucky maryland nebraska texas and washington represent total distribution capacity of 39 million  square feet in 2013  we completed construction on a new distribution center a 684000 square foot facility in macon georgia which includes an import center it replaced our 521000 square foot leased distribution center in braselton georgia and became operational in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 we continue to improve the technology in our distribution centers and currently four of our seven  facilities utilize a new warehouse management system that provides for better movement of inventory through increased use of conveyors and automation we will continue to refine this new system and expect that it will be implemented in additional locations 

we select the locations of our distribution centers in an effort to minimize logistics costs and optimize the distance from distribution centers to our stores we manage our inbound and outbound transportation activity inhouse through the use of a webbased transportation management system we utilize several common carriers for store deliveries we manage our transportation costs through carrier negotiations the monitoring of transportation routes and the scheduling of deliveries 

marketing 

we utilize an everyday value price philosophy to consistently offer our products at competitive prices complemented by strategically planned promotions throughout the year we regularly monitor prices at competing stores and adjust our prices as appropriate 

to drive store traffic and position ourselves as a destination store we promote broad selections of merchandise with newspaper circulars customer targeted direct mail and email and internet offerings vendors frequently support these specific programs by offering temporary cost reductions honoring coupons and funding gift card rebate programs our vendors also provide assistance with product presentation and fixture design brochures support for instore events and pointofpurchase materials for customer education and product knowledge for our team members 

multichannel 

we communicate with our customers across multiple touch points including our stores ecommerce website  tractorsupplycom  email and direct mail our goal is to be available when and how our customers choose to engage with our brand connecting with consumers online provides the opportunity to allow customers to shop at a time and place that fits their schedule while delivering enhanced product information research and decision tools that support product selection and informational needs in specific subject areas we give our customers the ability to purchase products and have them shipped to one of our retail stores their homes or offices we believe this capability further enhances customer service and extends our market to areas where our retail stores are not currently located additionally in 2013 we upgraded our ecommerce website to include the integration of order management added extensive products offerings for vendor direct to customer drop shipments and transitioned to inhouse warehouse fulfillment for products that we stock 

management and team members 

as of december 28 2013  we employed approximately 10200  fulltime and 9000  parttime team members we also employ additional parttime team members during peak periods we are not party to any collective bargaining agreements 

our store operations are organized into eight regions each region is led by a vice president of operations and the region is further organized into districts which are led by a district manager or area manager we have internal advisory boards one comprised of store managers and the other comprised of district managers these groups bring a grassroots perspective to operational initiatives and generate chainwide endorsement of proposed bestpractice solutions 

all of our team members participate in one of various incentive programs which provide the opportunity to receive additional compensation based upon team andor company performance we also provide our eligible team members the opportunity to participate in an employee stock purchase plan and a 401k retirement savings plan we contribute to the 401k retirement savings plan solely through a cash match of 100 of the employee’s elective contributions up to 3  of eligible compensation plus 50  of the employee’s elective contributions from 3  to 6  of eligible compensation additionally we share in the cost of health insurance provided to our team members and team members receive a discount on merchandise purchased at our stores 

we encourage a promotefromwithin environment when internal resources permit we also provide internal leadership development programs designed to mentor our highpotential team members for continued progress our current team of district managers area managers and store managers have an average tenure of approximately six years management believes internal promotions coupled with the hiring of individuals with previous retail experience will provide the management structure necessary to support our planned growth

system a warehouse management system a price optimization system a vendor purchase order control system and a merchandise presentation system these systems are integrated through an enterprise resource planning “erp” system this erp system tracks merchandise from initial order through ultimate sale and interfaces with our financial systems 

we continue to evaluate and improve the functionality of our systems to maximize their effectiveness such efforts include ongoing hardware and software evaluations refreshes and upgrades to support optimal software configurations and application performance we plan to continue to upgrade our information technology and implement other efficiencydriving system enhancements including the continued rollout of a new warehouse management system to distribution centers significant feature enhancements to our ecommerce platform an enhanced demand planning system and store and support center hardware refreshes in 2014  we will continue to strengthen the security of our information systems and support store and distribution center expansion these efforts are directed toward improving business processes and achieving the most efficient and effective use of systems to manage our operations while ensuring a secure and reliable environment 

growth strategy 

our current and longterm growth strategy is to 1 expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores 2 enhance financial performance through comparable store sales growth achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an “everyday value price” philosophy and supported by strong customer service 3 enhance product margin through strategic product sourcing inventory and markdown management a strong exclusive brand offering and optimization of product pricing and transportation costs 4 leverage operating costs by focusing on opportunities for continuous improvement and elimination of waste in all of our processes 5 expand market opportunities via ecommerce and internetsupported sales accomplished by improving our website product content and enhancing our customers’ online experience and 6 expand through selective acquisition as such opportunities arise to enhance penetration into new and existing markets to complement organic growth 

over the past five years we have experienced considerable sales growth resulting in a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 114  we plan to open 102  to 106  new stores in 2014  a selling square footage increase of approximately 8  we opened 102  new stores in 2013  and 93  new stores in 2012  selling square footage increases of approximately 83  and 79  respectively 

we operated 1276  retail farm and ranch stores in 48  states as of december 28 2013  given the size of the communities that we target we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in many existing and new markets we have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 800  additional markets for new tractor supply stores approximately 56  of our stores are in freestanding buildings and 44  are located in strip shopping centers we lease approximately 93  of our store sites and own the remaining 7  of store sites 

competition 

we operate in a competitive retail industry the principal competitive factors include location of stores price and quality of merchandise instock consistency merchandise assortment and presentation and customer service we compete with general merchandise retailers home center retailers specialty and discount retailers independently owned retail farm and ranch stores numerous privatelyheld regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives as well as internetbased retailers however we believe we successfully differentiate ourselves from many of these retailers by focusing on our specialized market niche for customers living the rural lifestyle see further discussion of competition in 1a risk factors of this annual report on form 10k 

seasonality and weather 

our business is seasonal historically our sales and profits are the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products in past years weather conditions including unseasonably warm weather in winter months and extreme weather conditions including snow and ice storms flood and wind damage hurricanes tornadoes extreme rain and droughts have affected our sales and results of operations both positively and negatively our strategy is to remain flexible and react to extreme weather conditions by adjusting our merchandise assortments and redirecting inventories to stores affected by the weather conditions we experience our highest inventory and accounts payable balances during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal products to support the higher sales volume of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter to support the higher sales volume of the coldweather selling season 

stewardship and compliance with environmental matters 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment we are committed to conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner this commitment impacts all areas of our business including investments in store construction and maintenance energy usage supply chain product selection responsible packaging recycling and delivery of product knowledge to our customers

 item 1a  

risk factors 

tableend 

our business faces many risks those risks of which we are currently aware and deem to be material are described below if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur our business financial condition or results of operations may significantly suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this form 10k 

general economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance 

our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending including discretionary spending a weakening of economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as lower employment levels uncertainty or changes in business or political conditions higher interest rates higher tax rates higher fuel and energy costs higher labor and healthcare costs the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to other competitors a general reduction in the level of discretionary spending shifts in consumer discretionary spending to our competitors or shifts in discretionary spending to less profitable products sold by us could result in lower net sales slower inventory turnover greater markdowns on inventory and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins 

purchase price volatility including inflationary and deflationary pressures may adversely affect our financial performance 

although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items steel grain petroleum corn cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services therefore we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost which may impact consumer demand and as a result sales and gross margin our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale from increased volume of purchases adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors while maintaining product quality should our strategy to mitigate purchase price volatility not be effective our financial performance could be adversely impacted 

we may be unable to increase sales at our existing stores 

we experience fluctuations in our comparable store sales defined as sales in stores which have been open for at least twelve months our success depends in part upon our ability to improve sales at our existing stores various factors affect comparable store sales including the general retail sales environment our ability to efficiently source and distribute products changes in our merchandise assortment competition current economic conditions customer satisfaction with our products the timing of promotional events the release of new merchandise the success of marketing programs and weather conditions these factors may cause our comparable store sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations past comparable store sales are not necessarily an indication of future results and there can be no assurance that our comparable store sales will not decrease in the future 

capital requirements for growth may not be available 

the construction and opening or acquisition of new stores store support center facilities distribution facilities or other facilities along with the remodeling and renovation of existing stores require significant amounts of capital in the past our growth has been funded primarily through internally generated cash flow and bank borrowings disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the ability of the banks to meet their commitments our access to funds under our senior credit facility which provides for borrowings of up to 250 million  with an increase option for 150 million  subject to additional lender group commitments is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time in addition tighter lending practices have made it more challenging for our real estate developers to obtain financing under acceptable loan terms and conditions unfavorable lending trends could impact the timing of our store openings and materially adversely affect our ability to open new stores in desirable locations 

longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty changing or increased regulation reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases cash dividends or other discretionary uses of cash 

failure to open and manage new stores in the number and manner currently contemplated could adversely affect our financial performance 

an integral part of our business strategy includes the expansion of our store base through new store openings this expansion strategy is dependent on our ability to find suitable locations and we face competition from many retailers for such sites if we are unable to implement this strategy our ability to increase our sales profitability and cash flow could be impaired significantly to the extent that we are unable to open new stores in the manner we anticipate due to among other reasons site approval or unforeseen delays in construction our sales growth may be impeded 

as we execute this expansion strategy we may also experience managerial or operational challenges which may prevent any expected increase in sales profitability or cash flow our ability to manage our planned expansion depends on the adequacy of our existing information systems the efficiency and expansion of our distribution systems the adequacy of the hiring and training process for new personnel especially store managers the effectiveness of our controls and procedures and the ability to identify customer demand in different geographic areas there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our planned expansion that the new stores will be effectively integrated into our existing operations or that such stores will be profitable 

although we have a rigorous real estate site selection and approval process there can be no assurance that our new store openings will be successful or result in incremental sales and profitability for the company new stores build their sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection over time and as a result generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales than our more mature stores as we continue to open new stores there may be a negative impact on our results from a lower contribution margin of these new stores until their sales levels ramp to chain average if at all as well as from the impact of related preopening costs 

we may pursue strategic acquisitions and the failure of an acquisition to produce the anticipated results or the inability to fully integrate the acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business 

we may from time to time acquire businesses we believe to be complementary to our business the success of an acquisition is based on our ability to make accurate assumptions regarding the valuation operations growth potential integration and other factors relating to the respective business acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and may result in the diversion of our capital and our managements attention from other business issues and opportunities we may not be able to successfully integrate operations that we acquire including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and 

general operating procedures if we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions we could experience increased costs associated with operating inefficiencies which could have an adverse effect on our financial results also while we employ several different methodologies to assess potential business opportunities the new businesses may not meet or exceed our expectations and therefore adversely affect our financial performance 

competition may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations 

we operate in the highly competitive retail merchandise sector with numerous competitors these competitors include general merchandise retailers home center retailers other specialty retailers internet retailers independently owned farm and ranch stores regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives we compete for customers merchandise real estate locations and employees this competitive environment subjects us to various other risks including the inability to continue our store and sales growth and to provide attractive merchandise to our customers at competitive prices that allow us to maintain our profitability our failure to compete effectively in this environment could adversely impact our financial performance 

weather conditions may have a significant impact on our financial results 

weather conditions affect the demand for and in some cases the supply of products which in turn has an impact on prices in past years weather conditions including unseasonably warm weather in winter months and extreme weather conditions including snow and ice storms flood and wind damage hurricanes tornadoes extreme rain and droughts have affected our sales and results of operations both positively and negatively our strategy is to remain flexible and to react to extreme weather conditions by adjusting our merchandise assortments and redirecting inventories to stores affected by the weather conditions should such a strategy not be effective the weather may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our merchandising initiatives and marketing emphasis may not provide expected results 

we believe our past performance has been based on and future success will depend upon in part the ability to develop and execute merchandising initiatives with effective marketing programs these merchandising initiatives and marketing programs may not deliver expected results and there is no assurance that we will correctly identify and respond in a timely manner to evolving trends consumer preferences and expectations if we misjudge the market or our marketing programs are not successful we may overstock unpopular products and be forced to take inventory price reductions that have a material adverse influence on our profitability failure to execute and promote such initiatives in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow the business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition shortages of key merchandise could also have a material adverse impact on operating results and financial condition 

we face risks associated with vendors from whom our products are sourced 

the products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors we have agreements with our vendors in which the vendors agree to comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and to indemnify us against certain liabilities and costs our ability to recover liabilities and costs under these vendor agreements is dependent upon the financial condition and integrity of the vendors 

we rely on longterm relationships with our suppliers but have no longterm contracts with such suppliers our future success will depend in large measure upon our ability to maintain our existing supplier relationships or to develop new ones this reliance exposes us to the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various products due to political economic social or environmental conditions transportation delays or changes in laws and regulations affecting distribution our vendors may be forced to reduce their production shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection which could make it difficult for us to serve the market’s needs and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we rely on foreign manufacturers for various products that we sell in addition many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources as an importer our business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business internationally such as foreign governmental regulations economic disruptions delays in shipments transportation capacity and costs currency exchange rates and changes in political or economic conditions in countries from which we purchase products if any such factors were to render the conduct of business in particular countries undesirable or impractical or if additional united states quotas duties taxes or other charges or restrictions were imposed upon the importation of our products in the future our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our failure to attract and retain qualified team members could adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to continue expanding operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified team members our ability to meet labor needs while controlling wage and related labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force unemployment levels prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation if we are unable to 

locate attract or retain qualified personnel or if costs of labor or related costs increase significantly our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we are be subject to personal injury workers compensation product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business 

our business involves a risk of personal injury workers compensation product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business product liability claims from customers and product recalls for merchandise alleged to be defective or harmful could lead to the disposal or writeoff of merchandise inventories the incurrence of fines or penalties and damage to our reputation we maintain general liability and workers compensation insurance with selfinsured retention for each policy type and a deductible for each occurrence we also maintain umbrella limits above the primary general liability and product liability coverage in many cases we have indemnification rights against the manufacturers of the products and their products liability insurance our ability to recover costs and damages under such insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject to the financial viability of the insurers and manufacturers and the specific allegations of a claim no assurance can be given that our insurance coverage or the manufacturers’ indemnity will be available or sufficient in any claims brought against us 

our costs of doing business could increase as a result of adoption of new changes in or increased enforcement of federal state local or foreign laws and regulations 

we are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and governmental regulations relating to environmental protection personal injury intellectual property consumer product safety building land use and zoning requirements workplace regulations wage and hour privacy and information security and employment law matters if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations or if these laws or regulations are violated by importers manufacturers or distributers we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

we are also subject to the foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa which prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business and the antibribery laws of other jurisdictions failure to comply with the fcpa and similar laws could subject us to among other things penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our business customers employees and vendors that we hold whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise could damage our reputation with customers employees and vendors could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation and could adversely affect our operating results 

we receive certain personal information about our customers employees and vendors we also rely on business partners to provide services to us that may include important business information or data about our customers employees and vendors in addition our online operations at tractorsupplycom  depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments while we maintain substantial security measures to protect and to prevent unauthorized access to such information it is possible that unauthorized parties through cyberattacks which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated or by other means might compromise our security measures and obtain the personal information of customers employees and vendors that we hold or other confidential company data such an occurrence could adversely affect our reputation with our customers employees and vendors as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties moreover a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures that we employ to guard such important personal information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our online sales operations 

in addition states and the federal government are increasingly enacting laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft these laws will likely increase the costs of doing business and if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these new laws we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies which could harm our business 

as customerfacing technologies systems become an increasingly important part of our multichannel sales and marketing strategy the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences 

through our continued information technology enhancements we are able to provide an improved overall shopping environment and a multichannel experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers tablets smart phones and other mobile communication devices we use our website both as a sales channel for our products and also as a method of providing product project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both instore and online sales multichannel 

retailing is continually evolving and expanding and we must effectively respond to changing customer expectations and new developments disruptions failures or other performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and instore business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers 

a significant disruption to our distribution network or to the timely receipt of inventory could adversely impact sales or increase our transportation costs which would decrease our profits 

we rely on our distribution and transportation network to provide goods to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner through deliveries to our distribution centers from vendors and then from the distribution centers or direct ship vendors to our stores by various means of transportation including shipments by sea air rail and truck any disruption unanticipated expense or operational failure related to this process could affect store operations negatively for example unexpected delivery delays including delays due to weather fuel shortages or other reasons or increases in transportation costs including increased fuel costs or a decrease in transportation capacity for overseas shipments could significantly decrease our ability to provide adequate product for sale resulting in lower sales and profitability in addition labor shortages or work stoppages in the transportation industry or longterm disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries could negatively affect our business also a fire tornado or other disaster at one of our distribution centers could disrupt our timely receiving processing and shipment of merchandise to our stores which could adversely affect our business 

the implementation of our supply chain initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail 

we maintain a network of distribution facilities and have plans to build new facilities to support our growth objectives delays in opening distribution centers could adversely affect our future operations by slowing store growth which may in turn reduce revenue growth in addition distributionrelated construction or expansion projects entail risks which could cause delays and cost overruns such as shortages of materials shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages unforeseen construction scheduling engineering environmental or geological problems weather interference fires or other casualty losses and unanticipated cost increases the completion date and ultimate cost of future projects could differ significantly from initial expectations due to constructionrelated or other reasons we cannot guarantee that all projects will be completed on time or within established budgets 

we continue to make significant technology investments in our supply chain these initiatives are designed to streamline our distribution process so that we can optimize the delivery of goods and services to our stores and distribution centers in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives including those associated with managing thirdparty service providers and employing new webbased tools and services could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term in addition our improved supply chain technology might not provide the anticipated benefits it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the initiatives might fail altogether 

if we are unable to maintain or upgrade our management information systems and software programs or if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient and our strategic business initiatives may not be successful 

we depend on management information systems for many aspects of our business we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that we can continue to support our business we could be materially adversely affected if our management information systems are disrupted or if we are unable to improve upgrade maintain and expand systems particularly in light of the contemplated continued store growth 

the success of our strategic business initiatives designed to increase our sales and improve margin is dependent in varying degrees on the timely delivery and the functionality of information technology systems to support them extended delays or cost overruns in securing developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support the strategic business initiatives would delay and possibly even prevent us from realizing the projected benefits of those initiatives 

we cannot provide any guaranty of future dividend payments or that we will continue to repurchase our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program 

although our board of directors has indicated an intention to pay future quarterly cash dividends on our common stock any determination to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be based primarily upon our financial condition results of operations business requirements and our board of directors continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our stockholders and is in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the dividend furthermore although our board of directors has authorized a 1 billion share repurchase program through april 2015 we may discontinue this program at any time 

the market price for our common stock might be volatile and could result in a decline in value 

the price at which our common stock trades may be volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to our operating results general trends and prospects for the retail industry announcements by our competitors analyst recommendations our ability to meet or exceed analysts or investors expectations the condition of the financial markets and other factors the companys stock price is dependent in part on the multiple of earnings that investors are willing to pay that multiple is in part dependent on investors perception of the companys future earnings growth prospects if investor perceptions of the companys earnings growth prospects change the companys earnings multiple may decline and its stock price could be adversely affected 

in addition the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies these fluctuations as well as general economic and market conditions may adversely affect the market price of our common stock notwithstanding our actual operating performance 

effective tax rate changes and results of examinations by taxing authorities could materially impact our results 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the earnings mix being lower than historical results in states where we have lower statutory rates and higher than historical results in states where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the internal revenue service irs and other state and local taxing authorities like many retailers a portion of our sales are to taxexempt customers the business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment these circumstances create risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance our results could be materially impacted by the determinations and expenses related to these and other proceedings by the irs and other state and local taxing authorities 

failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business and results 

the companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting an internal control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name 

our success depends on the value and strength of the tractor supply name the tractor supply name is integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business maintaining promoting and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide high quality merchandise and a consistent high quality customer experience our brand could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity failure to comply with ethical social product labor and environmental standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions any of these events could result in decreased revenue or otherwise adversely affect our business

overview 

tractor supply company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the united states and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and others who enjoy the rural lifestyle as well as tradesmen and small businesses as of december 28 2013  we operated 1276  retail stores in 48  states under the names tractor supply company  and del’s feed  farm supply  we also operate a website under the name tractorsupplycom  our stores are located primarily in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities and they offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise 

 

our current and longterm growth strategy is to 1 expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores 2 enhance financial performance through comparable store sales growth achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an “everyday value price” philosophy and supported by strong customer service 3 enhance product margin through strategic product sourcing inventory and markdown management a strong exclusive brand offering and optimization of product pricing and transportation costs 4 leverage operating costs by focusing on opportunities for continuous improvement and elimination of waste in all of our processes 5 expand market opportunities via ecommerce and internetsupported sales accomplished by improving our website product content and enhancing our customers’ online experience and 6 expand through selective acquisition as such opportunities arise to enhance penetration into new and existing markets to complement organic growth 

over the past five years we have experienced considerable growth in stores growing from 855 stores at the end of 2008 to 1276  stores at the end of fiscal 2013  and in sales with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 114  given the size of the communities that we target we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in existing and new markets we have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 800 additional markets for new tractor supply stores 

stock split 

on august 28 2013 our board of directors declared a twoforone split of our outstanding shares of common stock to be effected in the form of a stock dividend on september 26 2013 stockholders of record at the close of business on september 18 2013 received one additional share of common stock for each share owned by such stockholder all share and pershare information in the annual report on form 10k has been retroactively restated to reflect the stock split the total number of authorized common shares and the par value of each share was not changed by the split 

executive summary 

we opened 102  new stores in 2013  and 93  new stores in 2012  a selling square footage increase of approximately 83  and 79  respectively during 2013  we opened stores in 34 states including our first stores in arizona nevada and wyoming and in 2014  we expect to continue our expansion into these new markets 

we achieved strong performance in fiscal 2013  delivering diluted earnings per share growth of 221 232  versus 190  in fiscal 2012  

net sales increased 107  to 516 billion  in fiscal 2013 from 466 billion  in fiscal 2012  comparable store sales increased 48  in fiscal 2013 versus a 53 increase in fiscal 2012 gross profit increased 120 to 175 billion in fiscal 2013 from 157 billion

we ended the year with approximately 143 million  in cash after returning nearly 198 million  to our stockholders through stock repurchases and dividends 

significant accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our financial position andor results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 











quarterly financial data 

our unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2013  and 2012  are shown below in thousands except per share amounts 





a due to the nature of interim net income per share calculations the sum of quarterly net income per share amounts may not equal the reported net income per share for the year all net income per share amounts except the third quarter and fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 have been split adjusted 

results of operations 

our fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last saturday of the calendar year references to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ended the fiscal years ended december 28 2013  and december 29 2012  consisted of 52 weeks and the fiscal year ended december 31 2011  consisted of 53 weeks 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales 



 

a  our gross margin amounts may not be comparable to those of other retailers since some retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of merchandise sold and others like the company exclude a portion of these distribution network costs from gross margin and instead include them in selling general and administrative “sga” expenses refer to note 1 – significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

fiscal 2013  compared to fiscal 2012   

net sales increased   107  to 516 billion  in fiscal 2013  from 466 billion  in fiscal 2012  comparable store sales for fiscal 2013  were 489 billion  a 48   increase  over fiscal 2012  this compares to a 53  comparable store sales increase in the prior year the comparable store transaction count increased   47  while comparable store average ticket remained flat for fiscal 2013  principally as a result of big ticket sales being less of the sales mix comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in net sales of stores open at least one year and exclude certain adjustments to net sales 

the comparable store sales increase was driven by continued strong results in key consumable usable edible cue products principally animal and petrelated merchandise this was a result of continued investment in cue inventory expanded product assortments and improved localized product offerings winter seasonal merchandise predominantly heating and insulated outerwear also performed well during the first part of the year and the end of the year due to the colder than average weather we also estimate that comparable store sales were favorably impacted by approximately 70 basis points due to inflation principally in pet food and livestock feed 

in addition to comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2013  sales from new stores and stores opened less than one year were 2812 million  in fiscal 2013  which represented 60  percentage points of the 107  increase over fiscal 2012  net sales sales from stores opened less than one year were 2762 million  in fiscal 2012  which represented 65 percentage points of the 102 increase over fiscal 2011  net sales 

the following chart summarizes our store growth during fiscal 2013  and 2012  



the following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2013  and 2012  



gross profit increased   120  to 175 billion  in fiscal 2013 compared to 157 billion  in fiscal 2012  as a percent of sales gross margin increased   40  basis points to 340  for fiscal 2013  compared to 336  for fiscal 2012  this improvement in gross margin reflects improved direct product margin direct product margin increased as a result of continued progress on our four strategic margin initiatives which include inventory and markdown management strategic sourcing exclusive branding and retail price management 

as a percent of sales sga expenses including depreciation and amortization improved 20  basis points to 240  in fiscal 2013  from 242  in fiscal 2012  the sga improvement as a percent of sales was primarily attributable to the leverage of continued solid comparable store sales growth expense control related to store operating costs and lower yearoveryear incentive compensation expense partially offset by costs related to the new and expanded southeast distribution center and relocation of our corporate data center total sga expenses for fiscal 2013   increased   97  to 124 billion  from 113 billion  in fiscal 2012  the increase in sga primarily reflects new store growth and variable costs associated with our comparable store sales growth as well as operating costs relating to our new and expanded southeast distribution center and corporate data center 

our effective tax rate decreased  to 362  for fiscal 2013  compared to 366  in fiscal 2012  the reduction in the tax rate resulted primarily from the favorable impact of the reversal of various reserves for uncertain tax positions 

as a result of the foregoing factors net income for fiscal 2013   increased   187  to 3282 million  or 232  per diluted share as compared to net income of 2765 million  or 190  per diluted share in fiscal 2012  

during fiscal 2013  we repurchased approximately 23 million  shares of the companys common stock at a total cost of 1294 million  as part of our previously announced 1 billion  share repurchase program in fiscal 2012  we repurchased approximately 61 million  shares at a total cost of 2718 million  

fiscal 2012  compared to fiscal 2011   

net sales increased 102 to 466 billion in fiscal 2012 from 423 billion in fiscal 2011 fiscal 2012 included one less sales week compared to fiscal 2011 as a part of the companys 53week calendar in fiscal 2011 adjusting for the impact of the extra sales week in fiscal 2011 our fiscal 2012 net sales increase was 116 comparable store sales for fiscal 2012 were 439 billion a 53 increase over fiscal 2011 this compares to an 82 comparable store sales increase in the prior year the comparable store transaction count increased 30 while comparable store average ticket increased 20 for fiscal 2012 

the comparable store sales increase was driven by continued strong results in cue products principally animal and petrelated merchandise we estimate that comparable store sales were favorably impacted by approximately 250 basis points due to inflation principally in key cue categories 

in addition to comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2012 sales from new stores and stores opened less than one year were 2762 million in fiscal 2012 which represented 65 percentage points of the 102 increase over fiscal 2011 net sales sales from stores opened less than one year were 2375 million in fiscal 2011 which represented 64 percentage points of the 163 increase over fiscal 2010 net sales 

the following chart summarizes our store growth during fiscal 2012  and 2011  



the following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2012  and 2011  



gross profit increased 113 to 157 billion in fiscal 2012 compared to 141 billion in fiscal 2011 as a percent of sales gross margin increased 40 basis points to 336 for fiscal 2012 compared to 332 for fiscal 2011 these changes reflect improved direct product margin partially offset by increased transportation costs direct product margin increased as we continued to make progress on our four strategic margin initiatives which include inventory and markdown management strategic sourcing exclusive branding and price optimization transportation costs increased primarily as a result of higher fuel costs coupled with the continued mix shift to more freightintensive cue products 

as a percent of sales sga expenses including depreciation and amortization improved 70 basis points to 242 in fiscal 2012 from 249 in fiscal 2011 this improvement was primarily attributable to the leverage of continued strong comparable store sales expense control related to store operating costs and lower yearoveryear incentive compensation expense total sga expenses for fiscal 2012 increased 71 to 113 billion from 105 billion in fiscal 2011 the increase in sga primarily reflects new store growth as well as operating costs relating to our franklin kentucky distribution center which became operational in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 offset in part by the favorable impact of one less week in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 as part of the companys 53week calendar in the prior year 

our effective tax rate increased to 366 for fiscal 2012 compared to 365 in fiscal 2011 the change in the effective tax rate was principally due to a reduction in the benefit provided by certain federal tax credits during fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 

as a result of the foregoing factors net income for fiscal 2012 increased 241 to 2765 million or 190 per diluted share as compared to net income of 2227 million or 151 per diluted share in fiscal 2011 

during fiscal 2012 we repurchased approximately 61 million shares of the companys common stock at a total cost of 2718 million as part of our previously announced 1 billion share repurchase program in fiscal 2011 we repurchased approximately 62 million shares at a total cost of 1800 million 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

in addition to normal operating expenses our primary ongoing cash requirements are for new store expansion remodeling and relocation programs distribution center and store support center capacity and improvements information technology inventory purchases share repurchases and cash dividends our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are existing cash balances funds provided from operations borrowings available under our senior credit facility capital and operating leases and normal trade credit our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters to support the higher sales volume of the spring and coldweather selling seasons respectively 

working capital 

at december 28 2013  the company had working capital of 6771 million  which increased   1076 million  from december 29 2012  the shifts in working capital were attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities in millions 



in comparison to december 29 2012 working capital as of december 28 2013  was impacted most significantly by changes in our inventory and income taxes payable 

 

borrowings and credit facilities 

the senior credit facility provides for borrowings of up to 250 million  with a sublimit of 20 million  for swingline loans the senior credit facility has an increase option for 150 million subject to additional lender group commitments this agreement is unsecured and matures in october 2016  with proceeds available to be used for working capital capital expenditures dividends share repurchases and other matters 

at december 28 2013  and december 29 2012  there were no outstanding borrowings under the senior credit facility there were 382 million  and 514 million  outstanding letters of credit under the senior credit facility as of december 28 2013  and december 29 2012  respectively borrowings bear interest at either the bank’s base rate  325  at december 28 2013  or the london interbank offer rate “libor”  016  at december 28 2013  plus an additional amount ranging from 040  to 100  per annum  050  at december 28 2013  adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio we are also required to pay quarterly in arrears a commitment fee for unused capacity ranging from 008  to 020  per annum  010  at december 28 2013  adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio there are no compensating balance requirements associated with the senior credit facility 

the senior credit facility requires quarterly compliance with respect to two material covenants a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio the fixed charge coverage ratio compares earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization stock compensation and rent expense “consolidated ebitdar” to the sum of interest paid and rental expense excluding any straightline rent adjustments the leverage ratio compares total debt plus rental expense excluding any straightline rent adjustments multiplied by a factor of six to consolidated ebitdar the senior credit facility also contains certain other restrictions regarding additional indebtedness capital expenditures business operations guarantees investments mergers consolidations and sales of assets transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates and liens we were in compliance with all covenants at december 28 2013  

sources and uses of cash 

our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures while uses of cash for financing activities are repurchase of the company’s common stock and cash dividends paid to stockholders the following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years in millions 



operating activities 

operating activities provided net cash of 3337 million  3783 million  and 2541 million  in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the 446 million   decrease  in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2013  compared to fiscal 2012  was primarily due to changes in the following operating activities in millions 



the 446 million  decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 primarily relates to increased inventory levels a reduction in accounts payable and timing of estimated tax payments partially offset by an increase in net earnings inventory increased in proportion to store growth as expected but the accounts payable balance declined year over year the timing of receipt of seasonal goods was much earlier in the fourth quarter in the current year and imports made up a larger percentage of fourth quarter receipts requiring payment on trade credit prior to year end these factors drove the decline in accounts payable income taxes payable declined due to the timing of estimated tax payments resulting from changes in allowable deductions for depreciation expense 

the 1242 million  increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2012  over fiscal 2011  is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities in millions 



the change in deferred income taxes is due primarily to temporary differences related to tax law changes regarding depreciation inventory net of accounts payable increased at a lesser rate compared to prior year as we achieved a higher increase in accounts payable relative to inventory primarily due to timing of payments income taxes payable increased due to higher income in the period as well as timing of estimated tax payments as a result of changes in allowable deductions for depreciation expense 

investing activities 

investing activities used cash of 2093 million  1391 million  and 1713 million in fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively the increase in cash used for investing activities primarily reflects an increase in capital expenditures slightly offset by a reduction in restricted cash the decrease in restricted cash during fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 related to less cash required as collateral for an outstanding letter of credit at a financial institution outside of the senior credit facility capital expenditures for fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 were as follows in millions 



the above table reflects 102  new stores and three  relocations during fiscal 2013  compared to 93  new stores and one  relocation during fiscal 2012  we purchased three of our existing leased stores during fiscal 2013  compared to five existing leased stores in fiscal 2012  the capital expenditures in fiscal 2013  for distribution center capacity and improvements relate primarily to the construction of our new macon georgia distribution center which is the relocation of our former southeast distribution center in braselton georgia the increase in corporate and other primarily reflects the construction of our new store support center in brentwood tennessee 

  

we currently estimate that capital expenditures will range between 240 million and 250 million in fiscal 2014  

 31 

financing activities 

financing activities used cash of 1203 million 2775 million and 1632 million  in fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively the cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2013 was mainly the result of repurchases of common stock and quarterly cash dividends paid to stockholders partially offset by net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to sharebased compensation and excess tax benefits recognized on options exercised the reduction in net cash used in financing activities is largely due to 1424 million  less in common stock repurchases in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 

our board of directors has authorized common stock repurchases under the share repurchase program up to 1 billion  exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses related to such repurchases through april 2015  the repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions the timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors including price corporate and regulatory requirements capital availability and other market conditions repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance the program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice 

we repurchased approximately 23 million  61 million  and 62 million  shares of common stock under the share repurchase program at a total cost of 1294 million  2718 million  and 1800 million  in fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively as of december 28 2013  we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of 1618 million  exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses 

in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 we increased our quarterly dividend from 010 per share to 013 per share and in the second quarter of fiscal 2012 we increased our quarterly dividend from 006 per share to 010 per share we paid dividends totaling 685 million  513 million  and 309 million  in fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

we believe that our existing cash balances expected cash flow from future operations borrowings available under the senior credit facility operating and capital leases and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs including new store openings store acquisitions relocations and renovations new store support center and distribution center capacity through the end of fiscal 2014 

significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of december 28 2013  in thousands 



a capital lease obligations include related interest 

b reflects 60 million  for the land and construction of stores expected to be opened in fiscal 2014 and 220 million  for the construction of our new store support center 

at december 28 2013  there were 382 million  outstanding letters of credit under the senior credit facility and an 183 million  outstanding letter of credit at a financial institution outside of the senior credit facility 

effective april 1 2013 the outstanding letter of credit at the financial institution outside of the senior credit facility increased from 84 million to 183 million and the restriction on 84 million in restricted cash lapsed 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements are limited to operating leases and outstanding letters of credit the balances for these arrangements are previously discussed we typically lease buildings for retail stores and offices rather than acquiring these assets which allows us to utilize financial capital to operate the business rather than invest in fixed assets letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory primarily sourced overseas in a timely manner and support certain risk management programs 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we may be exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from the senior credit facility the senior credit facility bears interest at either the bank’s base rate  325  at both december 28 2013  and december 29 2012  or libor  016 and 021  at december 28 2013  and december 29 2012  respectively plus an additional amount ranging from 040  to 100  per annum  050  at both december 28 2013  and december 29 2012  adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio we are also required to pay quarterly in arrears a commitment fee for unused capacity ranging from 008  to 020  per annum  010  at both december 28 2013  and december 29 2012  adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio 

purchase price volatility 

although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items steel grain petroleum corn cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services therefore we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost which may impact consumer demand and as a result sales and gross margin our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale from increased volume of purchases adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality

our buying team focuses on merchandise procurement vendor line reviews assortment planning and testing of new products and programs we also employ a dedicated inventory management team that focuses exclusively on all forecasting and replenishment functions through the combined efforts of these teams we continue to improve our overall inventory productivity and instock position 

intellectual property 

our subsidiary tractor supply co of texas lp “tsct” owns registrations with the us patent and trademark office “uspto” for the service marks tsc ®  tractor supply co ®  tsc tractor supply co ®  and the trapezium design for retail store services we consider these service marks and the accompanying goodwill and name recognition to be valuable assets of our business tsct also owns several other service marks for retail services some of which have been registered with the uspto and some of which are the subject of applications for registration pending before the uspto 

in addition to selling products that bear nationallyknown manufacturer brands we also sell products manufactured for us under a number of exclusive brands that we consider to be important to our business these exclusive brands are manufactured for us 

by a number of vendors and provide an alternative to the national brands which helps provides value for our customers and positions us as a destination store

we believe our intellectual property which includes the trademarks and service marks identified above together with certain trade names domain names copyrights and patents has significant value and is an important component of our merchandising and marketing strategies 

distribution 

we currently operate a distribution network for supplying our stores with merchandise and in fiscal 2012  our stores received approximately 70  of our merchandise through this network while approximately 30  of our merchandise is shipped direct to the store from our vendors we believe this flow facilitates the prompt and efficient distribution of merchandise to our stores in order to enhance sales and improve our inventory turnover rate our seven  distribution centers located in georgia indiana kentucky maryland nebraska texas and washington represent total distribution capacity of 38 million  square feet in 2012  we started construction on a new distribution center a 686000 square foot facility in macon georgia which will replace our 521000 square foot leased distribution center in braselton georgia and become operational in midtolate 2013 we continue to improve the technology in our distribution centers and currently three of our seven  facilities utilize a new warehouse management system that provides for better movement of inventory through increased use of conveyors and automation we will continue to refine this new system and expect that it will be implemented across the entire distribution network over the next few years

to generate store traffic and position ourselves as a destination store we promote broad selections of merchandise with newspaper circulars customer targeted direct mail and email and internet offerings vendors frequently support these specific programs by offering temporary cost reductions honoring coupons and funding gift card rebate programs our vendors also provide assistance with product presentation and fixture design brochures support for instore events and pointofpurchase materials for customer education and product knowledge for our team members

management and team members 

as of december 29 2012  we employed approximately 9400  fulltime and 7900  parttime team members we also employ additional parttime team members during peak periods we are not party to any collective bargaining agreements 

our store operations are organized into eight regions each region is led by a regional manager and the region is further organized into districts which are led by a district manager or area manager we have internal advisory boards one comprised of store managers and the other comprised of district managers these groups bring a grassroots perspective to operational initiatives and generate chainwide endorsement of proposed bestpractice solutions 

all of our team members participate in one of various incentive programs which provide the opportunity to receive additional compensation based upon team andor company performance we also provide our eligible team members the opportunity to participate in an employee stock purchase plan and a 401k retirement savings plan we contribute to the 401k retirement savings plan solely through a cash match additionally we share in the cost of health insurance provided to our team members and team members receive a discount on merchandise purchased at our stores

over the past five years we have experienced considerable sales growth with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 115  we plan to open 100  to 105  new stores in 2013  a selling square footage increase of approximately 8  we opened 93  new stores in 2012  and 85  new stores in 2011  selling square footage increases of approximately 81  and 78  respectively 

we operated 1176  retail farm and ranch stores in 45  states as of december 29 2012  given the size of the communities that we target we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in many existing and new markets we have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 900  additional markets for new tractor supply stores approximately 55  of our stores are in freestanding buildings and 45  are located in strip shopping centers we lease approximately 93  of our store sites and own the remaining 7  of store sites 

competition 

we operate in a competitive retail industry the principal competitive factors include location of stores price and quality of merchandise instock consistency merchandise assortment and presentation and customer service we compete with general merchandise retailers home center retailers specialty and discount retailers independently owned retail farm and ranch stores numerous privatelyheld regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives as well as internetbased retailers however we believe we successfully differentiate ourselves from many of these retailers by focusing on our specialized market niche for customers living the rural lifestyle see further discussion of competition in 1a risk factors of this annual report on form 10k 

seasonality

risk factors 

tableend 

our business faces many risks those risks of which we are currently aware and deem to be material are described below if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur our business financial condition or results of operations may significantly suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this form 10k 

general economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance 

our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending including discretionary spending a prolonged or further weakening of economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as continued lower employment levels uncertainty or changes in business conditions higher interest rates higher tax rates higher fuel and energy costs higher labor and healthcare costs the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to other competitors a general reduction in the level of discretionary spending shifts in consumer discretionary spending to our competitors or shifts in discretionary spending to less profitable products sold by us could result in lower net sales slower inventory turnover greater markdowns on inventory and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins 

purchase price volatility including inflationary and deflationary pressures may adversely affect our financial performance 

although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items steel grain petroleum corn cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services therefore we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost which may impact consumer demand and as a result sales and gross margin our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale from increased volume of purchases adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality should our strategy to mitigate purchase price volatility not be effective our financial performance could be adversely impacted 

we may be unable to increase sales at our existing stores 

we experience fluctuations in our samestore sales defined as sales in stores which have been opened for at least twelve months our success depends in part upon our ability to improve sales at our existing stores various factors affect samestore sales including the general retail sales environment our ability to efficiently source and distribute products changes in our merchandise assortment competition current economic conditions customer satisfaction with our products the timing of promotional events the release of new merchandise the success of marketing programs and weather conditions these factors may cause our samestore sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations past samestore sales are not necessarily an indication of future results and there can be no assurance that our samestore sales will not decrease in the future 

capital requirements for growth may not be available 

the construction and opening or acquisition of new stores and distribution facilities along with the remodeling and renovation of existing stores require significant amounts of capital in the past our growth has been funded primarily through internally generated cash flow and bank borrowings disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the ability of the banks to meet their commitments our access to funds under our senior credit facility which provides for borrowings of up to 250 million  is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time in addition tighter lending practices have made it more challenging for our real estate developers to obtain financing under acceptable loan terms and conditions unfavorable lending trends could impact the timing of our store openings and materially adversely affect our ability to open new stores in desirable locations 

longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty changing or increased regulation reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases cash dividends or other discretionary uses of cash 

failure to open and manage new stores in the number and manner currently contemplated could adversely affect our financial performance 

an integral part of our business strategy includes the expansion of our store base through new store openings this expansion strategy is dependent on our ability to find suitable locations and we face competition from many retailers for such sites if we are unable to implement this strategy our ability to increase our sales profitability and cash flow could be impaired significantly to the extent that we are unable to open new stores in the manner we anticipate due to among other reasons site approval or unforeseen delays in construction our sales growth may be impeded 

as we execute this expansion strategy we may also experience managerial or operational challenges which may prevent any expected increase in sales profitability or cash flow our ability to manage our planned expansion depends on the adequacy of our existing information systems the efficiency and expansion of our distribution systems the adequacy of the hiring and training process for new personnel especially store managers the effectiveness of our controls and procedures and the ability to identify customer demand in different geographic areas there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our planned expansion that the new stores will be effectively integrated into our existing operations or that such stores will be profitable 

although we have a rigorous real estate site selection and approval process there can be no assurance that our new store openings will be successful or result in incremental sales and profitability for the company new stores build their sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection over time and as a result generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales than our more mature stores as we continue to open new stores there may be a negative impact on our results from a lower contribution margin of these new stores until their sales levels ramp to chain average if at all as well as from the impact of related preopening costs 

we may pursue strategic acquisitions and the failure of an acquisition to produce the anticipated results or the inability to fully integrate the acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business 

we may from time to time acquire businesses we believe to be complementary to our business the success of an acquisition is based on our ability to make accurate assumptions regarding the valuation operations growth potential integration and other factors relating to the respective business acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and may result in the diversion of our capital and our managements attention from other business issues and opportunities we may not be able to successfully integrate operations that we acquire including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures if we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions we could experience increased costs associated with operating inefficiencies which could have an adverse effect on our financial results also while we employ several different methodologies to assess potential business opportunities the new businesses may not meet or exceed our expectations and therefore affect our financial performance 

competition in our industry may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations 

we operate in the highly competitive retail merchandise sector with numerous competitors these competitors include general merchandise retailers home center retailers other specialty retailers independently owned farm and ranch stores regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives we compete for customers merchandise real estate locations and employees this competitive environment subjects us to various other risks including the inability to continue our store and sales growth and to provide attractive merchandise to our customers at competitive prices that allow us to maintain our profitability our failure to compete effectively in this environment could adversely impact our financial performance 

weather conditions may have a significant impact on our financial results 

weather conditions affect the demand for and in some cases the supply of products which in turn has an impact on prices weather conditions directly affect the demand for seasonal products in particular especially during the winter heating season in past years weather conditions including unseasonably warm weather in winter months and extreme weather conditions including snow and ice storms flood and wind damage hurricanes tornadoes extreme rain and droughts have affected our sales and results of operations both positively and negatively our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the impact of weather conditions through geographic dispersion of our stores and taking advantage of our ability to effectively manage inventory allocation should such a strategy not be effective the weather is likely to have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our merchandising initiatives and marketing emphasis may not provide expected results 

we believe our past performance has been based on and future success will depend upon in part the ability to develop and execute merchandising initiatives with effective marketing there is no assurance that we will be successful or that new initiatives will be executed in a timely manner to satisfy our customers’ needs or expectations failure to execute and promote such initiatives in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow the business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition additionally our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demand and preferences for merchandise if we misjudge the market we may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to take significant inventory markdowns shortages of key items could also have a materially adverse impact on operating results 

we face risks associated with vendors from whom our products are sourced 

the products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors we have agreements with our vendors in which the vendors agree to comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and to indemnify us against certain liabilities and costs our ability to recover liabilities and costs under these vendor agreements is dependent upon the financial condition and integrity of the vendors 

we rely on longterm relationships with our suppliers but have no longterm contracts with such suppliers our future success will depend in large measure upon our ability to maintain our existing supplier relationships or to develop new ones this reliance exposes us to the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various products due to political economic social or environmental conditions transportation delays or changes in laws and regulations affecting distribution our vendors may be forced to reduce their production shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection which could make it difficult for us to serve the market’s needs and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we rely on foreign manufacturers for various products that we sell in addition many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources as an importer our business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business internationally such as foreign governmental regulations economic disruptions delays in shipments transportation capacity and costs currency exchange rates and changes in political or economic conditions in countries from which we purchase products if any such factors were to render the conduct of business in particular countries undesirable or impractical or if additional united states quotas duties taxes or other charges or restrictions were imposed upon the importation of our products in the future our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our failure to attract and retain qualified team members could adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to continue expanding operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified team members our ability to meet labor needs while controlling wage and related labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force unemployment levels prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation if we are unable to locate attract or retain qualified personnel or if costs of labor or related costs increase significantly our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we may be subject to product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business 

our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business product liability claims from customers and product recalls for merchandise alleged to be defective or harmful could lead to the disposal or writeoff of merchandise inventories the incurrence of fines or penalties and damage to our reputation we maintain general liability and workers compensation insurance with selfinsured retention for each policy type and a deductible for each occurrence we also maintain umbrella limits above the primary general liability and product liability coverage in many cases we have indemnification rights against the manufacturers of the products and their products liability insurance our ability to recover costs and damages under such insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject to the financial viability of the insurers and manufacturers and the specific allegations of a claim no assurance can be given that our insurance coverage or the manufacturers’ indemnity will be available or sufficient in any claims brought against us 

our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in increased enforcement of or adoption of new federal state local or foreign laws and regulations 

we are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and governmental regulations relating to environmental protection personal injury intellectual property consumer product safety building land use and zoning requirements workplace regulations wage and hour privacy and information security and employment law matters if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations or if these laws or regulations are violated by importers manufacturers or distributers we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

we are also subject to the foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” which prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and the antibribery laws of other jurisdictions failure to comply with the fcpa and similar laws could subject us to among other things penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our business customers employees and vendors that we hold whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise could damage our reputation with customers employees and vendors could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation and could adversely affect our operating results 

we receive certain personal information about our customers employees and vendors in addition our online operations at tractorsupplycom  depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments while we maintain substantial security measures to protect and to prevent unauthorized access to such information it is possible that unauthorized parties through cyberattacks which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated or by other means might compromise our security measures and obtain the personal information of customers employees and vendors that we hold or other confidential company data such an occurrence could adversely affect our reputation with our customers employees and vendors as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties moreover a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures that we employ to guard such important personal information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our online sales operations 

in addition states and the federal government are increasingly enacting laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft these laws will likely increase the costs of doing business and if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these new laws we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies which could harm our business 

a significant disruption to our distribution network or to the timely receipt of inventory could adversely impact sales or increase our transportation costs which would decrease our profits 

we rely on our distribution and transportation network to provide goods to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner through deliveries to our distribution centers from vendors and then from the distribution centers or direct ship vendors to our stores by various means of transportation including shipments by sea air rail and truck any disruption unanticipated expense or operational failure related to this process could affect store operations negatively for example unexpected delivery delays or increases in transportation costs including increased fuel costs or a decrease in transportation capacity for overseas shipments could significantly decrease our ability to provide adequate product for sale resulting in lower sales and profitability in addition labor shortages or work stoppages in the transportation industry or longterm disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries could negatively affect our business also a fire tornado or other disaster at one of our distribution centers could disrupt our timely receiving processing and shipment of merchandise to our stores which could adversely affect our business 

the implementation of our supply chain initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail 

we maintain a network of distribution facilities and have plans to build new facilities to support our growth objectives delays in opening distribution centers could adversely affect our future operations by slowing store growth which may in turn reduce revenue growth in addition distributionrelated construction or expansion projects entail risks which could cause delays and cost overruns such as shortages of materials shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages unforeseen construction scheduling engineering environmental or geological problems weather interference fires or other casualty losses and unanticipated cost increases the completion date and ultimate cost of future projects could differ significantly from initial expectations due to constructionrelated or other reasons we cannot guarantee that all projects will be completed on time or within established budgets 

we continue to make significant technology investments in our supply chain these initiatives are designed to streamline our distribution process so that we can optimize the delivery of goods and services to our stores and distribution centers in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives including those associated with managing thirdparty service providers and employing new webbased tools and services could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term in addition our improved supply chain technology might not provide the anticipated benefits it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the initiatives might fail altogether 

if we are unable to maintain or upgrade our management information systems and software programs or if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient and our strategic business initiatives may not be successful 

we depend on management information systems for many aspects of our business we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that we can continue to support our business we could be materially adversely affected if our management information systems are disrupted or if we are unable to improve upgrade maintain and expand systems particularly in light of the contemplated continued store growth 

the success of our strategic business initiatives designed to increase our sales and improve margin is dependent in varying degrees on the timely delivery and the functionality of information technology systems to support them extended delays or cost overruns in securing developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support the strategic business initiatives would delay and possibly even prevent us from realizing the projected benefits of those initiatives 

we cannot provide any guaranty of future dividend payments or that we will continue to repurchase our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program 

although our board of directors has indicated an intention to pay future quarterly cash dividends on our common stock any determination to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be based primarily upon our financial condition results of operations business requirements and our board of directors continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our stockholders and is in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the dividend furthermore although our board of directors has authorized a 1 billion share repurchase program through april 2015 we may discontinue this program at any time 

the market price for our common stock might be volatile and could result in a decline in value 

the price at which our common stock trades may be volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to our operating results general trends and prospects for the retail industry announcements by our competitors analyst recommendations our ability to meet or exceed analysts or investors expectations the condition of the financial markets and other factors in addition the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies these fluctuations as well as general economic and market conditions may adversely affect the market price of our common stock notwithstanding our actual operating performance 

effective tax rate changes and results of examinations by taxing authorities could materially impact our results 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the earnings mix being lower than historical results in states where we have lower statutory rates and higher than historical results in states where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the internal revenue service irs and other state and local taxing authorities like many retailers a portion of our sales are to taxexempt customers the business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment these circumstances create risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance our results could be materially impacted by the determinations and expenses related to these and other proceedings by the irs and other state and local taxing authorities 

failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business and results 

the companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting an internal control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the market price of our common stock

overview 

tractor supply company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the united states and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle as well as tradesmen and small businesses as of december 29 2012 we operated 1176  retail stores in 45  states under the names tractor supply company  and del’s feed  farm supply  we also operate a website under the name tractorsupplycom  our stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities and they offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise 

 

our current and longterm growth strategy is to 1 expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores 2 enhance financial performance through samestore sales growth achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an “everyday value price” philosophy and supported by strong customer service 3 enhance product margin through strategic product sourcing and regional allocation a strong exclusive brand offering and optimization of product pricing transportation and distribution costs 4 leverage operating costs especially advertising distribution and corporate overhead by focusing on opportunities for continuous improvement and elimination of waste in all of our processes 5 expand market opportunities via internet sales accomplished by improving our website product content and enhancing our customers’ online experience and 6 expand through selective acquisition as such opportunities arise to enhance penetration into new and existing markets to complement organic growth 

over the past five years we have experienced considerable growth in stores growing from 764 stores at the end of 2007 to 1176  stores at the end of fiscal 2012 and in sales with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 115  given the size of the communities that we target we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in existing and new markets we have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 900 additional markets for new tractor supply stores 

executive summary 

we opened 93  new stores in 2012  and 85  new stores in 2011  a selling square footage increase of approximately 81  and 78  respectively during 2012 we opened our first stores in colorado and in 2013 we expect to continue our expansion into new markets including arizona 

we achieved strong performance in fiscal 2012 delivering diluted earnings per share of 380  versus 301  in fiscal 2011  as stated in the prior year we estimate that the 53rd week in fiscal 2011 represented a benefit of approximately 009 per diluted share 

net sales increased to 466 billion  in 2012 or 102  over the prioryears 53week period 116 adjusted for the extra sales week in fiscal 2011 as part of the companys 53week calendar samestore sales increased 53 driven primarily by continued strong results in key consumable usable and edible cue products principally animal and petrelated merchandise as a percent of sales gross margin improved to 336 from 332 in the prior year our gross margin rate continues to benefit from key margindriving initiatives including strategic sourcing inventory and markdown management and price optimization 

we ended the year with 147 million  in cash and restricted cash after returning nearly 323 million  to our stockholders through stock repurchases and dividends

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our financial position andor results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 











quarterly financial data 

our unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2012  and 2011  are shown below in thousands except per share amounts 





a due to the nature of interim earnings per share calculations the sum of quarterly earnings per share amounts may not equal the reported earnings per share for the year 

b due to the 53week fiscal 2011 each quarter of fiscal 2012 started one week later than the same quarter of fiscal 2011 the chart below presents samestore sales for 2011 as originally reported and as adjusted to represent the same 13week period as the 2012 fiscal quarters the adjusted 13week periods ended on april 2 2011 july 2 2011 october 1 2011 and december 31 2011 respectively 



results of operations 

our fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last saturday of the calendar year references to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ended the fiscal year ended december 29 2012  consisted of 52 weeks the fiscal year ended december 31 2011  consisted of 53 weeks and the fiscal year ended december 25 2010  contained 52 weeks 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales 



 

a  our gross margin amounts may not be comparable to those of other retailers since some retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of merchandise sold and others like us exclude a portion of these distribution network costs from gross margin and instead include them in selling general and administrative “sga” expenses refer to note 1 – significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

fiscal 2012  compared to fiscal 2011   

net sales increased   102  to 466 billion  in fiscal 2012  from 423 billion  in fiscal 2011  fiscal 2012 included one less sales week compared to fiscal 2011 as a part of the companys 53week calendar in the prior year adjusting for the impact of the extra sales week in fiscal 2011 our fiscal 2012  net sales increase was 116 samestore sales for fiscal 2012  were 439 billion  a 53   increase  over fiscal 2011  this compares to a 82  samestore sales increase in the prior year the samestore transaction count increased   30  while samestore average ticket increased   20  for fiscal 2012  the samestore sales increase was driven by continued strong results in core consumable usable and edible cue products principally animal and petrelated merchandise we estimate that samestore sales were favorably impacted by approximately 250 basis points due to inflation principally in key cue categories 

in addition to samestore sales growth in fiscal 2012  sales from new stores and stores opened less than one year were 2762 million  in fiscal 2012  which represented 65  percentage points of the 102  increase over fiscal 2011  net sales 

the following chart summarizes our store growth during fiscal 2012  and 2011  



the following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2012  and 2011  



gross margin increased   113  to 157 billion  compared to 141 billion  in 2011  as a percent of sales gross margin increased   40  basis points to 336  for fiscal 2012  compared to 332  for fiscal 2011  these changes reflect improved direct product margin partially offset by increased transportation costs direct product margin increased as we continue to make progress on our four strategic margin initiatives which include inventory and markdown management strategic sourcing exclusive branding and price optimization transportation costs increased primarily as a result of higher fuel costs coupled with the continued mix shift to more freightintensive cue products we expect transportation costs to continue to rise as a result of higher planned import volume as a percent of total purchases as well as increased costs related to the continued mix shift to more freightintensive cue products however we expect that we will be able to mitigate these factors through effective sourcing of product and retail price management 

as a percent of sales sga expenses including depreciation and amortization improved   70  basis points to 242  in fiscal 2012  from 249  in fiscal 2011  this improvement was primarily attributable to the leverage of continued strong samestore sales expense control related to store operating costs and lower yearoveryear incentive compensation expense total sga expenses for fiscal 2012   increased   71  to 113 billion  from 105 billion  in fiscal 2011  the increase in sga primarily reflects new store growth as well as operating costs relating to our new franklin kentucky distribution center which became operational in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 offset in part by the favorable impact of one less week in fiscal 2012  compared to fiscal 2011  as part of the companys 53week calendar in the prior year 

our effective tax rate increased  to 366  for fiscal 2012  compared to 365  in fiscal 2011  the change in the effective tax rate was principally due to a reduction in the benefit provided by certain federal tax credits during fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 

as a result of the foregoing factors net income for fiscal 2012   increased   241  to 2765 million  or 380  per diluted share as compared to net income of 2227 million  or 301  per diluted share in fiscal 2011  

during fiscal 2012  we repurchased approximately 31 million  shares of the companys common stock at a total cost of 2718 million  as part of our previously announced 1 billion  share repurchase program in fiscal 2011  we repurchased approximately 31 million  shares at a total cost of 1800 million  

fiscal 2011  compared to fiscal 2010   

net sales increased 163 to 423 billion in fiscal 2011 from 364 billion in fiscal 2010 fiscal 2011 included an additional week compared to fiscal 2010 representing approximately 170 basis points of the net sales increase samestore sales for fiscal 2011 were 399 billion an 82 increase over fiscal 2010 this compares to a 70 samestore sales increase in the prior year the samestore transaction count increased 50 while samestore average ticket increased 31 for fiscal 2011 the samestore sales increase was driven by strong results in cue products principally animal and petrelated merchandise emergency response related merchandise also performed well during the year as a result of hurricane irene and tornadoes across the southeast we estimate that samestore sales were favorably impacted by approximately 340 basis points due to inflation principally in key cue categories additionally fiscal 2011 had one additional comp sales day in the year which had a favorable impact on samestore sales of approximately 30 basis points 

in addition to samestore sales growth in fiscal 2011 sales from new stores and stores opened less than one year were 2375 million in fiscal 2011 which represented 64 percentage points of the 163 increase over fiscal 2010 net sales 

the following chart summarizes our store growth during fiscal 2011  and 2010  



the following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2011 and 2010 



gross margin increased 169 to 141 billion compared to 120 billion in 2010 as a percent of sales gross margin increased 10 basis points to 332 for fiscal 2011 compared to 331 for fiscal 2010 the increase in gross margin reflects improved direct product margin partially offset by increased transportation costs direct product margin increased as we continued to make progress on our four strategic margin initiatives which include inventory management strategic sourcing exclusive branding and price optimization 

as a percent of sales sga expenses including depreciation and amortization improved 90 basis points to 249 in fiscal 2011 from 258 in fiscal 2010 this change was primarily attributable to the leverage of strong samestore sales and expense control with respect to store operating costs total sga expenses for fiscal 2011 increased 125 to 105 billion from 9374 million in fiscal 2010 the increase in sga expense primarily reflects new store growth variable costs associated with our samestore sales performance increased advertising for print media and special promotional events and expansion of our distribution center capacity and ongoing implementation of the new warehouse management system the company’s new franklin kentucky distribution center opened in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 

our effective tax rate decreased to 365 for fiscal 2011 compared to 366 in fiscal 2010 this reduction in the effective tax rate resulted from the favorable impact of certain federal tax credits as well as the utilization of various state income tax credits during fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

as a result of the foregoing factors net income for fiscal 2011 increased 326 to 2227 million or 301 per diluted share as compared to net income of 1680 million or 225 per diluted share in fiscal 2010 

during fiscal 2011 we repurchased approximately 31 million shares of stock at a total cost of 1800 million as part of our previously announced 1 billion share repurchase program in fiscal 2010 we repurchased approximately 08 million shares at a total cost of 382 million 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

in addition to normal operating expenses our primary ongoing cash requirements are for new store expansion remodeling and relocation programs including inventory purchases and capital expenditures distribution center and store support center capacity and improvements information technology share repurchases and cash dividends our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are existing cash balances funds provided from operations borrowings available under our senior credit facility capital and operating leases and normal trade credit our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the spring and coldweather selling seasons respectively 

working capital 

at december 29 2012  we had working capital of 5695 million  which decreased   601 million  from december 31 2011  this change was attributable to the following components of current assets and current liabilities in millions 



working capital at december 29 2012  was impacted most significantly by changes in our cash inventory accounts payable and income taxes payable 

 

borrowings and credit facilities 

the senior credit facility provides for borrowings of up to 250 million  with sublimits of 250 million  and 20 million  for letters of credit and swingline loans respectively this agreement is unsecured and matures in october 2016  with proceeds available to be used for working capital capital expenditures dividends share repurchases and other matters 

at december 29 2012  and december 31 2011  there were no outstanding borrowings under the senior credit facility there were 514 million  and 150 million  outstanding letters of credit as of december 29 2012  and december 31 2011  respectively borrowings bear interest at either the bank’s base rate  325  at december 29 2012  or the london interbank offer rate “libor”  021  at december 29 2012  plus an additional amount ranging from 040  to 100  per annum adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio  050  at december 29 2012  we are also required to pay quarterly in arrears a commitment fee for unused capacity ranging from 008  to 020  per annum and adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio  010  at december 29 2012  there are no compensating balance requirements associated with the senior credit facility 

the senior credit facility requires quarterly compliance with respect to two material covenants a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio the fixed charge coverage ratio compares earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization stock compensation and rent expense “consolidated ebitdar” to the sum of interest paid and rental expense excluding any straightline rent adjustments the leverage ratio compares total debt plus rental expense excluding any straightline rent adjustments multiplied by a factor of six to consolidated ebitdar the senior credit facility also contains certain other restrictions regarding 

additional indebtedness capital expenditures business operations guarantees investments mergers consolidations and sales of assets transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates and liens we were in compliance with all covenants at december 29 2012  

sources and uses of cash 

our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures while uses of cash for financing activities are repurchase of the company’s common stock and payment of common stock dividends the following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years in millions 



operating activities 

cash flow from operating activities continues to provide the primary source of our liquidity the 1242 million   increase  in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2012  over fiscal 2011  was primarily due to stronger earnings working capital management and the timing of tax payments as shown below in millions 



the change in deferred income taxes is due primarily to temporary differences related to tax law changes regarding depreciation inventory net of accounts payable increased at a lesser rate compared to prior year as we achieved a higher increase in accounts payable relative to inventory primarily due to timing of payments income taxes payable increased due to higher income in the period as well as timing of estimated tax payments as a result of changes in allowable deductions for depreciation expense 

the 315 million  increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2011  over fiscal 2010  is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities in millions 



the increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to stronger net income and the impact of higher depreciation and amortization expense partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by accrued expenses and an increase in cash used for prepaid expenses and other current assets the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is related to store growth and capital expenditures associated with the construction of a new distribution center the decrease in cash provided by accrued expenses was primarily due to timing of payments the increase in cash used for prepaid expenses and other current assets is primarily due to timing of payments due from our vendors 

investing activities 

investing activities used cash of 1391 million  1713 million  and 1121 million  in fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively the majority of this cash requirement relates to our capital expenditures in fiscal 2012  the 1529 million  of capital expenditures was partially offset by a 135 million  decrease in restricted cash our significant store expansion coupled with distribution network and store support center expansion and other required investments in infrastructure resulted in the following capital expenditures in millions 



the above table reflects 93  new stores and one  relocation during fiscal 2012  compared to 85  new stores and three  relocations during fiscal 2011  we also purchased five of our existing leased stores during fiscal 2012  compared to 12 existing leased stores in fiscal 2011  the capital expenditures in fiscal 2012  for distribution center capacity and improvements primarily reflect the construction of our new distribution center in macon georgia which we expect to be operational in late 2013 the increase in expenditures for information technology in fiscal 2012  is related to pointofsale system and ecommerce site upgrades as well as store and store support center hardware refreshes the increase in corporate and other primarily reflects the purchase of an undeveloped parcel of land in brentwood tennessee for our future store support center the spending in fiscal 2011 for distribution center capacity is primarily due to the construction of our distribution center in franklin kentucky and the implementation of a new warehouse management system in two of our seven distribution centers 

  

we currently estimate that capital expenditures will range between 240 million and 250 million in fiscal 2013  

 31 

 

financing activities 

financing activities used cash of 2775 million 1632 million  and 260 million  in fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively the cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2012  was mainly the result of repurchases of common stock and quarterly cash dividends paid to stockholders partially offset by net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to sharebased compensation and excess tax benefits recognized on options exercised 

our board of directors authorized share repurchases under the share repurchase program up to 10 billion  of common stock exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses related to such repurchases through april 2015  the repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions the timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors including price corporate and regulatory requirements capital availability and other market conditions repurchased shares will be held in treasury the program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice 

we repurchased approximately 31 million  31 million  and 08 million  shares under the share repurchase program at a total cost of 2718 million  1800 million  and 382 million  in fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance as of december 29 2012  we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of 2912 million  exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses 

in the second quarter of fiscal 2012 we increased our quarterly dividend from 012 per share to 020 per share we paid dividends totaling 513 million  309 million  and 204 million  in fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively 

we believe that our existing cash balances expected cash flow from future operations borrowings available under the senior credit facility operating and capital leases and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs including new store openings store acquisitions relocations and renovations and distribution center capacity over the next several years 

significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of december 29 2012 in thousands 



a capital lease obligations include related interest 

b relates to the obligation to purchase a previously leased store 

c reflects 31 million  for the land and construction of stores expected to be opened in fiscal 2013 244 million  for construction of our distribution center in macon georgia and 11 million  for development of our new store support center   in addition in january 2013 we signed a contract related to the construction of our new store support center in the amount of 590 million 

at december 29 2012  there were 514 million  outstanding letters of credit under the senior credit facility and a 73 million  outstanding letter of credit at a financial institution outside of the senior credit facility which is collateralized by a time deposit classified as restricted cash 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements are limited to operating leases and outstanding letters of credit the balances for these arrangements are previously discussed we typically lease buildings for retail stores and offices rather than acquiring these assets which allows us to utilize financial capital to operate the business rather than invest in fixed assets letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory primarily sourced overseas in a timely manner and support certain risk management programs 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201105 “comprehensive income topic 220 presentation of comprehensive income” which provides new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income asu 201105 eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and instead requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements this guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2011 the company adopted the standard for the interim period ended march 31 2012 there are no items of other comprehensive income for the periods presented thus there was no impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

in september 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201108 “intangibles — goodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment” the asu gives an entity the option in its annual goodwill impairment test to first assess revised qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 that the fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying amount “qualitative assessment” if it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying amount an entity would not be required to perform the existing twostep impairment test the amendments to topic 350 are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 the company adopted the standard for the interim period ended march 31 2012 there was no impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 




 i tem 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we may be exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from the senior credit facility the senior credit facility bears interest at either the bank’s base rate  325  at both december 29 2012  and december 31 2011  or libor  021 and 030  at december 29 2012  and december 31 2011  respectively plus an additional amount per annum adjusted quarterly ranging from 040  to 100  based on our leverage ratio  050  at both december 29 2012  and december 31 2011  we are also required to pay quarterly in arrears a commitment fee ranging from 008  to 020  based on the daily average unused portion of the credit line  010  at both december 29 2012  and december 31 2011  

seasonality and weather 

our business is seasonal historically our sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products in past years extreme weather conditions including snow and ice storms flood and wind damage hurricanes tornadoes and droughts have also affected our sales and results of operations our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the impact of extreme weather conditions through geographic dispersion of our stores and taking advantage of our ability to effectively manage inventory allocation we experience our highest inventory and accounts payable levels during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal product in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the coldweather selling season 

purchase price volatility 

although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items steel grain petroleum corn cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services therefore we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost which may impact consumer demand and as a result sales and gross margin our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale from increased volume of purchases adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality should our strategy to mitigate purchase price volatility not be effective our financial performance could be adversely impacted

our products are sourced through both domestic and international vendors our business is not dependent upon any one vendor or particular group of vendors we purchase our products from a core group of approximately 700 vendors with no one vendor representing more than 10 of our purchases during fiscal 2011 approximately 275 vendors accounted for approximately 90 of our purchases during fiscal 2011 we have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative sources of supply for our products and we believe that adequate sources of supply exist at substantially similar costs for nearly all of our products we have no material longterm contractual commitments with any of our vendors 

we maintain a dedicated inventory management team to focus exclusively on all forecasting and replenishment functions this centralized direction permits our buying teams to focus more strategic attention toward vendor line reviews assortment planning and testing of new products and programs through the combined efforts of these teams we continue to improve our overall inventory productivity and instock position 

distribution 

we currently operate a distribution network for supplying our stores with merchandise and in fiscal 2011 our stores received approximately 70 of our merchandise through this network while approximately 30 of our merchandise is shipped direct to the store from our vendors our seven distribution centers are located in kentucky indiana georgia maryland texas nebraska and washington representing total distribution capacity of 37 million square feet in 2011 we completed construction of the 834000 square foot facility in kentucky which became operational during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 we continue to improve the technology in our distribution centers and currently two of our seven facilities are utilizing a new warehouse management system that provides for better movement of inventory through automation we will continue to refine this new system and expect that it will be implemented across the entire distribution network over the next few years 

we manage our inbound and outbound transportation activity inhouse through the use of a webbased transportation management system we utilize several common carriers for store deliveries we manage our transportation costs through carrier negotiations the monitoring of transportation routes and the scheduling of deliveries 

marketing 

we utilize an everyday value prices strategy to consistently offer our products at competitive prices complemented by strategically planned promotions throughout the year we regularly monitor prices at competing stores and adjust our prices as appropriate 

to generate store traffic and position ourselves as a destination store we promote broad selections of merchandise with newspaper circulars customer targeted direct mail and email and internet offerings vendors frequently support these specific programs by offering temporary cost reductions honoring coupons and funding gift card rebate programs our vendors also provide assistance with product presentation and fixture design brochures support for instore events and pointofpurchase materials for customer education and product knowledge for our team members 

  

  

multichannel 

we do business with our customers across multiple touch points including our stores website email and direct mail our goal is to be available when and how our customers choose to engage with our brand connecting with consumers online provides the opportunity to allow customers to shop at a time and place that fits their schedule while delivering enhanced product information research and decision tools that support product selection and informational needs in specific subject areas additionally we give our customers the ability to purchase products and have them shipped to one of our retail stores their homes or offices we believe this capability further enhances customer service and extends our market to areas where our retail stores are not currently located 

  

competition 

we operate in a competitive retail industry the principal competitive factors include location of stores price and quality of merchandise instock consistency merchandise assortment and presentation and customer service we compete with general merchandise retailers home center retailers specialty and discount retailers independently owned retail farm and ranch stores numerous privatelyheld regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives as well as internetbased retailers however we believe we have successfully differentiated ourselves from these entities by focusing on our specialized market niche for customers living the rural lifestyle 

management and team members 

as of december 31 2011 we employed approximately 8700 fulltime and approximately 7700 parttime team members we also employ additional parttime team members during peak periods we are not party to any collective bargaining agreements 

our store operations are organized into nine regions each region is led by a regional manager and the region is further organized into districts which are led by a district manager or area manager our regional managers district managers area managers store managers and other distribution and support personnel have contributed significantly to our performance we have internal advisory boards one comprised of store managers and the other comprised of district managers these groups bring a grassroots perspective to operational initiatives and generate chainwide endorsement of proposed “bestpractice” solutions

we encourage a “promote from within” environment when internal resources permit we also provide internal leadership development programs designed to mentor our high potential team members for continued progress and believe we have satisfactory relationships with our team members our district managers area managers and store managers have an average length of service of approximately six years management believes internal promotions coupled with the hiring of individuals with previous retail experience will provide the management structure necessary to support our planned store growth

growth strategy 

our current and longterm growth strategy is to 1 expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores 2 enhance financial performance through samestore sales growth achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an “everyday value prices” philosophy and supported by strong customer service 3 enhance product margin through strategic product sourcing and regional allocation a strong private label offering and optimization of product pricing transportation and distribution costs 4 leverage operating costs especially advertising distribution and corporate overhead by focusing on opportunities for continuous improvement and elimination of waste in all of our processes 5 expand market opportunities via internet sales accomplished by improving our product content and enhancing our customers’ online experience and 6 expand through selective acquisition as such opportunities arise to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complementary strategy to organic growth 

over the past five years we have experienced considerable sales growth with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 123 we plan to open 90 to 95 new stores in 2012 a selling square footage increase of approximately 80 we opened 85 new stores in 2011 and 74 new stores in 2010 a square footage increase of approximately 78 and 74 respectively 

we operated 1085 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states as of december 31 2011 given the size of the communities that we target we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in many existing and new markets we have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 1000 additional markets for new tractor supply stores inclusive of recently identified small market locations approximately 55 of our stores are in freestanding buildings and 45 are located in strip shopping centers we lease approximately 93 of our store sites and own the remaining 7 of store sites

 item 1a  risk factors 

our business faces many risks those risks of which we are currently aware and deem to be material are described below if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur our business financial condition or results of operations may significantly suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this form 10k 

general economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance 

our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending including discretionary spending economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels business conditions interest rates tax rates fuel and energy costs higher labor and healthcare costs the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to lowerpriced competitors a general reduction in the level of discretionary spending or shifts in consumer discretionary spending to our competitors could adversely affect our growth and profitability additionally changes in the mix of products sold to a mix with a lower overall gross margin or other increased cost of sales along with slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory could adversely affect our operations and operating results 

purchase price volatility including inflationary and deflationary pressures may adversely affect our financial performance 

although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items steel grain petroleum corn cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services therefore we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost which may impact consumer demand and as a result sales and gross margin our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale from increased volume of purchases adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality due to the competitive environment such conditions could adversely impact our financial performance 

we may be unable to increase sales at our existing stores 

we experience fluctuations in our samestore sales which are defined as stores which have completed twelve months of sales our success depends in part upon our ability to improve sales at our existing stores various factors affect samestore sales including the general retail sales environment our ability to efficiently source and distribute products changes in our merchandise mix competition current economic conditions the timing of release of new merchandise and promotional events the success of marketing programs and weather conditions these factors may cause our samestore sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations past samestore sales are not necessarily an indication of future results and there can be no assurance that our samestore sales will not decrease in the future 

our failure to effectively manage growth could impair our business 

even if we are able to implement to a significant degree our key business strategy of expanding our store base we may experience managerial or operational problems which may prevent any expected increase in profitability or negatively impact our cash flow to manage our planned expansion we must ensure the continuing adequacy of our existing systems controls and procedures including product distribution facilities store management financial controls and information systems there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our planned expansion that the new stores will be effectively integrated into our existing operations or that such stores will be profitable 

  

  

capital requirements for growth may not be available 

the construction and opening or acquisition of new stores and distribution facilities along with the remodeling and renovation of existing stores require significant amounts of capital in the past our growth has been funded primarily through bank borrowings and internally generated cash flow disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the ability of the banks to meet their commitments our access to funds under the credit facility is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time in addition tighter lending practices have made it more challenging for our real estate developers to obtain financing under reasonable loan terms and conditions unfavorable lending trends could impact the timing of our store openings and materially adversely affect our ability to open new builttosuit stores in desirable locations 

longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty changing or increased regulation reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases cash dividends or other discretionary uses of cash 

failure to open new stores in the manner and number currently contemplated could adversely affect our financial performance 

an integral part of our business strategy includes the expansion of our base of stores by opening new stores this expansion strategy is dependent on our ability to find suitable locations and we face competition from many retailers for such sites if we are unable to implement this strategy our ability to increase our sales profitability and cash flow could be impaired significantly to the extent that we are unable to open new stores in the manner we anticipate due to among other reasons site approval or unforeseen delays in construction our sales growth may be impeded 

there can be no assurance that our new store openings will be successful or result in greater sales and profitability for the company new stores build their sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection over time and as a result generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales than our more mature stores as we continue to open new stores there may be a negative impact on our results from a lower contribution margin of these new stores until their sales levels ramp to chain average if at all as well as from the impact of related preopening costs 

competition in our industry may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations 

we operate in a very competitive market the principal competitive factors include location of stores price and quality of merchandise instock consistency merchandise assortment and presentation and customer service we believe we have successfully differentiated ourselves from general merchandise retailers home center retailers and other specialty and discount retailers by focusing on our specialized market niche however we do face competition from these entities as well as competition from independentlyowned retail farm and ranch stores privatelyheld regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives 

weather conditions may have a significant impact on our financial results 

historically weather conditions have had a significant impact on our operating results weather conditions affect the demand for and in some cases the supply of products which in turn has an impact on prices in past years we have experienced extreme weather conditions including snow and ice storms flood and wind damage hurricanes tornadoes and droughts in some states weather conditions also directly affect the demand for seasonal products particularly during the winter heating season accordingly the weather can have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our merchandising initiatives and marketing emphasis may not provide expected results 

we believe our past performance has been based on and future success will depend upon in part the ability to develop and execute merchandising initiatives with effective marketing there is no assurance that we will be successful or that new initiatives will be executed in a timely manner to satisfy our customers’ needs or expectations failure to execute and promote such initiatives in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow the business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition additionally our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demand and preferences for merchandise if we misjudge the market we may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to take significant inventory markdowns shortages of key items could also have a materially adverse impact on operating results 

we face risks associated with vendors from whom our products are sourced 

the products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors as a general rule we have agreements with our vendors in which the vendors agree to comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and to indemnify us against certain liabilities and costs our ability to recover liabilities and costs under these vendor agreements is dependent upon the financial condition and integrity of the vendors 

  

  

we rely on foreign manufacturers for various products that we sell in addition many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources we rely on longterm relationships with our suppliers but have no longterm contracts with such suppliers our future success will depend in large measure upon our ability to maintain our existing supplier relationships or to develop new ones this reliance increases the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various products due to local political economic social or environmental conditions transportation delays restrictive actions by foreign governments or changes in united states laws and regulations affecting imports or domestic distribution our vendors may be forced to reduce their production shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection which could make it difficult for us to serve the market’s needs and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

as an importer our business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business abroad such as foreign governmental regulations economic disruptions delays in shipments transportation capacity and costs currency exchange rates and changes in political or economic conditions in countries from which we purchase products if any such factors were to render the conduct of business in particular countries undesirable or impractical or if additional united states quotas duties taxes or other charges or restrictions were imposed upon the importation of our products in the future our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” which generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and the antibribery laws of other jurisdictions failure to comply with the fcpa could subject us to among other things penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our failure to attract and retain qualified team members could adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to continue expanding operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified team members our ability to meet labor needs while controlling wage and related labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force unemployment levels prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation if we are unable to locate attract or retain qualified personnel or if costs of labor or related costs increase significantly our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we may be subject to product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business 

our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business we maintain general liability and workers compensation insurance with selfinsured retention for each policy type and a deductible for each occurrence we also maintain umbrella limits above the primary general liability and product liability coverage in many cases we have indemnification rights against the manufacturers of the products and their products liability insurance our ability to recover under such insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject to the financial viability of the insurers and manufacturers and the specific allegations of a claim no assurance can be given that our insurance coverage or the manufacturers’ indemnity will be available or sufficient in any claims brought against us 

our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in increased enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to environmental protection personal injury intellectual property consumer product safety building land use and zoning requirements workplace regulations wage and hour privacy and information security and employment law matters if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations or if these laws or regulations are violated by importers manufacturers or distributers we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

a privacy breach could result in negative publicity and adversely affect the company’s business 

the protection of customer employee and company data is critical to the company the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements in connection with credit card sales we transmit confidential credit card information third parties may have the technology or knowhow to breach the security of this customer information and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively preclude others from obtaining improper access to this information any security breach could expose us to risks of data loss litigation and liability and could seriously disrupt our operations and any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation 

  

  

in addition states and the federal government are increasingly enacting laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft we collect personal information from consumers in the course of doing business these laws will likely increase the costs of doing business and if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these new laws we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies which could harm our business 

if we experience difficulties with our management information systems our financial performance may be adversely affected 

we depend on management information systems for many aspects of our business we could be materially adversely affected if our management information systems are disrupted or if we are unable to improve upgrade maintain and expand systems particularly in light of the contemplated continued store growth 

if we are unable to secure or develop and implement sufficiently robust new technologies to deliver business process solutions within the appropriate time frame cost and functionality our strategic business initiatives that are dependent upon these technologies may not be successful 

the success of our strategic business initiatives designed to increase our sales and improve margin is dependent in varying degrees on the timely delivery and the functionality of information technology systems to support them extended delays or cost overruns in securing developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support the strategic business initiatives would delay and possibly even prevent us from realizing the projected benefits of those initiatives 

the implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail 

we have made and we plan to continue to make significant investments in our supply chain and technology these initiatives are designed to streamline our distribution process so that we can optimize the delivery of goods and services to our stores and distribution centers in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives including those associated with managing thirdparty service providers and employing new webbased tools and services could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term in addition our improved supply chain and new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the initiatives might fail altogether 

effective tax rate changes and results of examinations by taxing authorities could materially impact our results 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the earnings mix being lower than historical results in states where we have lower statutory rates and higher than historical results in states where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the internal revenue service irs and other state and local taxing authorities like many retailers a portion of our sales are to taxexempt customers the business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment these circumstances create risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance our results could be materially impacted by the determinations and expenses related to these and other proceedings by the irs and other state and local taxing authorities 

failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business and results 

the companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting an internal control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the market price of our common stock

we operated 1085 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states as of december 31 2011 given the size of the communities that we target we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in existing and new markets we have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 1000 additional markets for new tractor supply stores inclusive of recently identified small market locations approximately 55 of our stores are in freestanding buildings and 45 are located in strip shopping centers

over the past five years we have experienced considerable sales growth with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 123 we plan to open 90 to 95 new stores in 2012 a selling square footage increase of approximately 80 we opened 85 new stores in 2011 and 74 new stores in 2010 a square footage increase of approximately 78 and 74 respectively 

our current and longterm growth strategy is to 1 expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores 2 enhance financial performance through samestore sales growth achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an “everyday value prices” philosophy and supported by strong customer service 3 enhance product margin through strategic product sourcing and regional allocation a strong private label offering and optimization of product pricing transportation and distribution costs 4 leverage operating costs especially advertising distribution and corporate overhead by focusing on opportunities for continuous improvement and elimination of waste in all of our processes 5 expand market opportunities via internet sales accomplished by improving our product content and enhancing our customers’ online experience and 6 expand through selective acquisition as such opportunities arise to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complementary strategy to organic growth 

our store strategy features low initial capital expenditures limited maintenance capital and low occupancy and operating costs the average cash investment for new leased stores opened in 2011 was approximately 12 million a majority of the cash outlay was for initial acquisition of inventory and capital expenditures principally leasehold improvements fixtures and equipment and approximately 82000 for preopening costs our new stores are typically profitable in the first full year of operation and reach chain average in approximately five years 

our capital allocation strategy focuses first on capital expenditure requirements to support growth and invest in existing facilities and improved information technology processes and systems and promotes effective stockholder return through our share repurchase and dividend programs our capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 and 2010 were 1662 million and 965 million respectively we expect capital expenditures in 2012 to be approximately 160 million to 170 million as we continue to invest in new store growth existing stores distribution center capacity and information technology 

  

  

we place significant emphasis on our merchandising programs evaluating the sales and profitability of our products through detailed line reviews review of vendor performance measures and modification of the overall product offerings modifications of product offerings include increasing the quality and affordability of some items through strategic sourcing improving our private label offerings and ensuring we have the best product mix in our stores based on the regional needs of our customers we believe these efforts coupled with a strong marketing program and indepth product knowledge training of our store team members have enhanced our sales and financial performance 

  

significant accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our financial position andor results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 

  

  

 

 

  

  

 

 

  

  

 

 

  

  

 

 

  

  

 

  

  

quarterly financial data 

our unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2011 and 2010 are shown below in thousands except per share amounts 

 

 

  

  

results of operations 

our fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last saturday of the calendar year references to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ended the fiscal year ended december 31 2011 consisted of 53 weeks while fiscal years ended december 25 2010 and december 26 2009 contained 52 weeks 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales 

 

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

net sales increased 163 to 423 billion in fiscal 2011 from 364 billion in fiscal 2010 fiscal 2011 included an additional week compared to fiscal 2010 representing approximately 170 basis points of the net sales increase samestore sales for fiscal 2011 were 399 billion an 82 increase over fiscal 2010 this compares to a 70 samestore sales increase in the prior year the samestore transaction count increased 50 while samestore average ticket increased 31 for fiscal 2011 the samestore sales increase was driven by continued strong results in core consumable usable and edible cue products principally animal and petrelated merchandise emergency response related merchandise also performed well during the year as a result of hurricane irene and tornadoes across the southeast we estimate that samestore sales were favorably impacted by approximately 340 basis points due to inflation principally in key cue categories additionally fiscal 2011 had one additional comp sales day in the year which had a favorable impact on samestore sales of approximately 30 basis points 

store growth was approximately 84 a net increase of 84 stores since december 25 2010 noncomp sales defined as stores opened less than one year for fiscal 2011 were 2375 million a 64 increase over total fiscal 2010 net sales noncomp sales for fiscal 2010 were 2054 million a 65 increase over total fiscal 2009 net sales 

in fiscal 2011 we opened 85 new stores compared to 74 new stores in fiscal 2010 relocated three stores compared to no relocations in fiscal 2010 and closed one store compared to three closed stores in fiscal 2010 

the following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2011 and 2010 

 

  

  

gross margin increased 169 to 141 billion compared to 120 billion in 2010 as a percent of sales gross margin increased 10 basis points to 332 for fiscal 2011 compared to 331 for fiscal 2010 the increase in gross margin reflects improved direct product margin partially offset by increased transportation costs direct product margin increased as we continue to make progress on our four strategic margin initiatives which include inventory management strategic sourcing private branding and price optimization we expect the effects of inflation to continue into and potentially throughout the remainder of fiscal 2012 additionally we expect transportation costs to continue to increase as a result of rising fuel costs and planned increases in our import volume as a percent of total purchases however we expect that we will be able to maintain reasonable margins through effective sourcing of product and retail price management 

as a percent of sales sga expenses including depreciation and amortization improved 90 basis points to 249 in fiscal 2011 from 258 in fiscal 2010 the sga improvement as a percent of sales for fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to the leverage of strong samestore sales and expense control with respect to store operating costs total sga expenses for fiscal 2011 increased 125 to 105 billion from 9374 million in fiscal 2010 the increase in sga expense primarily reflects new store growth variable costs associated with our samestore sales performance increased advertising for print media and special promotional events and expansion of our distribution center capacity and ongoing implementation of the new warehouse management system the company’s new franklin kentucky distribution center opened in the fourth quarter of 2011 

our effective tax rate decreased to 365 for fiscal 2011 compared to 366 in fiscal 2010 this reduction in the effective tax rate resulted from the favorable impact of certain federal tax credits as well as the utilization of various state income tax credits during fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

as a result of the foregoing factors net income for fiscal 2011 increased 326 to 2227 million or 301 per diluted share as compared to net income of 1680 million or 225 per diluted share in fiscal 2010 

during 2011 we repurchased approximately 31 million shares of stock at a total cost of 1800 million as part of our previously announced 1 billion share repurchase program in 2010 we repurchased approximately 08 million shares at a total cost of 382 million 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

net sales increased 135 to 364 billion in fiscal 2010 from 321 billion in fiscal 2009 samestore sales for fiscal 2010 were 343 billion a 70 increase over fiscal 2009 this compares to a 11 samestore sales decrease in the prior year the samestore transaction count increased 74 while samestore average ticket decreased 03 for fiscal 2010 the samestore sales increase was broadbased and driven by strong results in core consumable categories principally animal and petrelated products as well as seasonal products including heating insulated outerwear and outdoor power equipment 

new store growth was approximately 76 or 71 net stores opened since december 26 2009 noncomp sales for fiscal 2010 were 2054 million a 65 increase over total fiscal 2009 net sales noncomp sales for fiscal 2009 were 2307 million a 77 increase over total fiscal 2008 net sales 

in fiscal 2010 we opened 74 new stores compared to 76 new stores in fiscal 2009 relocated no stores compared to two relocations in fiscal 2009 and closed three stores compared to one closed store in fiscal 2009 

the following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2010 and 2009 

 

gross margin increased 155 to 120 billion compared to 104 billion in 2009 as a percent of sales gross margin increased 60 basis points to 331 for fiscal 2010 compared to 325 for fiscal 2009 the improvement in gross margin is primarily due to expanded direct product margin and a decrease in shrink partially offset by increased transportation costs the direct product margin improvement resulted from progress on certain margin driving initiatives which include strategic sourcing inventory management and more effective pricing 

  

  

as a percent of sales sga expenses including depreciation and amortization improved 70 basis points to 258 in fiscal 2010 from 265 in fiscal 2009 the sga improvement as a percent of sales was primarily attributable to the leverage of strong samestore sales and expense management partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation expense total sga expenses increased 102 to 9374 million from 8503 million in fiscal 2009 the increase in sga expense primarily reflects new store growth variable costs associated with our samestore sales growth and increased incentive compensation 

our effective tax rate decreased to 366 for fiscal 2010 compared to 369 in fiscal 2009 this reduction in the effective tax rate resulted from a greater tax benefit received on the disqualified disposition of incentive stock options during fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

as a result of the foregoing factors net income for fiscal 2010 increased 403 to 1680 million or 225 per diluted share as compared to net income of 1197 million or 163 per diluted share in fiscal 2009 

during 2010 we repurchased approximately 08 million shares of stock at a total cost of 382 million as part of our previously announced share repurchase program in 2009 we repurchased approximately 04 million shares at a total cost of 153 million 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

in addition to normal operating expenses our primary ongoing cash requirements are for new store expansion remodeling and relocation programs including inventory purchases and capital expenditures distribution center capacity and improvements information technology share repurchases and cash dividends our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are existing cash balances funds provided from operations borrowings available under our revolving credit agreement capital and operating leases and normal trade credit our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the spring and coldweather selling seasons respectively 

working capital 

at december 31 2011 we had working capital of 6296 million a 125 million increase from december 25 2010 this increase was primarily attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities in millions 

 

in comparison to prior yearend working capital increased primarily as a result of an increase in inventory partially offset by a decrease in cash the increase in inventory was primarily due to new store growth and inflation average inventory per store increased to 723000 for fiscal 2011 compared to 709000 for fiscal 2010 the decrease in cash is primarily attributable to an increased volume of share repurchases as well as an increase in capital expenditures principally due to the construction of a new distribution center 

  

  

borrowings and credit facilities 

through october 23 2011 we were party to a senior credit facility the “credit agreement” which provided for borrowings up to 350 million with sublimits of 75 million and 20 million for letters of credit and swingline loans respectively with proceeds available to be used for working capital capital expenditures dividends share repurchases and other matters the credit agreement had an increase option for 150 million subject to additional lender group commitments the credit agreement was unsecured and would have matured in february 2012 

on october 24 2011 we entered into a new senior credit facility with largely the same lender group as under the previous credit agreement the new senior credit facility provides for borrowings of up to 250 million with sublimits of 250 million and 20 million for letters of credit and swingline loans respectively this agreement is unsecured and matures in october 2016 with proceeds available to be used for working capital capital expenditures dividends share repurchases and other matters 

at december 31 2011 and december 25 2010 there were no outstanding borrowings under either senior credit facility there were 150 million and 274 million outstanding letters of credit as of december 31 2011 and december 25 2010 respectively borrowings bear interest at either the bank’s base rate 325 at december 31 2011 or the london interbank offer rate “libor” 030 at december 31 2011 plus an additional amount ranging from 040 to 100 per annum adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio 050 at december 31 2011 we are also required to pay quarterly in arrears a commitment fee ranging from 008 to 020 per annum and adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio for unused capacity 010 at december 31 2011 there are no compensating balance requirements associated with the senior credit facility 

the senior credit facility requires quarterly compliance with respect to two material covenants a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio the fixed charge coverage ratio principally compares earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization stock compensation and rent expense “consolidated ebitdar” to the sum of interest paid and rental expense excluding straightline rent the leverage ratio principally compares total debt plus rental expense excluding straightline rent multiplied by a factor of six to consolidated ebitdar the senior credit facility also contains certain other restrictions regarding additional indebtedness capital expenditures business operations guarantees investments mergers consolidations and sales of assets transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates and liens we were in compliance with all covenants at december 31 2011 

sources and uses of cash 

our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures while uses of cash for financing activities are repurchase of the company’s common stock and payment of common stock dividends the following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years in millions 

 

operating activities 

the 315 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities in millions 

 

  

  

cash flow from operating activities continues to provide the primary source of our liquidity the increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to stronger net income and the impact of higher depreciation and amortization expense partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by accrued expenses and an increase in cash used for prepaids and other current assets the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is related to store growth and capital expenditures associated with the construction of a new distribution center the decrease in cash provided by accrued expenses was primarily due to timing of payments the increase in cash used for prepaids and other current assets is primarily due to timing of payments due from our vendors 

the 73 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities in millions 

 

the increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to stronger net income and an increase in cash provided by accrued expenses partially offset by an increase in cash used for inventory net of accounts payable and a decrease in cash provided by prepaids and other current assets continued store growth has resulted in increased inventory balances accounts payable levels have decreased as a result of more timely payments in order to capture payment discounts offered by vendors and also as a result of an increase in cash held in our bank concentration account the bank concentration account nets against the related book overdraft included in accounts payable the increase in cash provided by accrued expenses is a result of timing of payments as well as incentive compensation earned in fiscal 2010 but not paid until fiscal 2011 the decrease in cash provided by prepaids and other current assets is primarily due to timing of payments due from our vendors 

 

investing activities 

investing activities used 1713 million 1121 million and 738 million in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the majority of this cash requirement relates to our capital expenditures our significant store expansion coupled with distribution network expansion and other required investments in infrastructure resulted in the following capital expenditures in millions 

 

the above table reflects 85 new stores and three relocations in fiscal 2011 compared to 74 new stores during fiscal 2010 we also purchased 12 of our existing lease stores during fiscal 2011 compared to four existing stores in fiscal 2010 the increase in capital expenditures for distribution center capacity in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 is primarily due to the construction of a new distribution center in franklin kentucky and the implementation of a new warehouse management system in two of our seven distribution centers 

our longterm growth strategy anticipates continued geographic market expansion and further concentration within existing markets we currently estimate that capital expenditures will range between 160 million and 170 million in fiscal 2012 we plan to open approximately five to 10 more stores in fiscal 2012 compared to 2011 while we do not plan to open a new distribution center in fiscal 2012 we estimate to spend approximately 30 million on our distribution center network principally for the acquisition of a site to relocate our southeast distribution center as well as other improvements in the existing distribution centers such as conveyor systems and other infrastructure enhancements additionally we plan to invest approximately 30 million in information technology upgrades including pointofsale system enhancements continued rollout of the new warehouse management system to distribution centers an upgrade of our ecommerce site and store and store support center hardware refreshes 

  

financing activities 

financing activities used 1632 million 260 million and 56 million in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2011 was mainly the result of repurchases of common stock and quarterly cash dividends paid to stockholders partially offset by increased net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to sharebased compensation 

on april 28 2011 the company’s board of directors authorized a 600 million increase to the existing share repurchase program bringing the total amount authorized to date under the program to an aggregate of 1 billion of common stock exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses related to such repurchases through april 2015 the repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions the timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors including price corporate and regulatory requirements capital availability and other market conditions repurchased shares will be held in treasury the program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice 

we repurchased approximately 31 million 08 million and 04 million shares under the share repurchase program at a total cost of 1800 million 382 million and 153 million in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance as of december 31 2011 we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of 5629 million exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses 

in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 we increased our quarterly dividend from 007 per share to 012 per share we paid dividends totaling 309 million and 204 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively 

we believe that our existing cash balances expected cash flow from future operations borrowings available under the senior credit facility operating and capital leases and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs including new store openings store acquisitions relocations and renovations and distribution center capacity over the next several years 

significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of december 31 2011 in thousands 

 

 

 

at december 31 2011 there were 150 million outstanding letters of credit under the senior credit facility and a 209 million outstanding letter of credit at a financial institution outside of the senior credit facility which is collateralized by a time deposit classified as restricted cash the letter of credit outside the senior credit facility will automatically increase by 10 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 bringing the total outstanding letter of credit balance to 219 million 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements are limited to operating leases and outstanding letters of credit the balances for these arrangements are discussed above we typically lease buildings for retail stores and offices rather than acquiring these assets which allows us to utilize financial capital to operate the business rather than invest in fixed assets letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory primarily sourced overseas in a timely manner and support certain risk management programs 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

in september 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201108 “intangibles — goodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment” the asu gives an entity the option in its annual goodwill impairment test to first assess revised qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount “qualitative assessment” if it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying amount an entity would not be required to perform the existing twostep impairment test the amendments to topic 350 are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 the company does not believe the adoption of asu 201108 will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 




 i tem 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we may be exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from the senior credit facility the senior credit facility bears interest at either the bank’s base rate 325 at both december 31 2011 and december 25 2010 or libor 030 and 026 at december 31 2011 and december 25 2010 respectively plus an additional amount per annum adjusted quarterly ranging from 040 to 100 at december 31 2011 and 035 to 090 at december 25 2010 based on our leverage ratio 050 and 040 at december 31 2011 and december 25 2010 respectively we are also required to pay quarterly in arrears a commitment fee ranging from 008 to 020 at december 31 2011 and 006 to 018 at december 25 2010 based on the daily average unused portion of the credit line 010 at december 31 2011 and 008 december 25 2010 

seasonality and weather 

our business is highly seasonal historically our sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products unseasonable weather excessive precipitation drought and early or late frosts may also affect our sales we believe however that the impact of extreme weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of our stores and our ability to effectively manage inventory allocation 

we experience our highest inventory and accounts payable levels during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal product in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the coldweather selling season 

purchase price volatility 

although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items steel grain petroleum corn cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services therefore we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost which may impact consumer demand and as a result sales and gross margin our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale from increased volume of purchases adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality due to the competitive environment such conditions could adversely impact our financial performance

purchasing 

we offer a differentiated assortment of products that are sourced through domestic and international vendors for those seeking to enjoy the “ out here ” lifestyle our business is not dependent upon any one vendor or particular group of vendors we purchase our products from a core group of approximately 700 vendors with no one vendor representing more than 10 of our purchases during fiscal 2010 approximately 250 vendors accounted for approximately 90 of our purchases during fiscal 2010 we have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative sources of supply for our products and we believe that adequate sources of supply exist at substantially similar costs for nearly all of our products we have no material longterm contractual commitments with any of our vendors 

we maintain a dedicated inventory management team to focus exclusively on all forecasting and replenishment functions this centralized direction permits our buying teams to focus more strategic attention toward vendor line reviews assortment planning and testing of new products and programs through the combined efforts of these teams we have improved our overall inventory productivity and instock position 

over 98 of our purchase orders are transmitted through an electronic data interchange edi system and approximately 95 of merchandise vendor invoices are transmitted through edi we are expanding the percentage of vendors who electronically transmit invoices and increasing the amount of sales history transmitted 

distribution 

we currently operate a distribution network for supplying our stores with merchandise and in fiscal 2010 our stores received approximately 67 of our merchandise through this network our six distribution centers are located in indiana georgia maryland texas nebraska and washington representing total distribution capacity of 29 million square feet in 2011 we have begun construction on our seventh distribution center a new 834000 square foot facility in kentucky to be operational during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 

we manage our inbound and outbound transportation activity inhouse through the use of a webbased transportation management system we utilize several common carriers for store deliveries we manage our transportation costs through carrier negotiations the monitoring of transportation routes and the scheduling of deliveries

we utilize an everyday value prices strategy to consistently offer our products at competitive prices complemented by promotions primarily implemented during peak selling seasons we regularly monitor prices at competing stores and adjust our prices as appropriate 

to generate store traffic and position ourselves as a destination store we promote broad selections of merchandise with newspaper circulars customer targeted direct mail and internet offerings vendors frequently support these specific programs by offering temporary cost reductions honoring coupons and funding gift card rebate programs 

  

  

due to the relatively small size of our stores increased traffic in the store ensures increased exposure to our products our vendors are committed to helping us promote our brand and position ourselves as a destination store our vendors provide assistance with product presentation and rack design brochures pointofpurchase materials for customers’ education and product education for our team members we also receive funding through contributions and incentives on purchases to promote new stores and earn rebates from vendors on product purchases based on volume 

  

competition 

we operate in a competitive retail industry the principal competitive factors include location of stores price and quality of merchandise instock consistency merchandise assortment and presentation and customer service we compete with general merchandise retailers home center retailers and other specialty and discount retailers as well as independently owned retail farm and ranch stores numerous privatelyheld regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives some of these competitors are units of national or regional chains and may have substantially greater resources and financial capacities than we do however we believe we have successfully differentiated ourselves from these entities by focusing on our specialized market niche for customers living the rural lifestyle 

management and team members 

as of december 25 2010 we employed approximately 7900 fulltime and approximately 6800 parttime team members we also employ additional parttime team members during peak periods we are not party to any collective bargaining agreements

 item 1a  risk factors 

our business faces many risks those risks which we are currently aware and we deem to be material are described below if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur our business financial condition or results of operations may significantly suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this form 10k 

general economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance 

our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending including discretionary spending economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels business conditions interest rates tax rates fuel and energy costs higher labor and healthcare costs the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to lowerpriced competitors a general reduction in the level of discretionary spending or shifts in consumer discretionary spending to our competitors could adversely affect our growth and profitability additionally changes in the mix of products sold to a mix with a lower overall gross margin or other increased cost of sales along with slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory could adversely affect our operations and operating results 

  

  

purchase price volatility including inflationary and deflationary pressures may adversely affect our financial performance 

although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items steel grain petroleum corn soybean and other commodities as well as transportation services therefore we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost which may impact consumer demand and as a result sales and gross margin our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale from increased volume of purchases adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality due to the competitive environment such conditions have and may continue to adversely impact our financial performance 

  

there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to increase sales at our existing stores 

we experience fluctuations in our samestore sales which are defined as stores which have completed twelve months of sales our success depends in part upon our ability to improve sales at our existing stores various factors affect samestore sales including the general retail sales environment our ability to efficiently source and distribute products changes in our merchandise mix competition current economic conditions the timing of release of new merchandise and promotional events the success of marketing programs and weather conditions these factors may cause our samestore sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations past samestore sales are not necessarily an indication of future results and there can be no assurance that our samestore sales will not decrease in the future 

even if we are able to implement to a significant degree our key business strategy of expanding our store base we may experience managerial or operational problems which may prevent any expected increase in profitability or negatively impact our cash flow to manage our planned expansion we must ensure the continuing adequacy of our existing systems controls and procedures including product distribution facilities store management financial controls and information systems there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our planned expansion that the new stores will be effectively integrated into our existing operations or that such stores will be profitable 

capital requirements for growth may not be available 

the construction and opening or acquisition of new stores and the development of new production and distribution facilities along with the remodeling and renovation of existing stores require significant amounts of capital in the past our growth has been funded primarily through bank borrowings and internally generated cash flow 

disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the ability of the banks to meet their commitments our access to funds under the credit facility is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time in addition tighter lending practices have made it more challenging for our real estate developers to obtain financing under reasonable loan terms and conditions unfavorable lending trends could impact the timing of our store openings and materially adversely affect our ability to open new purposebuilt stores in desirable locations 

longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty changing or increased regulation reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases or other discretionary uses of cash 

failure to open new stores in the manner currently contemplated could adversely affect our financial performance 

an integral part of our business strategy includes the expansion of our base of stores by opening new stores this expansion strategy is dependent on our ability to find suitable locations and we face competition from many retailers for such sites if we are unable to implement this strategy our ability to increase our sales profitability and cash flow could be impaired significantly to the extent that we are unable to open new stores in the manner we anticipate due to among other reasons site approval or unforeseen delays in construction our sales growth may be impeded 

new stores may negatively impact our results 

there can be no assurance that our new store openings will be successful or result in greater sales and profitability for the company new stores build their sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection over time and as a result generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales than our more mature stores as we continue to open new stores there may be a negative impact on our results from a lower contribution margin of these new stores until their sales levels ramp to chain average if at all as well as from the impact of related preopening costs 

competition in our industry may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations 

we operate in a very competitive market the principal competitive factors include location of stores price and quality of merchandise instock consistency merchandise assortment and presentation and customer service we believe we have successfully differentiated ourselves from general merchandise retailers home center retailers and other specialty and discount retailers by focusing on our specialized market niche however we do face competition from these entities as well as competition from independentlyowned retail farm and ranch stores privatelyheld regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives some of our competitors are units of national or regional chains that have substantially greater financial and other resources 

weather conditions may have a significant impact on our financial results 

historically weather conditions have had a significant impact on our operating results weather conditions affect the demand for and in some cases the supply of products which in turn has an impact on prices in past years we have experienced extreme weather conditions including snow and ice storms flood and wind damage hurricanes tornadoes and droughts in some states weather conditions also directly affect the demand for seasonal products particularly during the winter heating season accordingly the weather can have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

there are certain risks associated with the seasonal nature of our business 

our working capital needs and borrowings if necessary generally peak in our first and third fiscal quarters because lower sales are generated while expenses are incurred and inventory is increased in preparation for the spring and winter selling seasons if cash on hand and borrowings under existing credit facilities are insufficient to meet the seasonal needs or if cash flow generated during the spring and winter is insufficient to repay associated borrowings on a timely basis this seasonality could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

  

  

there is no assurance that our merchandising initiatives and marketing emphasis will provide expected results 

we believe our past performance has been based on and future success will depend upon in part the ability to develop and execute merchandising initiatives with effective marketing there is no assurance that we will be successful or that new initiatives will be executed in a timely manner to satisfy our customers’ needs or expectations failure to execute and promote such initiatives in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow the business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition additionally our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demand and preferences for merchandise if we misjudge the market we may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to take significant inventory markdowns shortages of key items could also have a materially adverse impact on operating results 

  

we face risks associated with vendors from whom our products are sourced 

the products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors as a general rule we have agreements with our vendors in which the vendors agree to comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and to indemnify us against certain liabilities and costs our ability to recover liabilities and costs under these vendor agreements is dependent upon the financial condition and integrity of the vendors 

we rely on foreign manufacturers for various products that we sell in addition many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources we rely on longterm relationships with our suppliers but have no longterm contracts with such suppliers our future success will depend in large measure upon our ability to maintain our existing supplier relationships or to develop new ones this reliance increases the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various products due to local political economic social or environmental conditions transportation delays restrictive actions by foreign governments or changes in united states laws and regulations affecting imports or domestic distribution our vendors may be forced to reduce their production shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection which in some cases would make it difficult for us to serve the market’s needs and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

as an importer our business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business abroad such as foreign governmental regulations economic disruptions delays in shipments transportation capacity and costs currency exchange rates and changes in political or economic conditions in countries from which we purchase products if any such factors were to render the conduct of business in particular countries undesirable or impractical or if additional united states quotas duties taxes or other charges or restrictions were imposed upon the importation of our products in the future our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

  

our failure to attract and retain qualified team members could adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to continue expanding operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified team members our ability to meet labor needs while controlling wage and related labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force unemployment levels prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation if we are unable to locate attract or retain qualified personnel or if costs of labor or related costs increase significantly our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we may be subject to product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business 

our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business we maintain general liability insurance with a deductible for each occurrence and a 36000000 aggregate retention applicable to all general liability and workers compensation claims we also maintain umbrella limits above the primary general liability and product liability cover in many cases we have indemnification rights against the manufacturers of the products and their products liability insurance our ability to recover under such insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject to the financial viability of the insurers and manufacturers and the specific allegations of a claim no assurance can be given that our insurance coverage or the manufacturers’ indemnity will be available or sufficient in any claims brought against us 

our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in federal state or local regulations 

changes in the federal state or local minimum wage or living wage requirements or changes in other wage or workplace regulations could increase our costs of doing business in addition changes in federal state or local regulations governing the sale of some of our products or tax regulations could increase our costs of doing business 

because we are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to environmental protection consumer product safety building land use and zoning requirements workplace regulations wage and hour privacy and information security and employment law matters if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations or if these laws or regulations are violated by importers manufacturers or distributers we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

a privacy breach could result in negative publicity and adversely affect the company’s business 

the protection of customer employee and company data is critical to the company the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements in connection with credit card sales we transmit confidential credit card information third parties may have the technology or knowhow to breach the security of this customer information and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively preclude others from obtaining improper access to this information any security breach could expose us to risks of data loss litigation and liability and could seriously disrupt our operations and any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation 

in addition states and the federal government are increasingly enacting laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft we collect personal information from consumers in the course of doing business these laws will likely increase the costs of doing business and if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these new laws we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies which could harm our business 

legal proceedings could materially impact our results 

from time to time we are party to legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and employment issues personal injury intellectual property and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business our results could be materially impacted by the decisions and expenses related to pending or future proceedings 

  

  

if we experience difficulties with our management information systems our financial performance may be adversely affected 

we depend on management information systems for many aspects of our business we could be materially adversely affected if our management information systems are disrupted or if we are unable to improve upgrade maintain and expand systems particularly in light of the contemplated continued store growth many of our information systems contain confidential customer company or employee data if we fail to adequately restrict access to this information our results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

effective tax rate changes and results of examinations by taxing authorities could materially impact our results 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the earnings mix being lower than historical results in states where we have lower statutory rates and higher than historical results in states where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the internal revenue service irs and other state and local taxing authorities a portion of our sales are to taxexempt customers the business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment these circumstances create risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance our results could be materially impacted by the determinations and expenses related to these and other proceedings by the irs and other state and local taxing authorities 

failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business and results 

the companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting an internal control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition asset impairment inventories lease obligations selfinsurance tax matters and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates or judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition

 item 3  legal proceedings 

the company received and responded to a request for information from the united states environmental protection agency “epa” relating to certain recreational vehicles and nonroad spark ignition engines sold by the company in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 the environmental enforcement section of the department of justice “doj” on behalf of the epa informed the company that it believed the company had violated the clean air act by importing or causing the importation of certain engines not covered by certificates of conformity issued by the epa and that unless the doj and the company were able to reach a settlement the doj was prepared to commence a civil action the company is currently engaged in settlement discussions with the doj that would call for the payment of a civil penalty and certain injunctive relief the engines were purchased by the company pursuant to agreements with vendors under which the vendors represented that their products complied with all applicable laws and regulations and under which the vendors agreed to indemnify the company for any liabilities or costs relating to among other matters the noncompliance or alleged noncompliance of their products the company has notified these vendors of the epa’s position and expects to be reimbursed for any liabilities or costs relating to this matter the company does not expect the resolution of this matter to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 

we are also involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business we expect these matters will be resolved without material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations we believe that any estimated loss related to such matters has been adequately provided in accrued liabilities to the extent probable and reasonably estimable it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in circumstances relating to these proceedings

our tractor supply stores typically range in size from 15500 to 18500 square feet of inside selling space and additional outside selling space we use a standard 15500 square foot prototype for new purposebuilt locations for new stores located in existing buildings one of several layout formats is utilized 

our whollyowned subsidiary del’s operated 26 stores as of december 25 2010 in washington oregon idaho and hawaii del’s stores currently range in size from approximately 2000 to 6000 square feet of inside selling space plus additional outside and coveredsheltered selling space 

  

our current and longterm growth strategy is to 1 expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores 2 enhance financial performance through samestore sales increases achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an “everyday value prices” philosophy and supported by strong customer service 3 enhance product margin through assortment management vendor management sourcing and optimization of transportation and distribution costs 4 leverage operating costs especially advertising distribution and corporate overhead 5 expand market opportunities via internet sales and 6 expand through selective acquisition as such opportunities arise to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complimentary strategy to organic growth 

we have experienced considerable sales growth over the past five years with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 120 we project an increase of 80 to 85 new stores in 2011 an increase of approximately 8 we opened 74 new stores in 2010 and 76 new stores in 2009 an increase of approximately 8 and 9 respectively 

we operated 1001 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states as of december 25 2010 we have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 800 potential additional markets for new tractor supply stores in the united states 

the average cash investment for new leased stores opened in 2010 was 12 million for retrofit stores and 09 million for prototype stores a majority of the cash outlay was for initial acquisition of inventory and capital expenditures principally leasehold improvements fixtures and equipment and approximately 92000 for preopening costs 

we have placed significant emphasis on our merchandising programs evaluating the sales and profitability of our products through detailed line reviews review of vendor performance measures and modification of the overall product offerings we believe these efforts coupled with a strong marketing program and indepth product knowledge training of our store team members have enhanced our sales and financial performance 

change in accounting method 

effective december 25 2010 the company elected to change its method of accounting for inventories from the lower of cost as determined by the lastin firstout “lifo” method or market to the lower of cost as determined by the average cost method or market the company believes the change is preferable as the average cost method better reflects the current value of inventory on the consolidated balance sheets provides a better reflection of periodic income and improves comparability with our peers 

the company has applied this change in method of inventory costing retrospectively to all prior periods presented herein in accordance with accounting principles relating to accounting changes all financial information in item 8 of this 10k has been retrospectively adjusted see note 1 significant accounting policies to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k for a complete discussion of our change in accounting method 

stock split 

 

on july 29 2010 our board of directors announced a twoforone split of our outstanding shares of common stock to be effected in the form of a stock dividend on september 2 2010 stockholders of record at the close of business on august 19 2010 were issued one additional share of common stock for each share owned by such stockholder the stock split increased the number of shares of common stock outstanding from approximately 363 million to approximately 727 million share and pershare amounts including stock options and restricted stock units shown in this form 10k reflect the split the total number of authorized common shares and the par value thereof was not changed by the split the number of shares held in treasury was not adjusted for the split 

seasonality and weather 

our business is highly seasonal historically our sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products unseasonable weather excessive precipitation drought and early or late frosts may also affect our sales we believe however that the impact of extreme weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of our stores 

we experience our highest inventory and accounts payable levels during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal product in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the winter selling season 

  

  

purchase price volatility 

although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items steel grain petroleum corn soybean and other commodities as well as transportation services therefore we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost which may impact consumer demand and as a result sales and gross margin our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale from increased volume of purchases adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality due to the competitive environment such conditions have and may continue to adversely impact our financial performance 

  

significant accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our financial position andor results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

  

  

quarterly financial data 

our unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2010 and 2009 are shown below in thousands except per share amounts 

 

 

 

 

  

results of operations 

our fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last saturday of the calendar year references to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ended the fiscal years ended december 25 2010 december 26 2009 and december 27 2008 contain 52 weeks all amounts have been adjusted to reflect the company’s election to change its method of accounting for inventories from the lastin firstout lifo method to the average cost method 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales 

 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

net sales increased 135 to 364 billion in fiscal 2010 from 321 billion in fiscal 2009 this increase resulted from the opening of new stores and a 70 increase in samestore sales the samestore average daily transaction count increased 74 while samestore transaction value decreased 03 for fiscal 2010 

samestore sales increased 70 compared with a samestore sales decrease of 11 in the prior year this samestore sales increase was broadbased and driven by strong results in core consumable categories principally animal and petrelated products as well as seasonal products including heating insulated outerwear and outdoor power equipment 

in fiscal 2010 we opened 74 new stores compared to 76 new stores in fiscal 2009 relocated no stores compared to two in fiscal 2009 and closed three stores compared to one store in fiscal 2009 

gross margin increased 155 to 120 billion compared to 104 billion in 2009 as a percent of sales gross margin increased to 331 for fiscal 2010 compared to 325 for fiscal 2009 the improvement in gross margin is primarily due to expanded direct product margin and a decrease in shrink partially offset by increased transportation costs the direct product margin improvement resulted from continued progress on margin driving initiatives which include strategic sourcing inventory management and more effective pricing 

as a percent of sales sga expenses including depreciation and amortization improved 70 basis points to 258 in fiscal 2010 from 265 in fiscal 2009 the improvement as a percent to sales was primarily attributable to the leverage of strong samestore sales and expense management partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation expense 

net interest expense decreased 219 to 13 million in fiscal 2010 from 16 million in fiscal 2009 this decrease is directly related to lower average borrowings and a decline in interest charges associated with sales tax audits 

our effective tax rate decreased to 366 for fiscal 2010 compared to 369 in fiscal 2009 this reduction in the tax resulted from a greater tax benefit received on the disqualified disposition of incentive stock options during fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

as a result of the foregoing factors net income for fiscal 2010 increased 403 to 1680 million or 225 per diluted share as compared to net income of 1197 million or 163 per diluted share in fiscal 2009 

during 2010 we repurchased approximately 08 million shares of stock for 382 million as part of our previously announced 400 million share repurchase program in 2009 we repurchased approximately 04 million shares at a total cost of 153 million as mentioned in note 1 – significant accounting policies in part ii of this form 10k the shares added to treasury were not adjusted for the stock split 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

net sales increased 66 to 321 billion in fiscal 2009 from 301 billion in fiscal 2008 this increase resulted from the opening of new stores partially offset by a 11 decrease in samestore sales the samestore average daily transaction count increased 53 while samestore transaction value decreased 60 for fiscal 2009 

samestore sales decreased 11 compared with a samestore sales increase of 14 in the prior year this samestore sales decline was primarily driven by softness in sales of seasonal big ticket merchandise priced 350 or greater and discretionary merchandise partially offset by continued strong results in core consumable categories including animal and petrelated products 

  

  

in fiscal 2009 we opened 76 new stores compared to 91 new stores in fiscal 2008 relocated two stores compared to one in fiscal 2008 and closed one store compared to no stores in fiscal 2008 

gross margin increased 91 to 10419 million compared to 9551 million in 2008 as a percent of sales gross margin increased to 325 for fiscal 2009 compared to 318 for fiscal 2008 the increase in gross margin resulted primarily from lower transportation costs 

as a percent of sales sga expenses increased 60 basis points to 244 in fiscal 2009 from 238 in fiscal 2008 this increase as a percent of sales was primarily attributable to the deleveraging related to the samestore sales decrease and higher incentive compensation and occupancy costs partially offset by reduced marketing costs depreciation and amortization expense increased 10 basis points as a percent of sales in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 due mainly to costs associated with new stores 

net interest expense decreased 229 to 16 million in fiscal 2009 from 21 million in fiscal 2008 however net interest expense remained consistent as a percent of sales this decrease is directly related to lower average borrowings partially offset by higher interest charges associated with sales tax audits 

our effective tax rate decreased to 369 for fiscal 2009 compared to 387 in fiscal 2008 this reduction in the tax resulted from the favorable impact of certain federal tax credits and a lower percentage of unfavorable permanent tax differences relative to income before taxes 

as a result of the foregoing factors net income for fiscal 2009 increased 109 to 1197 million or 163 per diluted share as compared to net income of 1080 million or 144 per diluted share in fiscal 2008 

during 2009 we repurchased approximately 04 million shares of stock for 153 million as part of our previously announced 400 million share repurchase program in 2008 we repurchased approximately 16 million shares at a total cost of 539 million as mentioned in note 1 – significant accounting policies in part ii of this form 10k the shares added to treasury were not adjusted for the stock split 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

in addition to normal operating expenses our primary ongoing cash requirements are for expansion remodeling and relocation programs including inventory purchases and capital expenditures our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are existing cash balances funds provided from operations commitments available under our revolving credit agreement capital and operating leases and normal trade credit our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the spring and winter selling seasons respectively 

financial markets experienced volatility in the past few years resulting in disruptions in credit and lending activities further disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the ability of the banks to meet their commitments our access to funds under the credit facility is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time we have a diversified banking group which we believe should help mitigate any potential disruptions if one occurs 

working capital 

at december 25 2010 we had working capital of 6171 million a 1412 million increase from december 26 2009 this increase was primarily attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities in millions 

 

in comparison to prior year end working capital increased primarily as a result of an increase in cash and inventory the increase in cash resulted principally from stronger earnings the increase in inventory was primarily due to new store growth average inventory per store remained nearly flat at 709000 for fiscal 2010 compared to 707000 for fiscal 2009 this was partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses principally as a result of timing of payments and higher incentive compensation accruals over the prior year 

accounts payable has declined as a result of an increase in cash held in our bank concentration account which nets against accounts payable as well as more timely payments in order to capture payment discounts offered by our vendors trade credit arises from our vendors granting payment terms for inventory purchases payment terms generally vary from 30 days to 180 days depending on the inventory product certain vendors offer payment discounts for payments made within a shorter period typically within 10 to 15 days 

  

  

borrowings and credit facilities 

we are party to a senior credit facility with bank of america na as agent for a lender group the “credit agreement” which provides for borrowings up to 350 million with sublimits of 75 million and 20 million for letters of credit and swingline loans respectively the credit agreement has an increase option for 150 million subject to additional lender group commitments the credit agreement is unsecured and matures in february 2012 with proceeds expected to be used for working capital capital expenditures and share repurchases 

at december 25 2010 and december 26 2009 there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement there were 274 million and 352 million outstanding letters of credit as of december 25 2010 and december 26 2009 respectively borrowings bear interest at either the bank’s base rate 325 at december 25 2010 or the london interbank offer rate “libor” 026 at december 25 2010 plus an additional amount ranging from 035 to 090 per annum adjusted quarterly based on our performance 040 at december 25 2010 we are also required to pay quarterly in arrears a commitment fee ranging from 006 to 018 per annum and adjusted quarterly based on our performance for unused capacity 0075 at december 25 2010 there are no compensating balance requirements associated with the credit agreement 

the credit agreement requires quarterly compliance with respect to two material covenants a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio the fixed charge coverage ratio principally compares earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization stock compensation and rent expense “consolidated ebitdar” to the sum of interest paid and rental expense excluding straightline rent the leverage ratio principally compares total debt plus rental expense excluding straightline rent multiplied by a factor of six to consolidated ebitdar the credit agreement also contains certain other restrictions regarding additional indebtedness capital expenditures business operations guarantees investments mergers consolidations and sales of assets transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates and liens we were in compliance with all covenants at december 25 2010 

sources and uses of cash 

our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures and financing activities are payments on debt repurchase of the company’s common stock and payment of common stock dividends the following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years in millions 

 

operating activities 

the 73 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities in millions 

 

cash flow from operating activities continues to provide the primary source of our liquidity the increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to stronger net income and an increase in accrued expenses partially offset by an increase in inventory net of accounts payable and an increase in prepaids and other current assets continued store growth has resulted in increased inventory balances accounts payable levels have decreased as a result of more timely payments in order to capture payment discounts offered by vendors and also as a result of an increase in cash held in our bank concentration account the bank concentration account nets against the related book overdraft included in accounts payable accrued expenses increased as a result of timing of payments as well as incentive compensation earned in fiscal 2010 but not paid until fiscal 2011 

the 24 million decrease in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities in millions 

 

  

  

the decrease in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 was due to changes in inventory levels and the timing of payments partially offset by higher net income and an increase in accrued expenses inventory levels remained nearly flat in 2009 compared to 2008 due to a continued focus on inventory management in 2009 accounts payable levels have decreased substantially as a result of more timely payments to capture payment discounts offered by vendors accrued expenses increased as a result of timing of payments as well as incentive compensation earned in fiscal 2009 but not paid until fiscal 2010 

investing activities 

investing activities used 1121 million 738 million and 884 million in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the majority of this cash requirement relates to our capital expenditures our significant store expansion coupled with required investment in infrastructure resulted in the following capital expenditures including capital leases in millions 

 

our longterm growth strategy anticipates continued geographic market expansion and further concentration within existing markets this growth will also require continuing investment in information technology the costs reflected above are typically building improvements as we lease the majority of our facilities we currently estimate that capital expenditures will range between 150 million and 160 million in fiscal 2011 while we plan to open only a few more stores in 2011 compared to 2010 we expect to have additional capital expenditures next year as we construct a new distribution center and implement a comprehensive warehouse management system designed to improve throughput and efficiencies in the distribution center network along with other efficiencydriving system enhancements in 2011 

financing activities 

financing activities used 260 million 56 million and 1055 million in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2010 is mainly the result of quarterly cash dividends paid to stockholders and repurchases of common stock partially offset by increased net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to sharebased compensation 

we have a boardapproved share repurchase program which provides for repurchase of up to 400 million of common stock exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses related to such repurchases through december 2011 the repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions the timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors including price corporate and regulatory requirements capital availability and other market conditions repurchased shares will be held in treasury the program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice 

we repurchased approximately 08 million 04 million and 16 million shares under the share repurchase program for a total cost of 382 million 153 million and 539 million in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively as mentioned in note 1 – significant accounting policies in part ii of this form 10k the shares added to treasury were not adjusted for the stock split repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance as of december 25 2010 we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of 1428 million exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses 

we believe that our existing cash balances expected cash flow from future operations borrowings available under the credit agreement and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs including store openings relocations and renovations over the next several years 

significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of december 25 2010 in thousands 

 

 

 

 

 

the company had outstanding letters of credit of 274 million as of december 25 2010 

  

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements consist of operating leases and outstanding letters of credit the balances for these arrangements are discussed above we typically lease buildings for retail stores and offices rather than acquiring these assets which allows us to utilize financial capital to operate the business rather than invest in fixed assets letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory primarily sourced overseas and support certain risk management programs in a timely manner

we offer a differentiated assortment of products for our customers our broad product assortment is tailored to meet the regional and geographic needs of our markets as well as the physical store size our full line of product offerings is supported by a strong instock inventory position with an average of 15500 to 19000 unique products per store no one product accounted for more than 10 of our sales during 2009 

our stores carry a wide selection of high quality nationally recognized name brand merchandise we also market a growing list of products under our “privatelabel programs” ie products manufactured by a number of vendors at our direction and specifically for our sole benefit the trademarks in the private label brand names are owned by us our private label brands include

we believe that the availability of top quality private label products at great prices provides superior value for our customers a strategic advantage for us and positions us as a destination store 

the following chart indicates the average percentages of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

 

 purchasing 

we offer a differentiated assortment of products that are sourced through domestic and international vendors for those seeking to enjoy the “ out here ” lifestyle our business is not dependent upon any one vendor or particular group of vendors we purchase our products from a core group of approximately 850 vendors with no one vendor representing more than 10 of our purchases during fiscal 2009 approximately 250 vendors accounted for approximately 90 of our purchases during fiscal 2009 we have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative sources of supply for our products and we believe that adequate sources of supply exist at substantially similar costs for substantially all of our products we have no material longterm contractual commitments with any of our vendors 

we maintain a dedicated inventory management team to focus exclusively on all replenishment and forecasting functions this centralized direction permits our buying teams to focus more strategic attention toward vendor line reviews assortment planning and testing of new products and programs through the combined efforts of these teams we have improved our overall inventory productivity and instock position 

over 97 of our purchase orders are transmitted through an electronic data interchange “edi” system and approximately 95 of merchandise vendor invoices are transmitted through edi we are expanding the percentage of vendors who electronically transmit invoices and increasing the amount of sales history transmitted 

distribution 

we currently operate a distribution network for supplying our stores with merchandise and in fiscal 2009 our stores received approximately 67 of our merchandise through this network our six distribution centers are located in indiana georgia maryland texas nebraska and washington representing total distribution capacity of 29 million square feet in 2010 we are not planning any additional distribution center square footage as we concentrate on increasing the utilization of our existing space 

  3 

we manage our inbound and outbound transportation activity inhouse through the use of a webbased transportation management system we outsource the operation of our dedicated fleet to two thirdparty logistics providers and utilize several common carriers as required for store deliveries the thirdparty logistics providers are responsible for managing drivers and tractors contracted to us and they deliver animal feed products directly to stores from our vendors we control our transportation costs through the monitoring of transportation routes and scheduling of deliveries and backhauls while minimizing empty miles 

marketing 

we utilize an “everyday value prices” strategy to consistently offer our products at competitive prices complemented by promotions primarily implemented during peak selling seasons we regularly monitor prices at competing stores and adjust our prices as appropriate 

to generate store traffic and position ourselves as a destination store we promote broad selections of merchandise with newspaper circulars customer targeted direct mail and internet offerings vendors frequently support these specific programs by offering temporary cost reductions honoring coupons and funding gift card rebate programs 

due to the relatively small size of our stores increased traffic in the store ensures increased exposure to our products our vendors are committed to helping us promote our brand and position ourselves as a destination store our vendors provide assistance with product presentation and rack design brochures pointofpurchase materials for customers’ education and product education for our team members we also receive funding through contributions and incentives on purchases to promote new stores and earn rebates from vendors on product purchases based on volume 

competition 

we operate in a competitive market the principal competitive factors include location of stores price and quality of merchandise instock consistency merchandise assortment and presentation and customer service we compete with general merchandise retailers home center retailers and other specialty and discount retailers as well as independently owned retail farm and ranch stores numerous privatelyheld regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives some of these competitors are units of national or regional chains and may have substantially greater resources and financial capacities than we do however we believe we have successfully differentiated ourselves from these entities by focusing on our specialized market niche for customers living the rural lifestyle 

management and team members 

as of december 26 2009 we employed approximately 7600 fulltime and approximately 5700 parttime team members we also employ additional parttime team members during peak periods we are not party to any collective bargaining agreements 

our store operations are organized by location into eight regions each region is led by a regional manager and the region is further organized into districts which are led by a district manager our regional and district managers store managers and other distribution and support personnel have contributed significantly to our performance we have an internal advisory board comprised of store managers this group brings a grassroots perspective to operational initiatives and generates chainwide endorsement of proposed “bestpractice” solutions 

we are committed to a continuous improvement program called tractor value system “tvs” tvs is a commitment to provide through team member engagement a business management system that emphasizes continuous improvement by embracing change of current practices to reduce cost shorten lead times and drive innovation we have implemented numerous tvs project teams comprised of team members from all areas of our operations to evaluate key operations and implement process changes that will both improve efficiency and strengthen controls our management encourages the participation of all team members in decisionmaking regularly solicits input and suggestions from our team members and responds to the suggestions 

  4 

all of our team members participate in one of various incentive programs which provide the opportunity to receive additional compensation based upon team andor company performance we also provide our team members the opportunity to participate in an employee stock purchase plan and a 401k retirement savings plan we contribute to the 401k savings plan solely through a cash match additionally we share in the cost of health insurance provided to our team members and team members receive a discount on merchandise purchased at our stores 

we encourage a “promote from within” environment when internal resources permit we also provide internal leadership development programs designed to mentor our high potential team members for continued progress and believe we have satisfactory relationships with our team members our district managers and store managers have an average length of service of approximately five years management believes internal promotions coupled with the hiring of individuals with previous retail experience will provide the management structure necessary to support our planned store growth 

management information and control systems 

we have invested considerable resources in our management information and control systems to ensure superior customer service manage the purchase and distribution of our merchandise and improve our operating efficiencies our management information and control systems include a pointofsale system a supply chain management and replenishment system a radio frequency and voice picking system in the distribution centers a vendor purchase order control system and a merchandise presentation system these systems are integrated through an enterprise resource planning “erp” system this erp system tracks merchandise from initial order through ultimate sale and interfaces with our financial systems 

we continue to evaluate and improve the functionality of our systems to maximize their effectiveness such efforts include ongoing hardware and software evaluations and upgrades to support optimal software configurations and application performance we plan to upgrade our information technology and implement other efficiencydriving system enhancements including the continued rollout of a new pointofsale system an upgrade to our erp system and a planned rollout of a new warehouse management system in 2010 these efforts are directed toward constantly improving the overall business processes and achieving the most efficient and effective use of the systems to manage our operations while ensuring a secure and reliable environment 

growth strategy 

our current and longterm growth strategy is to 1 expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores 2 enhance financial performance through samestore sales increases achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an “everyday value prices” philosophy and supported by strong customer service 3 enhance product margin through assortment management vendor management global sourcing and optimization of transportation and distribution costs 4 leverage operating costs especially advertising distribution and corporate overhead 5 expand market opportunities via internet sales and 6 expand through selective acquisition as such opportunities arise to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complementary strategy to organic growth 

we have experienced considerable sales growth over the last five years with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 130 we project an increase of 70 to 80 new stores in 2010 an increase of approximately 8 we opened 76 new stores in 2009 and 91 new stores in 2008 an increase of approximately 9 and 12 respectively 

we operated 930 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states as of december 26 2009 and have plans to open 70 to 80 stores in fiscal 2010 we have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 850 potential additional markets for new tractor supply stores excluding del’s in the united states the acquisition of del’s enabled us to establish an initial presence in the pacific northwest primarily in washington along with three stores in hawaii we have slowed the growth of del’s as we refine the concept and we do not plan to open any additional del’s stores in fiscal 2010

 item 1a  risk factors 

our business faces many risks those risks which we are currently aware and we deem to be material are described below if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur our business financial condition or results of operations may significantly suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this form 10k 

general economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance 

our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending including discretionary spending economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels business conditions interest rates tax rates fuel and energy costs higher labor and healthcare costs the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to lowerpriced competitors a general reduction in the level of discretionary spending or shifts in consumer discretionary spending to our competitors could adversely affect our growth and profitability additionally changes in the mix of products sold to a mix with a lower overall gross margin or other increased cost of sales along with slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory could adversely affect our operations and operating results 

purchase price volatility including inflationary and deflationary pressures may adversely affect our financial performance 

although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items steel grain petroleum corn soybean and other commodities as well as transportation services therefore we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost which may impact consumer demand and as a result sales and gross margin additionally significant inflationary pressures could have an adverse affect on our lastin firstout lifo inventory provision which would negatively impact gross margin our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale from increased volume of purchases adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality due to the competitive environment such conditions have and may continue to adversely impact our financial performance 

there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to increase sales at our existing stores 

we experience fluctuations in our samestore sales which are defined as stores which have completed twelve months of sales our success depends in part upon our ability to improve sales at our existing stores various factors affect samestore sales including the general retail sales environment our ability to efficiently source and distribute products changes in our merchandise mix competition current economic conditions the timing of release of new merchandise and promotional events the success of marketing programs and weather conditions these factors may cause our same store sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations past samestore sales are not necessarily an indication of future results and there can be no assurance that our samestore sales will not decrease in the future 

  6 

our failure to effectively manage growth could impair our business 

even if we are able to implement to a significant degree our key business strategy of expanding our store base we may experience managerial or operational problems which may prevent any expected increase in profitability or negatively impact our cash flow to manage our planned expansion we must ensure the continuing adequacy of our existing systems controls and procedures including product distribution facilities store management financial controls and information systems there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our planned expansion that the new stores will be effectively integrated into our existing operations or that such stores will be profitable 

capital requirements for growth may not be available 

the construction and opening or acquisition of new stores and the development of new production and distribution facilities along with the remodeling and renovation of existing stores require significant amounts of capital in the past our growth has been funded primarily through bank borrowings and internally generated cash flow 

disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the ability of the banks to meet their commitments our access to funds under the credit facility is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time 

longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty changing or increased regulation reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases or other discretionary uses of cash 

failure to open new stores in the manner currently contemplated could adversely affect our financial performance 

an integral part of our business strategy includes the expansion of our base of stores by opening new stores this expansion strategy is dependent on our ability to find suitable locations and we face competition from many retailers for such sites if we are unable to implement this strategy our ability to increase our sales profitability and cash flow could be impaired significantly to the extent that we are unable to open new stores in the manner we anticipate due to among other reasons site approval or unforeseen delays in construction our sales growth may be impeded 

new stores may negatively impact our results 

there can be no assurance that our new store openings will be successful or result in greater sales and profitability for the company new stores build their sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection over time and as a result generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales than our more mature stores as we continue to open new stores there may be a negative impact on our results from a lower contribution margin of these new stores until their sales levels ramp to chain average as well as from the impact of related preopening costs 

competition in our industry may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations 

we operate in a very competitive market the principal competitive factors include location of stores price and quality of merchandise instock consistency merchandise assortment and presentation and customer service we believe we have successfully differentiated ourselves from general merchandise retailers home center retailers and other specialty and discount retailers by focusing on our specialized market niche however we do face competition from these entities as well as competition from independentlyowned retail farm and ranch stores privatelyheld regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives some of our competitors are units of national or regional chains that have substantially greater financial and other resources 

weather conditions may have a significant impact on our financial results 

historically weather conditions have had a significant impact on our operating results weather conditions affect the demand for and in some cases the supply of products which in turn has an impact on prices in past years we have experienced extreme weather conditions including snow and ice storms flood and wind damage hurricanes tornadoes and droughts in some states weather conditions also directly affect the demand for seasonal products particularly during the winter heating season accordingly the weather can have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  7 

there are certain risks associated with the seasonal nature of our business 

our working capital needs and borrowings generally peak in our first and third fiscal quarters because lower sales are generated while expenses are incurred and inventory is increased in preparation for the spring and winter selling seasons if cash on hand and borrowings under existing credit facilities are insufficient to meet the seasonal needs or if cash flow generated during the spring and winter is insufficient to repay associated borrowings on a timely basis this seasonality could have a material adverse effect on our business 

there is no assurance that our merchandising initiatives and marketing emphasis will provide expected results 

we believe our past performance has been based on and future success will depend upon in part the ability to develop and execute merchandising initiatives with effective marketing there is no assurance that we will be successful or that new initiatives will be executed in a timely manner to satisfy our customers’ needs or expectations failure to execute and promote such initiatives in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow the business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition additionally our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demand and preferences for merchandise if we misjudge the market we may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to take significant inventory markdowns shortages of key items could also have a materially adverse impact on operating results 

we face risks associated with vendors from whom our products are sourced 

the products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors all of our vendors must comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting required vendor standards of conduct we rely on foreign manufacturers for various products that we sell in addition many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources we rely on longterm relationships with our suppliers but have no longterm contracts with such suppliers our future success will depend in large measure upon our ability to maintain our existing supplier relationships or to develop new ones this reliance increases the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various products due to local political economic social or environmental conditions transportation delays restrictive actions by foreign governments or changes in united states laws and regulations affecting imports or domestic distribution our vendors may be forced to reduce their production shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection which in some cases would make it difficult for us to serve the market’s needs and could have a material adverse effect on our business as an importer our business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business abroad such as foreign governmental regulations economic disruptions delays in shipments transportation capacity and costs currency exchange rates and changes in political or economic conditions in countries from which we purchase products if any such factors were to render the conduct of business in particular countries undesirable or impractical or if additional united states quotas duties taxes or other charges or restrictions were imposed upon the importation of our products in the future our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our failure to attract and retain qualified team members could adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to continue expanding operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified team members our ability to meet labor needs while controlling wage and related labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force unemployment levels prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation if we are unable to locate attract or retain qualified personnel or if costs of labor or related costs increase significantly our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we may be subject to product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business 

our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business we maintain general liability insurance with a deductible for each occurrence and a 33000000 aggregate retention applicable to all general liability and workers compensation claims we also maintain umbrella limits above the primary general liability and product liability cover in many cases we have indemnification rights against the manufacturers of the products and their products liability insurance our ability to recover under such insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject to the financial viability of the insurers and manufacturers and the specific allegations of a claim no assurance can be given that our insurance coverage or the manufacturers’ indemnity will be available or sufficient in any claims brought against us 

legal proceedings could materially impact our results 

from time to time we are party to legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and employment issues personal injury intellectual property and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business our results could be materially impacted by the decisions and expenses related to pending or future proceedings 

  8 

if we experience difficulties with our management information systems our financial performance may be adversely affected 

we depend on management information systems for many aspects of our business we could be materially adversely affected if our management information systems are disrupted or if we are unable to improve upgrade maintain and expand systems particularly in light of the contemplated continued store growth many of our information systems contain confidential customer company or employee data if we fail to adequately restrict access to this information our financial performance could be adversely affected 

effective tax rate changes and results of examinations by taxing authorities could materially impact our results 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the earnings mix being lower than historical results in states where we have lower statutory rates and higher than historical results in states where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the internal revenue service “irs” and other state and local taxing authorities our results could be materially impacted by the determinations and expenses related to these and other proceedings by the irs and other state and local taxing authorities 

failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business and results 

the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting an internal control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition asset impairment inventories lease obligations selfinsurance tax matters and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates or judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition

 item 7    management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

overview 

tractor supply company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the united states and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and of those who enjoy the rural lifestyle as well as tradesmen and small businesses we operate retail stores under the names tractor supply company and del’s farm supply and operate a website under the name tractorsupplycom  our stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities and they offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our tractor supply stores typically range in size from 15500 square feet to 18500 square feet of inside selling space and additional outside selling space we use a standard 15500 square foot prototype for new purposebuilt locations for new existing buildings one of several layout formats is utilized 

our whollyowned subsidiary del’s which operated 27 stores as of december 26 2009 in washington oregon idaho and hawaii offers a wide selection of products primarily in the equine pet and animal category tailored to those who enjoy the rural lifestyle del’s stores currently range in size from approximately 2000 to 6000 square feet of inside selling space plus additional outside and coveredsheltered selling space 

our current and longterm growth strategy is to 1 expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores 2 enhance financial performance through samestore sales increases achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an “everyday value prices” philosophy and supported by strong customer service 3 enhance product margin through assortment management vendor management sourcing and optimization of transportation and distribution costs 4 leverage operating costs especially advertising distribution and corporate overhead 5 expand market opportunities via internet sales and 6 expand through selective acquisition as such opportunities arise to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complimentary strategy to organic growth 

we have experienced considerable sales growth over the last five years with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 130 we project an increase of 70 to 80 new stores in 2010 an increase of approximately 8 we opened 76 new stores in 2009 and 91 new stores in 2008 an increase of approximately 9 and 12 respectively 

we operated 930 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states as of december 26 2009 and have plans to open 70 to 80 stores in fiscal 2010 we have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 850 potential additional markets for new tractor supply stores excluding del’s in the united states the acquisition of del’s enabled us to establish an initial presence in the pacific northwest primarily in washington along with three stores in hawaii we have slowed the growth of del’s as we refine the concept and we do not plan to open any additional del’s stores in fiscal 2010 

the average cash investment for new leased stores opened in 2009 was 13 million for retrofit stores and 10 million for prototype stores a majority of the cash outlay was for initial acquisition of inventory and capital expenditures principally leasehold improvements fixtures and equipment and approximately 102000 for preopening costs 

we have placed significant emphasis on our merchandising programs evaluating the sales and profitability of our products through detailed line reviews review of vendor performance measures and modification of the overall product offerings we believe these efforts coupled with a strong marketing program and indepth product knowledge training of our store team members have enhanced our sales and financial performance 

  16 

seasonality and weather 

our business is highly seasonal historically our sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of each year due to the sale of seasonal products unseasonable weather excessive precipitation drought and early or late frosts may also affect our sales we believe however that the impact of extreme weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of our stores 

we experience our highest inventory and accounts payable levels during our first fiscal quarter each year for purchases of seasonal product in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the winter selling season 

purchase price volatility 

although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items steel grain petroleum corn soybean and other commodities as well as transportation services therefore we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost which may impact consumer demand and as a result sales and gross margin additionally significant inflationary pressures could have an adverse affect on our lastin firstout lifo inventory provision which would negatively impact gross margin our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale from increased volume of purchases adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality due to the competitive environment such conditions have and may continue to adversely impact our financial performance 

significant accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our financial position andor results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates

quarterly financial data

results of operations 

our fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last saturday of the calendar year references to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ended the fiscal years ended december 26 2009 december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 contain 52 weeks 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales 

 

 

 fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

net sales increased 66 to 321 billion in fiscal 2009 from 301 billion in fiscal 2008 this increase resulted from the opening of new stores partially offset by a 11 decrease in samestore sales the samestore average daily transaction count increased 53 while samestore transaction value decreased 60 for fiscal 2009 

samestore sales decreased 11 compared with a samestore sales increase of 14 in the prior year this samestore sales decline was primarily driven by softness in sales of seasonal big ticket merchandise priced 350 or greater and discretionary merchandise partially offset by continued strong results in core consumable categories including animal and petrelated products 

in fiscal 2009 we opened 76 new stores compared to 91 new stores in fiscal 2008 relocated two stores compared to one in fiscal 2008 and closed one store compared to no stores in fiscal 2008 

gross margin increased 134 to 10350 million compared to 9123 million in 2008 as a percent of sales gross margin increased to 323 for fiscal 2009 compared to 303 for fiscal 2008 the increase in gross margin resulted primarily from a substantial decrease in the lifo provision and lower transportation costs 

the lifo charge decreased by 359 million to 69 million in fiscal 2009 compared to 428 million in fiscal 2008 the decrease is due to an overall decline in the rate of inflation and cost reductions in certain product categories even as inflation moderates and inventory per store declines we continue to generate a lifo charge as we add merchandise that has higher inflation indices than the existing company average 

as a percent of sales sga expenses increased 60 basis points to 244 in fiscal 2009 from 238 in fiscal 2008 this increase as a percent of sales was primarily attributable to the deleveraging related to the samestore sales decrease and higher incentive compensation and occupancy costs partially offset by reduced marketing costs depreciation and amortization expense increased 10 basis points as a percent of sales in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 due mainly to costs associated with new stores 

  25 

net interest expense decreased 229 to 16 million in fiscal 2009 from 21 million in fiscal 2008 however net interest expense remained consistent as a percent of sales this decrease is directly related to lower average borrowings partially offset by higher interest charges associated with sales tax audits 

our effective tax rate decreased to 369 for fiscal 2009 compared to 386 in fiscal 2008 this reduction in the tax resulted from the favorable impact of certain federal tax credits and a lower percentage of unfavorable permanent tax differences relative to income before taxes 

as a result of the foregoing factors net income for fiscal 2009 increased 409 to 1155 million or 315 per diluted share as compared to net income of 819 million or 219 per diluted share in fiscal 2008 

during 2009 we repurchased approximately 04 million shares of stock for 153 million as part of our previously announced 400 million share repurchase program in 2008 we repurchased approximately 16 million shares at a total cost of 539 million 

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

net sales increased 113 to 30079 million in fiscal 2008 from 27032 million in fiscal 2007 this increase resulted from the opening of new stores as well as a samestore sales improvement of 14 the samestore average daily transaction count increased 01 while samestore transaction value increased 13 for fiscal 2008 

samestore sales improvements of 14 compared to 34 in the prior year were strongest in core consumable categories including animal and petrelated products clothing and footwear 

in fiscal 2008 we opened 91 new stores compared to 89 new stores in fiscal 2007 relocated one store compared to 12 in fiscal 2007 and closed no stores compared to selling our only del’s store located in canada in fiscal 2007 

gross margin increased 70 to 9123 million compared to 8527 million in 2007 as a percent of sales gross margin decreased to 303 for fiscal 2008 compared to 315 for fiscal 2007 the decrease in gross margin resulted primarily from a substantial increase in the lifo provision the lifo provision increased by 376 million to 428 million in fiscal 2008 compared to 52 million in fiscal 2007 the increase is due to significant inflation increases in costs for certain commodities petroleumbased products and steel a shift in the product mix towards higher turning higher inflationary items and clearance activity 

as a percent of sales sga expenses increased 10 basis points to 238 in fiscal 2008 from 237 in fiscal 2007 this increase was due largely to occupancy and payroll expenses relating to new stores which generally have higher costs in relation to sales volume than the chain average offset by an aggressive expense management program depreciation and amortization expense increased 189 in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 due mainly to costs associated with new stores 

net interest expense decreased 10 basis points as a percent of sales to 21 million in fiscal 2008 from 50 million in fiscal 2007 this decrease is directly related to a lower average debt balance primarily due to a reduction in stock repurchase activity in 2008 as compared to 2007 

our effective tax rate increased to 386 for fiscal 2008 compared to 379 in fiscal 2007 resulting primarily from increases in state tax rates 

as a result of the foregoing factors net income for fiscal 2008 decreased 149 to 819 million or 219 per diluted share as compared to net income of 962 million or 240 per diluted share in fiscal 2007 

during 2008 we repurchased approximately 16 million shares of stock for 539 million as part of our previously announced 400 million share repurchase program in 2007 we repurchased approximately 32 million shares at a total cost of 1500 million

liquidity and capital resources 

in addition to normal operating expenses our primary ongoing cash requirements are for expansion remodeling and relocation programs including inventory purchases and capital expenditures our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are existing cash balances funds provided from operations commitments available under our revolving credit agreement capital and operating leases and normal trade credit our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the spring and winter selling seasons respectively 

financial markets experienced extreme volatility in 2008 and 2009 amid negative developments in housing and mortgagerelated activities weakness of major financial institutions governmental actions and negative economic developments these conditions have resulted in disruptions in credit and lending activities 

disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the ability of the banks to meet their commitments our access to funds under the credit facility is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time we have experienced no inability by our banks to meet borrowing requests we have a diversified banking group which we believe should help mitigate any potential disruptions if one occurs 

working capital 

at december 26 2009 we had working capital of 4157 million a 1325 million increase from december 27 2008 this increase was primarily attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities in millions 

 

in comparison to prior year end working capital increased primarily as a result of an increase in cash the increase in cash resulted principally from stronger earnings a decrease in net repayments under the revolving credit agreement reduced share repurchase activity and a decline in average inventory per store and capital expenditure activity this was partially offset by increased accrued expenses principally as a result of timing of payments and higher incentive compensation accruals over the prior year 

we have aggressively managed inventory and reduced our average inventory per store due to planned inventory management initiatives while improving our in stock levels accounts payable has also declined as a result of more timely payments on accounts payable in order to capture payment discounts offered by our vendors trade credit arises from our vendors granting payment terms for inventory purchases payment terms generally vary from 30 days to 180 days depending on the inventory product certain vendors offer payment discounts for payments made within a shorter period typically within 10 to 15 days 

borrowings and credit facilities 

we are party to a senior credit facility with bank of america na as agent for a lender group the “credit agreement” which provides for borrowings up to 350 million with sublimits of 75 million and 20 million for letters of credit and swingline loans respectively the credit agreement has an increase option for 150 million subject to additional lender group commitments the credit agreement is unsecured and matures in february 2012 with proceeds expected to be used for working capital capital expenditures and share repurchases 

  27 

at december 26 2009 and december 27 2008 there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement there were 352 million and 251 million outstanding letters of credit as of december 26 2009 and december 27 2008 respectively borrowings bear interest at either the bank’s base rate 325 at december 26 2009 or the london interbank offer rate “libor” 023 at december 26 2009 plus an additional amount ranging from 035 to 090 per annum adjusted quarterly based on our performance 050 at december 26 2009 we are also required to pay quarterly in arrears a commitment fee ranging from 006 to 018 per annum and adjusted quarterly based on our performance for unused capacity 010 at december 26 2009 there are no compensating balance requirements associated with the credit agreement 

the credit agreement requires quarterly compliance with respect to two material covenants a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio the fixed charge coverage ratio principally compares earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization stock compensation and rent expense “consolidated ebitdar” to the sum of interest paid and rental expense excluding straightline rent the leverage ratio principally compares total debt plus rental expense excluding straightline rent multiplied by a factor of six to consolidated ebitdar the credit agreement also contains certain other restrictions regarding additional indebtedness capital expenditures business operations guarantees investments mergers consolidations and sales of assets transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates and liens we were in compliance with all covenants at december 26 2009 

sources and uses of cash 

our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures and financing activities are payments on debt and repurchase of the company’s common stock the following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years in millions 

 

operating activities 

the 24 million decrease in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities in millions 

 

cash flow from operating activities continues to provide the primary source of our liquidity the decrease in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 was primarily due to changes in inventory levels and the timing of payments inventory levels decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 due to a continued focus on inventory management in 2009 accounts payable levels have decreased at a greater rate as a result of more timely payments to capture payment discounts offered by vendors 

the 629 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities in millions 

 

  28 

the improvement in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 was primarily due to changes in inventory levels and the timing of payments inventory levels decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to an increased focus on inventory management 

investing activities 

investing activities used 738 million 884 million and 826 million in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the majority of this cash requirement relates to our capital expenditures 

our significant store expansion coupled with required investment in infrastructure resulted in the following capital expenditures including capital leases in millions 

 

our longterm growth strategy anticipates continued geographic market expansion and further concentration within existing markets this growth will also require continuing investment in information technology the costs reflected above are typically building improvements as we lease the majority of our facilities we currently estimate that capital expenditures will range between 90 million and 100 million in fiscal 2010 while we plan to open approximately the same number of stores in 2010 compared to 2009 we expect to have additional capital expenditures next year including a comprehensive warehouse management system designed to improve throughput and efficiencies in the distribution center network and other efficiencydriving system enhancements in 2010 

financing activities 

financing activities used 56 million 1055 million and 851 million in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2009 is mainly the result of share repurchase activity and borrowings and repayments under the credit agreement 

we have a boardapproved share repurchase program which provides for repurchase of up to 400 million of common stock exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses related to such repurchases through december 2011 the repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions the timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors including price corporate and regulatory requirements capital availability and other market conditions repurchased shares will be held in treasury the program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice as of december 26 2009 we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of 1810 million exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses 

we repurchased approximately 04 million 16 million and 32 million shares for a total cost of 153 million 539 million and 1500 million in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance 

we believe that our existing cash balances expected cash flow from future operations borrowings available under the credit agreement and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs including store openings relocations and renovations over the next several years 

  29 

significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of december 26 2009 in thousands 

 

 

 the company had outstanding letters of credit of 352 million as of december 26 2009 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements consist of operating leases and outstanding letters of credit the balances for these arrangements are discussed above we typically lease buildings for retail stores and offices rather than acquiring these assets which allows us to utilize financial capital to operate the business rather than invest in fixed assets letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory primarily sourced overseas and support certain risk management programs in a timely manner 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in december 2007 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” modified fasb accounting standards codification “asc” 805 business combinations “topic 805” previous guidance applied only to business combinations in which control was obtained by transferring consideration the revised guidance applies to all transactions or other events in which one entity obtains control over another topic 805 now defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control over one or more other businesses and defines the acquisition date as the date the acquirer achieves control it also requires the acquirer to recognize assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date the revised guidance changes the treatment of acquisitionrelated costs restructuring costs related to an acquisition that the acquirer expects but is not obligated to incur contingent consideration associated with the purchase price and preacquisition contingencies associated with acquired assets and liabilities topic 805 retains the guidance for identifying and recognizing intangible assets apart from goodwill the revised guidance applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2008 we adopted this revised guidance effective december 28 2008 fiscal 2009 thus we are required to apply the revised guidance to any business acquisition which occurs on or after december 28 2008 but this modification had no effect on prior acquisitions 

in april 2008 the fasb modified fasb asc 350 intangibles – goodwill and other and fasb asc 275 risks and uncertainties for factors that must be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life over which to amortize the cost of a recognized intangible asset the modification requires an entity to consider its own assumptions about renewal or extension of the term of the arrangement consistent with its expected use of the asset and is an attempt to improve consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset we adopted the guidance for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset effective december 28 2008 fiscal 2009 and the guidance is applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date the guidance did not have an impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

on april 9 2009 the fasb modified fasb asc 825 financial instruments and fasb asc 270 interim reporting to extend the disclosure requirements related to the fair value of financial instruments to interim financial statements of publicly traded companies we adopted this guidance effective june 27 2009 this guidance did not have a significant impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

  30 

in may 2009 the fasb modified fasb asc 855 subsequent events which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued and requires entities to disclose the date through which they have evaluated subsequent events we adopted this guidance effective june 27 2009 the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in june 2009 the fasb issued accounting standards update “asu” no 200901 topic 105 generally accepted accounting principles which establishes the fasb asc the fasb asc is the single source of authoritative nongovernmental us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” superseding existing fasb american institute of certified public accountants emerging issues task force and related accounting literature the fasb asc reorganizes the thousands of gaap pronouncements into roughly 90 accounting topics and displays them using a consistent structure also included is relevant securities and exchange commission guidance organized using the same topical structure in separate sections we adopted asu no 200901 effective september 26 2009 this impacted the company’s notes to financial statements since all references to authoritative accounting literature are referenced in accordance with the fasb asc 




 i tem 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from the credit agreement the credit agreement bears interest at either the bank’s base rate 325 at both december 26 2009 and december 27 2008 or libor 023 and 046 at december 26 2009 and december 27 2008 respectively plus an additional amount ranging from 035 to 090 per annum adjusted quarterly based on our performance 050 at both december 26 2009 and december 27 2008 we are also required to pay quarterly in arrears a commitment fee ranging from 006 to 018 based on the daily average unused portion of the credit line 010 at both december 26 2009 and december 27 2008 a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would result in approximately 111000 of additional annual interest expense and would not impact the fair market value of the longterm debt

seasonality and weather 

our business is seasonal historically our sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of each year due to the sale of seasonal products unseasonable weather excessive precipitation drought and early or late frosts may also affect our sales we believe however that the impact of adverse weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of our stores 

we experience our highest inventory and accounts payable balances during the first fiscal quarter each year for purchases of seasonal products in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during the third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the winter selling season 

business strategy 

we believe our sales and earnings growth is a result of focused execution of our business strategy which includes the following key components

we currently operate a distribution network for supplying our stores with merchandise and in fiscal 2008 our stores received approximately 64 of our merchandise through this network our six distribution centers are located in indiana georgia maryland texas nebraska and washington representing total distribution capacity of 29 million square feet this capacity increased by approximately 347000 square feet in 2008 due to an expansion of our waco texas distribution center in 2009 we are not planning any additional distribution center square footage as we concentrate on increasing the utilization of our existing space 

  3 

we manage our inbound transportation activity inhouse through the use of a webbased transportation management system we outsource the operation of our dedicated fleet to two thirdparty logistics providers and utilize several common carriers as required the thirdparty logistics providers are responsible for managing drivers and tractors contracted to us we control our transportation costs through the monitoring of transportation routes and scheduling of deliveries and backhauls while minimizing empty miles 

marketing 

we utilize an “everyday low prices” strategy to consistently offer our products at competitive prices complemented by promotions to enhance peak selling seasons we regularly monitor prices at competing stores and adjust our prices as appropriate we believe that by avoiding a “saleoriented” marketing strategy we attract customers on a regular basis rather than only in response to promotional sales 

to generate store traffic and position ourselves as a destination store we promote broad selections of merchandise primarily advertised at our regular everyday low price with printed color circulars we also run periodic special events promoted through circulars and direct mail advertising we supplement our print marketing programs and further position our brand with national cable and local television advertising in select markets due to the geographic dispersion of our stores the use of national cable advertising is generally more costeffective and additionally serves to promote our stores prior to entering a new market 

due to the relatively small size of our stores increased traffic in the store ensures increased exposure to our products our vendors are committed to helping us promote our brand and position ourselves as a destination store our vendors provide assistance with product presentation and rack design brochures pointofpurchase materials for customers’ education and product education for our employees we also receive funding through contributions and incentives on purchases to promote new stores and earn rebates from vendors on product purchases based on volume 

competition 

we operate in a competitive market the principal competitive factors include location of stores price and quality of merchandise instock consistency merchandise assortment and presentation and customer service we compete with general merchandise retailers home center retailers and other specialty and discount retailers as well as independently owned retail farm and ranch stores numerous privatelyheld regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives some of these competitors are units of national or regional chains and may have substantially greater resources and financial capacities than we do however we believe we have successfully differentiated ourselves from these entities by focusing on our specialized market niche 

management and employees 

as of december 27 2008 we employed approximately 7200 fulltime and approximately 5600 parttime employees we also employ additional parttime employees during peak periods we are not party to any collective bargaining agreements 

our store operations are organized by location into eight regions each region is led by a regional manager and the region is further organized into districts which are led by a district manager our regional and district managers store managers and other distribution and support personnel have contributed significantly to our performance we have an internal advisory board comprised of store managers this group brings a grassroots perspective to operational initiatives and generates chainwide endorsement of proposed “bestpractice” solutions additionally we are committed to a continuous improvement program called tractor value system “tvs” tvs is a commitment to provide through team member engagement a business management system that emphasizes continuous improvement by embracing change of current practices to reduce cost shorten lead times and drive innovation we have implemented numerous tvs project teams comprised of employees from all areas of our operations to evaluate key operations and implement process changes that will both improve efficiency and strengthen controls our management encourages the participation of all employees in decisionmaking regularly solicits input and suggestions from our employees and responds to the suggestions 

  4 

all of our employees participate in one of various incentive programs which provide the opportunity to receive additional compensation based upon team andor company performance we also provide our employees the opportunity to participate in an employee stock purchase plan and a 401k retirement plan we contribute to the 401k plan solely through a cash match additionally we share in the cost of health insurance provided to our employees and employees receive a discount on merchandise purchased at our stores 

we encourage a “promote from within” environment when internal resources permit we also provide internal leadership development programs designed to mentor our high potential employees for continued progress and believe we have satisfactory relationships with our employees our district managers and store managers have an average length of service of approximately five years management believes internal promotions coupled with the hiring of individuals with previous retail experience will provide the management structure necessary to support our planned store growth 

management information and control systems 

we have invested considerable resources in our management information and control systems to ensure superior customer service manage the purchase and distribution of our merchandise and improve our operating efficiencies our management information and control systems include a pointofsale system a supply chain management and replenishment system a radio frequency and voice picking system in the distribution centers a vendor purchase order control system and a merchandise presentation system these systems are integrated through an enterprise resource planning “erp” system this erp system tracks merchandise from initial order through ultimate sale and interfaces with our financial systems 

we continue to evaluate and improve the functionality of our systems to maximize their effectiveness such efforts include ongoing hardware and software evaluations and upgrades to support optimal software configurations and application performance we plan to upgrade our information technology and implement other efficiencydriving system enhancements including a new pointofsale system in 2009 these efforts are directed toward constantly improving the overall business processes and achieving the most efficient and effective use of the systems to manage our operations while ensuring a secure and reliable environment 

growth strategy 

our current and longterm growth strategy is to 1 expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores 2 enhance financial performance through samestore sales increases achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an “everyday low prices” philosophy and supported by strong customer service 3 enhance product margin through assortment management vendor management sourcing and optimization of transportation and distribution costs 4 leverage operating costs especially advertising distribution and corporate overhead 5 expand market opportunities via internet sales and 6 expand through selective acquisition as such opportunities arise to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complementary strategy to organic growth 

we have experienced considerable sales growth over the last five years with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 154 we project an increase in our unit count of approximately 8 to 9 for 2009 we believe this unit count increase will contribute substantially to our future growth the acquisition of del’s enabled us to establish an initial presence in the pacific northwest primarily in washington and develop a smaller market format 

we operated 855 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states as of december 27 2008 and have plans to open 70 to 80 stores in fiscal 2009 we have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 575 potential additional markets for new tractor supply stores excluding del’s in the united states we have slowed the growth of del’s as we refine the concept and we do not plan to open any additional del’s stores in fiscal 2009

 item 1a  risk factors 

our business faces many risks these risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur our business financial condition or results of operations may suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this form 10k 

general economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance 

our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending including discretionary spending future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels business conditions interest rates tax rates fuel and energy costs higher labor and healthcare costs the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to lowerpriced competitors a general reduction in the level of discretionary spending or shifts in consumer discretionary spending to our competitors could adversely affect our growth and profitability additionally changes in the mix of products sold to a mix with a lower overall gross margin or other increased cost of sales along with slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory could adversely affect our operations and operating results 

purchase price volatility including inflationary and deflationary pressures may adversely affect our financial performance 

although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items steel grain petroleum corn soybean and other commodities as well as transportation services moreover in the last few years energy prices have risen dramatically which has resulted in increased fuel costs for our business and utility costs for our stores while the cost of certain store products and services have decreased during the latter half of 2008 if the cost of these products and services resume their increase consumer demand may fall andor we may not be able to pass all such increases on to our customers and as a result sales andor gross margins could decline our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of inflation and deflation principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale from increased volume of purchases increasing retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality due to the competitive environment such conditions have and may continue to adversely impact our financial performance

there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to increase sales at our existing stores 

we experience fluctuations in our samestore sales which are defined as stores which have completed twelve months of sales our success depends in part upon our ability to improve sales at our existing stores various factors affect samestore sales including the general retail sales environment our ability to efficiently source and distribute products changes in our merchandise mix competition current economic conditions the timing of release of new merchandise and promotional events the success of marketing programs and weather conditions these factors may cause our samestore sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations past samestore sales are not necessarily an indication of future results and there can be no assurance that our samestore sales will not decrease in the future any failure to meet the samestore sales expectations of investors and security analysts in one or more future periods could adversely affect our results of operations and result in a reduction in the market price of our common stock 

our failure to effectively manage growth could impair our business 

even if we are able to implement to a significant degree our key business strategy of expanding our store base we may experience managerial or operational problems which may prevent any significant increase in profitability or negatively impact our cash flow to manage our planned expansion we must ensure the continuing adequacy of our existing systems controls and procedures including product distribution facilities store management financial controls and information systems there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our planned expansion that the new stores will be effectively integrated into our existing operations or that such stores will be profitable 

capital requirements for growth may not be available 

the construction and opening or acquisition of new stores and the development of new production and distribution facilities along with the remodeling and renovation of existing stores require significant amounts of capital in the past our growth has been funded primarily through bank borrowings and internally generated cash flow 

disruptions in the capital and credit markets as have been experienced during 2008 could adversely affect the ability of the banks to meet their commitments our access to funds under the credit facility is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time 

longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty changing or increased regulation reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases or other discretionary uses of cash 

failure to open new stores in the manner currently contemplated could adversely affect our financial performance 

an integral part of our business strategy includes the expansion of our base of stores by opening new stores this expansion strategy is dependent on our ability to find suitable locations and we face competition from many retailers for such sites if we are unable to implement this strategy our ability to increase our sales profitability and cash flow could be impaired significantly to the extent that we are unable to open new stores in the manner we anticipate due to site approval or unforeseen delays in construction our sales growth may be impeded 

new stores may negatively impact our results 

there can be no assurance that our new store openings will be successful or result in greater sales and profitability for the company new stores build their sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection over time and as a result generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales than our more mature stores as we continue to open new stores and the new stores become a larger percentage of our store base there may be a negative impact on our results from a lower contribution margin of these new stores until their sales levels ramp to chain average as well as the impact of related preopening costs 

competition in our industry may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations 

we operate in a very competitive market the principal competitive factors include location of stores price and quality of merchandise instock consistency merchandise assortment and presentation and customer service we believe we have successfully differentiated ourselves from general merchandise home center retailers and other specialty and discount retailers by focusing on our specialized market niche however we do face competition from these entities as well as competition from independentlyowned retail farm and ranch stores several privatelyheld regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives some of our competitors are units of national or regional chains that have substantially greater financial and other resources 

  7 

weather conditions may have a significant impact on our financial results 

historically weather conditions have had a significant impact on our operating results weather conditions affect the demand for and in some cases the supply of products which in turn has an impact on prices in recent years we have experienced unusually severe weather conditions including snow and ice storms flood and wind damage hurricanes tornadoes and droughts in some states weather conditions also directly affect the demand for seasonal products particularly during the winter heating season accordingly the weather can have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

there are certain risks associated with the seasonal nature of our business 

our working capital needs and borrowings generally peak in our first and third fiscal quarters because lower sales are generated while expenses are incurred in preparation for the spring and winter selling seasons if cash on hand and borrowings under existing credit facilities are ever insufficient to meet the seasonal needs or if cash flow generated during the spring and winter is insufficient to repay associated borrowings on a timely basis this seasonality could have a material adverse effect on our business 

there is no assurance that our merchandising initiatives and marketing emphasis will provide expected results 

we believe our past performance has been based on and future success will depend upon in part the ability to develop and execute merchandising initiatives with effective marketing there is no assurance that we will be successful or that new initiatives will be executed in a timely manner to satisfy our customers’ needs or expectations failure to execute and promote such initiatives in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow the business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition additionally our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demand and preferences for merchandise if we misjudge the market we may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to take significant inventory markdowns shortages of key items could also have a materially adverse impact on operating results 

we face risks associated with vendors from whom our products are sourced 

the products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors all of our vendors must comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting required vendor standards of conduct we rely on foreign manufacturers for various products that we sell in addition many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources we rely on longterm relationships with our suppliers but have no longterm contracts with such suppliers our future success will depend in large measure upon our ability to maintain our existing supplier relationships or to develop new ones this reliance increases the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various products due to local political economic social or environmental conditions transportation delays restrictive actions by foreign governments or changes in united states laws and regulations affecting imports or domestic distribution our vendors may be forced to reduce their production shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection which in some cases would make it difficult for us to serve the market’s needs and could have a material adverse affect on our business as an importer our business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business abroad such as foreign governmental regulations economic disruptions delays in shipments transportation capacity and costs currency exchange rates and changes in political or economic conditions in countries from which we purchase products if any such factors were to render the conduct of business in particular countries undesirable or impractical or if additional united states quotas duties taxes or other charges or restrictions were imposed upon the importation of our products in the future our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our failure to attract and retain qualified employees could adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to continue expanding operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees our ability to meet labor needs while controlling wage and related labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force unemployment levels prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation if we are unable to locate attract or retain qualified personnel or if costs of labor or related costs increase significantly our financial performance could be adversely affected 

  8 

we may be subject to product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business 

our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business we maintain general liability insurance with a 250000 deductible for each occurrence and a 29500000 aggregate retention applicable to all general liability and workers compensation claims we also maintain umbrella limits above the primary general liability and product liability cover in many cases we have indemnification rights against the manufacturers of the products and their products liability insurance our ability to recover under such insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject to the financial viability of the insurers and manufacturers and the specific allegations of a claim no assurance can be given that our insurance coverage or the manufacturers’ indemnity will be available or sufficient in any claims brought against us 

legal proceedings could materially impact our results 

from time to time we are party to legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and employment issues personal injury intellectual property and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business our results could be materially impacted by the decisions and expenses related to pending or future proceedings 

if we experience difficulties with our management information systems our financial performance may be adversely affected 

we depend on management information systems for many aspects of our business we could be materially adversely affected if our management information systems are disrupted or if we are unable to improve upgrade maintain and expand systems particularly in light of the contemplated continued store growth 

effective tax rate changes and results of examinations by taxing authorities could materially impact our results 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the earnings mix being lower than historical results in states where we have lower statutory rates and higher than historical results in states where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the internal revenue service “irs” and other state and local taxing authorities our results could be materially impacted by the determinations and expenses related to these and other proceedings by the irs and other state and local taxing authorities 

failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business and results 

the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting an internal control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the market price of our common stock

 item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

overview 

tractor supply company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the united states and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and of those who enjoy the rural lifestyle as well as tradesmen and small businesses our stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities and offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise 

 

our tractor supply stores typically range in size from 15500 square feet to 18500 square feet of inside selling space and additional outside selling space we are developing stores using several standard prototypes as well as existing building structures 

our whollyowned subsidiary del’s which operated 28 stores as of december 27 2008 primarily in the pacific northwest offers a wide selection of products primarily in the equine pet and animal category tailored to those who enjoy the rural lifestyle del’s stores currently range in size from approximately 2000 to 6000 square feet of inside selling space plus additional outside and coveredsheltered selling space 

our current and longterm growth strategy is to 1 expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores 2 enhance financial performance through samestore sales increases achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an “everyday low prices” philosophy and supported by strong customer service 3 enhance product margin through assortment management vendor management sourcing and optimization of transportation and distribution costs 4 leverage operating costs especially occupancy advertising and distribution 5 expand market opportunities via internet sales and 6 expand through selective acquisition as such opportunities arise to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complimentary strategy to organic growth 

we have experienced considerable sales growth over the last five years with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 154 we project an increase in our unit count of approximately 8 to 9 for 2009 we believe this unit count increase will contribute substantially to our future growth the acquisition of del’s enabled us to establish an initial presence in the pacific northwest primarily in washington with three additional stores in hawaii 

we operated 855 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states as of december 27 2008 and have plans to open 70 to 80 stores in fiscal 2009 we have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 575 potential additional markets for new tractor supply stores excluding del’s in the united states we have slowed the growth of del’s as we refine the concept and we do not plan to open any additional del’s stores in fiscal 2009 

the net cash investment required to open a new leased retrofit store in fiscal 2008 was between 09 to 20 million and 09 to 13 million to open a new leased prototype store the average net cash investment for new stores opened in 2008 was 12 million for retrofit stores and 10 million for prototype stores a majority of the cash outlay was for initial acquisition of inventory and capital expenditures principally leasehold improvements fixtures and equipment and approximately 107000 for preopening costs 

we have placed significant emphasis on our merchandising programs evaluating the sales and profitability of our products through detailed line reviews review of vendor performance measures and modification of the overall product offerings we believe these efforts coupled with a strong marketing program and indepth product knowledge training of our store employees have enhanced our sales and financial performance 

  16 

seasonality and weather 

our business is highly seasonal historically our sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of each year due to the sale of seasonal products unseasonable weather excessive precipitation drought and early or late frosts may also affect our sales we believe however that the impact of adverse weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of our stores 

we experience our highest inventory and accounts payable levels during our first fiscal quarter each year for purchases of seasonal product in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the winter selling season 

inflation 

although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by inflation we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items steel grain petroleum corn soybean and other commodities as well as transportation services moreover in the last few years energy prices have risen dramatically which has resulted in increased fuel costs for our business and utility costs for our stores if the cost of these products and services continues to increase consumer demand may fall andor we may not be able to pass all such increases on to our customers and as a result sales andor gross margins could decline our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of inflation principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale from increased volume of purchases increasing retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality due to the competitive environment such conditions have and may continue to adversely impact our gross margin 

significant accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our financial position andor results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates

results of operations 

our fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last saturday of the calendar year references to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ended the fiscal years ended december 27 2008 december 29 2007 and december 30 2006 contain 52 weeks 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales 

 

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

net sales increased 113 to 30079 million in fiscal 2008 from 27032 million in fiscal 2007 this increase resulted from the opening of new stores as well as a samestore sales improvement of 14 our average transaction value increased 22 to 4455 and samestore transaction value increased 13 for fiscal 2008 the samestore average daily transaction count increased 01 the average daily transaction count for the company decreased 38 to 230 the decrease is a result of the new stores opened during the year which have lower transaction volumes until their sales ramp to chain average 

samestore sales improvements of 14 compared to 34 in the prior year were strongest in core consumable categories including animal and petrelated products clothing and footwear 

in fiscal 2008 we opened 91 new stores compared to 89 new stores in fiscal 2007 relocated one store compared to 12 in fiscal 2007 and closed no stores compared to selling our only del’s store located in canada in fiscal 2007 

gross margin increased 70 to 9123 million compared to 8527 million in 2007 as a percent of sales gross margin decreased to 303 for fiscal 2008 compared to 315 for fiscal 2007 the decrease in gross margin resulted primarily from a substantial increase in the lifo provision the lifo provision increased 123 basis points from the prior year due to significant inflation increases in costs for certain commodities petroleumbased products and steel a shift in the product mix towards higher turning higher inflationary items and clearance activity 

as a percent of sales selling general and administrative “sga” expenses increased 10 basis points to 238 in fiscal 2008 from 237 in fiscal 2007 this increase was due largely to occupancy and payroll expenses relating to new stores which generally have higher costs in relation to sales volume than the chain average offset by an aggressive expense management program depreciation and amortization expense increased 189 in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 due mainly to costs associated with new stores 

net interest expense decreased 10 basis points as a percent of sales to 21 million in fiscal 2008 from 50 million in fiscal 2007 this decrease is directly related to a lower average debt balance primarily due to a reduction in stock repurchase activity in 2008 as compared to 2007 

our effective tax rate increased to 386 for fiscal 2008 compared to 379 in fiscal 2007 resulting primarily from increases in state tax rates 

as a result of the foregoing factors net income for fiscal 2008 decreased 149 to 819 million or 219 per diluted share as compared to net income of 962 million or 240 per diluted share in fiscal 2007 during 2008 we repurchased approximately 16 million shares of stock for 539 million as part of our previously announced 400 million share repurchase program in 2007 we repurchased approximately 32 million shares at a total cost of 1500 million 

  25 

fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

net sales increased 141 to 27032 million in fiscal 2007 from 23696 million in fiscal 2006 this increase resulted from the opening of new stores as well as a samestore sales improvement of 34 our average transaction value increased 11 to 4360 while samestore transaction value decreased 01 for fiscal 2007 average daily transaction count per store increased 06 to 239 and samestore transaction count increased 35 

samestore sales improvements of 34 compared to 16 in the prior year were strongest in the livestockpet and trucktowing categories but were partially offset by lower than expected performance in seasonal and hardwaretool products 

in fiscal 2007 we opened 89 new stores compared to 82 new stores in fiscal 2006 relocated 12 stores compared to 15 in fiscal 2006 and sold our only del’s store located in canada compared to one closed store in fiscal 2006 

as a percent of sales gross margin was unchanged at 315 compared with the prior year reductions in direct product costs were achieved through improved sourcing and mix of sales but were offset by slightly higher transportation costs and increased shrinkage 

as a percent of sales sga expenses increased 20 basis points to 237 in fiscal 2007 from 235 in fiscal 2006 the increase is primarily attributable to increased occupancy and payroll costs from new stores which generally have higher costs in relation to sales volume than the chain average depreciation and amortization expense increased 207 in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 due mainly to costs associated with new stores 

net interest expense increased 10 basis points as a percent of sales to 50 million in fiscal 2007 from 27 million in fiscal 2006 this increase is due largely to borrowings related to the stock repurchase program 

our effective tax rate increased to 379 for fiscal 2007 compared to 374 in fiscal 2006 resulting primarily from state taxes relating to the composition of income among the states and the adoption of fin 48 relating to uncertainties in income tax positions this interpretation prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements tax positions that meet a “morelikelythannot” recognition threshold should be measured in order to determine the tax benefit to be recognized we are no longer subject to federal examination for years before 2005 and state and local income tax examinations for years before 2002 

we adopted the provisions of fin 48 in fiscal 2007 as required as a result we charged approximately 19 million to retained earnings for the cumulative effect of adoption including interest interest and penalties were immaterial at the date of adoption the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate is 23 million in addition we recognize current interest accrued related to these uncertain tax positions as interest expense 

as a result of the foregoing factors net income for fiscal 2007 increased 58 to 962 million or 240 per diluted share compared to net income of 910 million or 222 per diluted share in fiscal 2006 during 2007 the company repurchased 32 million shares of its stock for 1500 million as part of our previously announced 400 million as amended in august 2008 share repurchase program 

liquidity and capital resources 

in addition to normal operating expenses our primary ongoing cash requirements are for expansion remodeling and relocation programs including inventory purchases and capital expenditures our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are funds provided from operations commitments available under our revolving credit agreement capital and operating leases and normal trade credit our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the spring and winter selling seasons respectively 

  26 

working capital 

at december 27 2008 we had working capital of 2835 million a 286 million decrease from december 29 2007 this decrease was primarily attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities in millions 

 

the decrease in inventories resulted primarily from a decrease in average inventory per store due to planned inventory management initiatives to reduce inventory levels coupled with more aggressive clearance efforts the accounts payable increase is due to improved vendor financing trade credit arises from our vendors granting extended payment terms for inventory purchases payment terms generally vary from 30 days to 180 days depending on the inventory product we experienced an increase in our financed inventory from approximately 383 in 2007 to 430 in 2008 the calculated financed inventory assumes average inventory excludes intransit inventories and includes only unopened stores with significant inventory 

borrowings and credit facilities 

on february 22 2007 we entered into a new senior credit facility with bank of america na as agent for a lender group the “credit agreement” allowing us to borrow up to 250 million with sublimits of 75 million and 10 million for letters of credit and swingline loans respectively the credit agreement is unsecured and has a five year term with proceeds expected to be used for working capital capital expenditures and share repurchases 

in february 2008 we exercised the increase option on our credit agreement increasing the overall capacity from 250 million to 350 million each of the nine lenders within our credit agreement bank group participated in the increase simultaneously definitions within the credit agreement were modified as follows 1 added an additional increase option for 150 million subject to additional lender group commitments 2 modified the definition of swingline committed amount from 10 million to 20 million and 3 revised the definition of the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant to remove certain defined fixed charges all pricing terms and the term of the facility remained the same 

at december 27 2008 there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and there were 550 million in borrowings outstanding at december 29 2007 there were an additional 251 million and 250 million outstanding letters of credit as of december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 respectively borrowings bear interest at either the bank’s base rate 325 at december 27 2008 or the london interbank offer rate “libor” 046 at december 27 2008 plus an additional amount ranging from 035 to 090 per annum adjusted quarterly based on our performance 050 at december 27 2008 we are also required to pay quarterly in arrears a commitment fee ranging from 006 to 018 per annum and adjusted quarterly based on our performance for unused capacity 010 at december 27 2008 there are no compensating balance requirements associated with the credit agreement 

the credit agreement contains certain restrictions regarding additional indebtedness capital expenditures business operations guarantees investments mergers consolidations and sales of assets transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates and liens the credit agreement requires quarterly compliance with respect to fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios we were in compliance with all covenants at december 27 2008

sources and uses of cash 

our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures and financing activities are payments on debt and repurchase of the company’s common stock the following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years in millions 

 

operating activities 

the 624 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities in millions 

 

the improvement in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 was primarily due to changes in inventory levels and the timing of payments inventory levels decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to an increased focus on inventory management in 2008 additionally we achieved an increase in financed inventory to 430 in 2008 from 383 in 2007 resulting in an increase in accounts payable while decreasing inventory 

the 675 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities in millions 

 

the improvement in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 was primarily due to changes in inventory levels and the timing of payments inventory levels increased less in 2007 compared to 2006 due to the timing of imports and a focus on inventory management in 2007 additionally we achieved a slight increase in financed inventory resulting in a higher increase in accounts payable relative to inventory the change in cash used for income taxes relates to the timing of quarterly payments caused by annualized proration requirements 

  28 

investing activities 

investing activities used 884 million 826 million and 808 million in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the majority of this cash requirement relates to our capital expenditures 

our significant store expansion coupled with required investment in infrastructure resulted in the following capital expenditures including capital leases in millions 

 

our longterm growth strategy anticipates continued geographic market expansion and further concentration within existing markets this growth will also require continuing investment in information technology and people the costs reflected above are typically building improvements as we lease the majority of our facilities we currently estimate that capital expenditures will range between 95 million and 100 million in fiscal 2009 while we plan to open fewer stores in 2009 we expect to replace those investments with store refurbishment an upgrade in it hardware and other efficiencydriving system enhancements in 2009 

financing activities 

financing activities used 1055 million used 851 million and provided 101 million in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2008 is mainly the result of share repurchase activity and net repayments under the senior credit facility 

we have a boardapproved share repurchase program which provides for repurchase of up to 400 million of common stock exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses related to such repurchases through december 2011 in august 2008 the board of directors authorized a 200 million increase to the existing 200 million share repurchase program and extended the program term from february 2010 to december 2011 the repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions the timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors including price corporate and regulatory requirements capital availability and other market conditions repurchased shares will be held in treasury the program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice as of december 27 2008 we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of 1962 million exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses 

we repurchased approximately 16 million and 32 million shares at a total cost of 539 million and 1500 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance 

we believe that our cash flow from operations borrowings available under the credit agreement and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs including store openings relocations and renovations over the next several years 

significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of december 27 2008 in thousands 

 

 

 the company had outstanding standby letters of credit of 251 million as of december 27 2008 

  29 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements consist of operating leases and outstanding letters of credit the balances for these arrangements are discussed above we typically lease buildings for retail stores and offices rather than acquiring these assets which allows us to utilize financial capital to operate the business rather than invest in fixed assets letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory primarily sourced overseas and support certain risk management programs in a timely manner 

recent accounting pronouncements 

fair value measurements in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas 157” sfas 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and expands disclosures about fair value measurements in february 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position no fas 1572 “effective date of fasb statement no 157” “fsp 1572” which amended sfas 157 and delayed its effective date for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis that is at least annually fsp 1572 defers the effective date of sfas 157 to fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of fsp 1572 the adoption of sfas 157 and fsp 1572 did not impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

in october 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position no fas 1573 determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active this fsp clarifies the application of statement no 157 in an inactive market the fasb also issued a joint press release with the office of the chief accountant of the sec on september 30 2008 that addresses similar guidance to what is contained in fsp fas 1573 the guidance in these two releases clarifies that observable transactions in inactive markets may not be indicative of fair value and in such instances the use of a reporting entity’s own assumptions about future cash flows and appropriately riskadjusted discount rates may provide a better estimate of an asset’s fair value the application of this guidance did not have an impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” “sfas 159” sfas 159 allows entities the option to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value as of specified dates such election which may be applied on an instrument by instrument basis is typically irrevocable once elected we adopted sfas 159 effective december 30 2007 fiscal 2008 the adoption of sfas 159 did not impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

business combinations 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 business combinations “sfas 141r” which replaces sfas no 141 business combinations “sfas 141” issued in 2001  whereas its predecessor applied only to business combinations in which control was obtained by transferring consideration the revised standard applies to all transactions or other events in which one entity obtains control over another sfas 141r defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control over one or more other businesses and defines the acquisition date as the date the acquirer achieves control sfas 141r requires the acquirer to recognize assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date the revised standard changes the treatment of acquisitionrelated costs restructuring costs related to an acquisition that the acquirer expects but is not obligated to incur contingent consideration associated with the purchase price and preacquisition contingencies associated with acquired assets and liabilities sfas 141r retains the guidance in sfas 141 for identifying and recognizing intangible assets apart from goodwill the revised standard applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2008 thus we will be required to apply the provisions of sfas 141r to any business acquisition which occurs on or after december 28 2008 but this standard will have no effect on prior acquisitions 

  30 

determination of the useful life of intangible assets 

in april 2008 the fasb issued fsp no fas 1423 “determination of the useful life of intangible assets” which amends the factors that must be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life over which to amortize the cost of a recognized intangible asset under sfas 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” the fsp requires an entity to consider its own assumptions about renewal or extension of the term of the arrangement consistent with its expected use of the asset and is an attempt to improve consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas 141 “business combinations” the fsp is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and the guidance for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date the fsp is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles in may 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 162 “the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles” “sfas 162” the statement is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent hierarchy for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are prepared in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles sfas 162 was effective november 15 2008 and did not have any impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flow 




 i tem 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from the credit agreement the credit agreement bears interest at either the bank’s base rate 325 and 725 at december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 respectively or libor 046 and 486 at december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 respectively plus an additional amount ranging from 035 to 090 per annum adjusted quarterly based on our performance 050 at both december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 we are also required to pay quarterly in arrears a commitment fee ranging from 006 to 018 based on the daily average unused portion of the credit line 010 at both december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would result in approximately 535000 of additional annual interest expense and would not impact the fair market value of the longterm debt

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we carried out an evaluation required by the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “1934 act” under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e of the 1934 act as of december 27 2008 based on this evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of december 27 2008 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the 1934 act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the 1934 act the company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 27 2008 in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control  integrated framework based on this assessment management believes that as of december 27 2008 the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria 

ernst  young llp the independent registered public accounting firm which also audited the company’s consolidated financial statements has issued a report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting which is included herein 

change in internal control over financial reporting 

on january 16 2009 we identified a material weakness in internal controls related to the lifo inventory valuation for each of the first three fiscal quarters of fiscal 2008 the actual lifo valuation is dependent upon endofyear inventories specifically the quantity and mix of product and the inflation rate for the various categories of products since the actual valuation can only be calculated at yearend we record an estimated lifo provision at the end of each interim quarter at yearend when the key variables are known the lifo provision is adjusted to the actual yearend calculation 

we developed a new interim lifo projection model at the beginning of fiscal 2008 in an effort to facilitate improved forecasting of both inventory mix and price inflation at the end of fiscal 2008 an error was discovered in the lifo projection model which resulted in an understatement of the inflation indices as a result the quarterly lifo provision to cost of merchandise sold for each of the first three fiscal quarters of fiscal 2008 was understated 

  54 

notes to consolidated financial statements 

we did not have a sufficient review process for the new model used to forecast expected inflationdeflation among the product categories which led to a material misstatement of our interim financial statements for each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2008 we determined that this was a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting in order to remediate this material weakness we have taken the following steps 

 

based on the implementation of the above steps we have determined that the material weakness related to the interim lifo process has been remedied as of december 27 2008

seasonality and weather 

our business is highly seasonal historically our sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of each year due to the sale of seasonal products unseasonable weather excessive precipitation natural disasters drought and early or late frosts may also affect our sales we believe however that the impact of severe weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of our stores 

we experience our highest inventory and accounts payable levels during the first fiscal quarter each year for purchases of seasonal products in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during the third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the winter selling season 

business strategy 

we believe our sales and earnings growth is a result of focused execution of our business strategy which includes the following key components 

market niche 

we have identified a specialized market niche supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle which we refer to as the “ out here ” lifestyle as well as tradesmen and small businesses by focusing our product mix on these core customers we believe we are differentiated from general merchandise home center and other specialty retailers 

  1 

customer service

in fiscal 2007 we established our first online shopping site tractorsupplycom  the availability of many of our products online provides our customers the ability to purchase products and have them shipped to their homes or offices this capability further enhances customer service and extends our market to areas where retail stores are not currently located 

we offer proprietary private label credit cards for individual retail and business customers in addition we accept cash checks debit cards visa mastercard and discover credit cards and gift cards 

store environment 

our stores are designed and managed to make shopping an enjoyable experience and to maximize sales and operating efficiencies stores utilize several layouts designed to provide an open environment optimal product placement and visual display locations in addition these layouts allow for departmental space to be easily reallocated and visual displays to be easily changed for seasonal products and promotions display and product placement information is sent to stores monthly to ensure quality and uniformity among the stores informative signs are located throughout each store to assist customers with purchasing decisions and merchandise location by comparison of “good better best” qualities clear pricing and useful information regarding product benefits and suggestions for appropriate accessories the general uniformity of our store layouts and visual displays afford our customers a feeling of familiarity and enhances the shopping experience to further enhance the shopping experience all of our store employees wear highly visible red vests aprons or smocks and nametags and our customer service and checkout counters are conveniently located 

merchandising

  2 

 

additionally we have access to control brands which we market these control brands include morgan creek “lifestyle clothing” and farm hand air compressors we believe that the availability of top quality private label products at great prices provides superior value for our customers a strategic advantage for us and positions us as a “destination” store 

the following chart indicates the average percentages of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

 

 purchasing and distribution 

we offer a differentiated assortment of products for those seeking to enjoy the “ out here ” lifestyle our business is not dependent upon any one vendor or particular group of vendors we purchase our products from a core group of approximately 850 vendors with no one vendor representing more than 10 of our purchases during fiscal 2007 approximately 200 vendors accounted for approximately 80 of our purchases during fiscal 2007 we have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative sources of supply for our products and we believe that adequate sources of supply exist at substantially similar costs for substantially all of our products we have no material longterm contractual commitments with any of our vendors 

we maintain a dedicated supply chain management team to focus exclusively on all replenishment and forecasting functions this centralized direction permits our buying teams to focus more strategic attention toward vendor line reviews assortment planning and testing of new products and programs through the combined efforts of these teams we expect to improve overall inventory productivity and instock position 

over 98 of our purchase orders are transmitted through an electronic data interchange “edi” system and approximately 91 of merchandise vendor invoices are transmitted through edi we are expanding the percentage of vendors who electronically transmit invoices and increasing the amount of sales history transmitted 

  3 

we currently operate a distribution network for supplying our stores with merchandise and in fiscal 2007 our stores received approximately 78 of our merchandise through this network our six distribution centers are located in indiana georgia maryland texas nebraska and washington representing total distribution capacity of 26 million square feet this capacity increased by approximately 145000 square feet in 2007 due to an expansion of our georgia distribution center and relocation of our washington distribution center in 2008 we have begun planning a 347000 square foot expansion of our waco texas distribution facility as we continue to expand in the western us we expect to establish facilities in that general area to support growth and further leverage transportation and distribution costs 

we manage our inbound and outbound transportation activity inhouse through the use of a webbased transportation management system we outsource the management of our dedicated fleets to two thirdparty logistics providers and utilize several common carriers as required the thirdparty logistics providers are responsible for providing drivers and tractors dedicated to transporting merchandise for us we endeavor to control our transportation costs through the monitoring of transportation routes scheduling of deliveries backhauls and optimal utilization of the dedicated fleet of trucks and trailers 

marketing 

we utilize an “everyday low prices” strategy to consistently offer our products at competitive prices complimented by promotions to enhance peak selling seasons we regularly monitor prices at competing stores and adjust our prices as we deem appropriate we believe that by avoiding a “saleoriented” marketing strategy we attract customers on a regular basis rather than only in response to promotional sales 

to generate store traffic and position ourselves as a destination store we promote broad selections of merchandise primarily advertised at our regular everyday low price with printed color circulars we also run periodic special events promoted through circulars and direct mail advertising we supplement our print marketing programs and further position our brand with national cable and local television advertising in select markets due to the geographic dispersion of our stores the use of national cable advertising is generally more costeffective and additionally serves to promote our stores prior to entering a new market 

due to the relatively small size of our stores increased traffic in the store ensures increased exposure to our products our vendors are committed to helping us promote our brand and position ourselves as a destination store our vendors provide assistance with product presentation and rack design brochures pointofpurchase materials for customers’ education and product education for our employees we also receive funding through contributions and incentives on purchases to promote new and relocated stores and earn rebates from vendors on product purchases based on volume 

competition 

we operate in a very competitive market the principal competitive factors include location of stores price and quality of merchandise instock consistency merchandise assortment and presentation and customer service we compete with general merchandise retailers home center retailers and other specialty and discount retailers as well as independently owned retail farm and ranch stores numerous privatelyheld regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives some of these competitors are units of national or regional chains and may have substantially greater resources and financial capacities than we do however we believe we have successfully differentiated ourselves from these entities by focusing on our specialized market niche 

management and employees 

as of december 29 2007 we employed approximately 6900 fulltime and approximately 4700 parttime employees we also employ additional parttime employees during peak periods we are not party to any collective bargaining agreements 

  4 

our store operations are organized by location into seven regions each region is led by a regional manager and the region is further organized into districts which are led by a district manager our regional and district managers store managers and other distribution and support personnel have contributed significantly to our performance we have an internal advisory board comprised of store managers this group brings a grassroots perspective to operational initiatives and generates chainwide endorsement of proposed “bestpractice” solutions we have implemented numerous best practice teams comprised of employees from all areas of our operations to evaluate our key operations and recommend process changes that will both improve efficiency and strengthen controls our management encourages the participation of all employees in decisionmaking regularly solicits input and suggestions from our employees and responds to the suggestions additionally we are committed to a continuous improvement program called tractor value system “tvs” tvs is a commitment to provide through team member engagement a business management system that emphasizes continuous improvement by embracing change of current practices to reduce cost shorten lead times and drive innovation 

all of our employees participate in one of various incentive programs which provide the opportunity to receive additional compensation based upon team andor company performance we also provide our employees the opportunity to participate in an employee stock purchase plan and a 401k retirement plan we contribute to the 401k plan solely through a cash match additionally we share in the cost of health insurance provided to our employees and employees receive a discount on merchandise purchased at our stores 

we encourage a “promote from within” environment when internal resources permit we also provide internal leadership development programs designed to mentor our high potential employees for continued progress and believe we have satisfactory relationships with our employees our district managers and store managers have an average length of service of approximately five years management believes internal promotions coupled with the hiring of individuals with previous retail experience will provide the management structure necessary to support our planned store growth 

management information and control systems 

we have invested considerable resources in our management information and control systems to ensure superior customer service manage the purchase and distribution of our merchandise and improve our operating efficiencies our management information and control systems include a pointofsale system a supply chain management and replenishment system a radio frequency picking system in the distribution centers a vendor purchase order control system and a merchandise presentation system these systems are integrated through an enterprise resource planning erp system this erp system tracks merchandise from initial order through ultimate sale and interfaces with our financial systems 

we continue to evaluate and improve the functionality of our systems to maximize their effectiveness such efforts include an ongoing evaluation of the optimal software configuration including system enhancements and upgrades as well as the adequacy of the underlying hardware components these efforts are directed toward constantly improving the overall business processes and achieving the most efficient and effective use of the systems to manage our operations 

growth strategy 

our current and longterm growth strategy is to 1 expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores 2 enhance financial performance through samestore sales increases achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an “everyday low prices” philosophy and supported by strong customer service 3 enhance product margin through assortment management vendor management sourcing and optimization of transportation and distribution costs 4 leverage operating costs especially occupancy advertising and distribution 5 expand market opportunities via internet sales and 6 expand through selective acquisition as such opportunities arise to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complementary strategy to organic growth 

we have experienced considerable sales growth over the last five years with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 174 we plan to continue our growth strategy which anticipates an annual increase in our unit count of approximately 13 this growth has expanded our market presence to 764 retail stores in 43 states we believe this unit count increase will contribute substantially to our future growth we have also relocated 83 stores since 2002 which enabled us to keep much of our existing loyal customer base but expand our overall reach to new customers thereby growing the business we believe we have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 650 potential additional markets for new tractor supply stores excluding del’s in the united states we continue to develop our site selection methodology for the del’s concept which includes tests in markets of varying size and demographics 

  5 

we expect to open approximately 95 to 100 stores including eight to 10 del’s stores in fiscal 2008 

the average estimated net cash investment required to open a new leased retrofit or prototype store in fiscal 2007 was between 08 to 14 million and 07 to 09 million respectively a majority of the cash outlay was for initial acquisition of inventory and capital expenditures principally leasehold improvements fixtures and equipment and approximately 95000 for preopening costs

 item 1a  risk factors 

our business faces many risks these risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur our business financial condition or results of operations may suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this form 10k 

general economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance 

our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending including discretionary spending future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels business conditions interest rates tax rates fuel and energy costs higher labor and healthcare costs the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to lowerpriced competitors a general reduction in the level of discretionary spending or shifts in consumer discretionary spending to our competitors could adversely affect our growth and profitability additionally changes in the mix of products sold to a mix with a lower overall gross margin or other increased cost of sales along with slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory could adversely affect our operations and operating results 

inflationary pressures including rising energy prices may adversely affect our financial performance 

although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations have been affected by inflation we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items steel grain petroleum corn soybean and other commodities as well as transportation services moreover in the last few years energy prices have risen dramatically which has resulted in increased fuel costs for our business and utility costs for our stores we have been successful in reducing or mitigating the effects of inflation principally through selective buying from the most competitive vendors and by increasing retail prices however there is no assurance that we will be successful in reducing or mitigating the effect of inflation in the future 

  6 

there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to increase sales at our existing stores 

we experience fluctuations in our samestore sales which are defined as stores which have completed twelve months of sales excluding relocated stores our success depends in part upon our ability to improve sales at our existing stores various factors affect samestore sales including the general retail sales environment our ability to efficiently source and distribute products changes in our merchandise mix competition current economic conditions the timing of release of new merchandise and promotional events the success of marketing programs and weather conditions these factors may cause our samestore sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations past samestore sales are not necessarily an indication of future results and there can be no assurance that our samestore sales will not decrease in the future any failure to meet the samestore sales expectations of investors and security analysts in one or more future periods could adversely affect our results of operations and result in a reduction in the market price of our common stock 

our failure to effectively manage growth could impair our business 

even if we are able to implement to a significant degree our key business strategy of expanding our store base we may experience managerial or operational problems which may prevent any significant increase in profitability or negatively impact our cash flow to manage our planned expansion we must ensure the continuing adequacy of our existing systems controls and procedures including product distribution facilities store management financial controls and information systems there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our planned expansion that the new stores will be effectively integrated into our existing operations or that such stores will be profitable 

capital requirements for growth may not be available 

the construction and opening or acquisition of new stores and the development of new production and distribution facilities along with the remodeling and renovation of existing stores require significant amounts of capital in the past our growth has been funded primarily through bank borrowings and internally generated cash flow 

failure to open new stores in the manner currently contemplated could adversely affect our financial performance 

an integral part of our business strategy includes the expansion of our base of stores by opening new stores this expansion strategy is dependent on our ability to find suitable locations and we face competition from many retailers for such sites if we are unable to implement this strategy our ability to increase our sales profitability and cash flow could be impaired significantly to the extent that we are unable to open new stores in the manner we anticipate due to site approval or unforeseen delays in construction our sales growth may be impeded 

new stores may negatively impact our results 

there can be no assurance that our new store openings will be successful or result in greater sales and profitability for the company new stores build their sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection over time and as a result generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales than our more mature stores as we accelerate our rate of new store openings thus increasing the percentage of our sales from new stores and decreasing the average age of our store base there may be a negative impact on our results from a lower contribution of these new stores along with the impact of related preopening costs 

competition in our industry may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations 

we operate in a very competitive market the principal competitive factors include location of stores price and quality of merchandise instock consistency merchandise assortment and presentation and customer service we believe we have successfully differentiated ourselves from general merchandise home center retailers and other specialty and discount retailers by focusing on our specialized market niche however we do face competition from these entities as well as competition from independentlyowned retail farm and ranch stores several privatelyheld regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives some of our competitors are units of national or regional chains that have substantially greater financial and other resources 

weather conditions may have a significant impact on our financial results 

historically weather conditions have had a significant impact on our operating results weather conditions affect the demand for and in some cases the supply of products which in turn has an impact on prices in recent years we have experienced unusually severe weather conditions including ice storms floods and wind damage hurricanes and droughts in some states weather conditions also directly affect the demand for petroleum products particularly during the winter heating season accordingly the weather can have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  7 

there are certain risks associated with the seasonal nature of our business 

our working capital needs and borrowings generally peak in our first fiscal quarter because lower sales are generated while expenses are incurred in preparation for the spring selling season if cash on hand and borrowings under existing credit facilities are ever insufficient to meet the seasonal needs or if cash flow generated during the spring and summer is insufficient to repay associated borrowings on a timely basis this seasonality could have a material adverse effect on our business 

there is no assurance that our merchandising initiatives and marketing emphasis will continue 

we believe our past performance has been based on and future success will depend upon in part the ability to develop and execute merchandising initiatives with effective marketing there is no assurance that we will be successful or that new initiatives will be executed in a timely manner to satisfy our customers’ needs or expectations failure to execute and promote such initiatives in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow the business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition additionally our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demand and preferences for merchandise if we misjudge the market we may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to take significant inventory markdowns shortages of key items could also have a materially adverse impact on operating results 

we face risks associated with vendors from whom our products are sourced 

the products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors all of our vendors must comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting required vendor standards of conduct we rely on foreign manufacturers for various products that we sell in addition many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources we rely on longterm relationships with our suppliers but have no longterm contracts with such suppliers our future success will depend in large measure upon our ability to maintain our existing supplier relationships or to develop new ones this reliance increases the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various products due to local political economic social or environmental conditions transportation delays restrictive actions by foreign governments or changes in united states laws and regulations affecting imports or domestic distribution as an importer our business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business abroad such as foreign governmental regulations economic disruptions delays in shipments transportation capacity and costs currency exchange rates and changes in political or economic conditions in countries from which we purchase products if any such factors were to render the conduct of business in particular countries undesirable or impractical or if additional united states quotas duties taxes or other charges or restrictions were imposed upon the importation of our products in the future our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our failure to attract and retain qualified employees could adversely affect our financial performance 

our ability to continue expanding operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees our ability to meet labor needs while controlling wage and related labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force unemployment levels prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation if we are unable to locate attract or retain qualified personnel or if costs of labor or related costs increase significantly our financial performance could be adversely affected 

we may be subject to product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business 

our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business we maintain general liability insurance with a 250000 deductible for each occurrence and a 25000000 aggregate retention we also maintain umbrella limits above the primary general liability and product liability cover in many cases we have indemnification rights against the manufacturers of the products and their products liability insurance our ability to recover under such insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject to the financial viability of the insurers and manufacturers and the specific allegations of a claim we cannot assure that our insurance coverage or the manufacturers’ indemnity will be available or sufficient in any claims brought against us 

legal proceedings could materially impact our results 

from time to time we are party to legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and employment issues personal injury intellectual property and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business our results could be materially impacted by the decisions and expenses related to pending or future proceedings 

  8 

if we experience difficulties with our management information systems our financial performance may be adversely affected 

we depend on management information systems for many aspects of our business we could be materially adversely affected if our management information systems are disrupted or if we are unable to improve upgrade maintain and expand systems particularly in light of the contemplated continued store growth 

effective tax rate changes and results of examinations by taxing authorities could materially impact our results 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the earnings mix being lower than historical results in states where we have lower statutory rates and higher than historical results in states where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the internal revenue service “irs” and other state and local taxing authorities our results could be materially impacted by the determinations and expenses related to these and other proceedings by the irs and other state and local taxing authorities 

failure of our internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business and results 

the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting an internal control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the market price of our common stock

 item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

tractor supply company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the united states and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and of those who enjoy the rural lifestyle as well as tradesmen and small businesses our stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities and offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise 

 

tractor supply company stores typically range in size from 15500 to 18500 square feet of inside selling space plus additional outside selling space we are developing stores using one of five standard prototypes as well as existing building structures our whollyowned subsidiary del’s farm supply llc “del’s” operates 23 stores primarily in the pacific northwest that offer a wide selection of products primarily in the equine pet and animal category tailored to those who enjoy the rural lifestyle del’s stores currently range in size from approximately 1500 to 5000 square feet of inside selling space plus additional outside and coveredsheltered selling space 

our current and longterm growth strategy is to 1 expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores 2 enhance financial performance through samestore sales increases achieved through aggressive merchandising programs with an “everyday low prices” philosophy and supported by strong customer service 3 enhance product margin through assortment management vendor management sourcing and optimization of transportation and distribution costs 4 leverage operating costs especially occupancy advertising and distribution 5 expand market opportunities via internet sales and 6 expand through selective acquisition as such opportunities arise to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complimentary strategy to organic growth 

we have experienced considerable sales growth over the last five years with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 174 we plan to continue this growth strategy with an annual projected increase in our unit count of approximately 13 this growth has expanded our market presence to 764 stores in 43 states we believe this unit count increase will contribute substantially to our future growth the acquisition of del’s enabled us to establish an initial presence in the pacific northwest primarily in washington with three additional stores in hawaii 

we operated 764 retail farm and ranch stores as of december 29 2007 and have plans to open 95 to 100 stores including eight to 10 del’s stores in fiscal 2008 we have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 650 potential additional markets for new tractor supply stores excluding del’s in the united states 

we have placed significant emphasis on our merchandising programs evaluating the sales and profitability of our products through detailed line reviews review of vendor performance measures and modification of the overall product offerings these efforts coupled with a strong marketing program and indepth product knowledge training of our store employees have enhanced our sales and financial performance 

seasonality and weather 

our business is highly seasonal historically our sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of each year due to the sale of seasonal products unseasonable weather excessive precipitation natural disasters drought and early or late frosts may also affect our sales we believe however that the impact of adverse weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of our stores 

we experience our highest inventory and accounts payable levels during our first fiscal quarter each year for purchases of seasonal product in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the winter selling season 

  16 

inflation 

although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by inflation we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items steel grain petroleum corn soybean and other commodities as well as transportation services moreover in the last few years energy prices have risen dramatically which has resulted in increased fuel costs for our business and utility costs for our stores we have been successful in reducing or mitigating the effects of inflation principally through selective buying from the most competitive vendors and by increasing retail prices however there is no assurance that we will be successful in reducing or mitigating the effect of inflation in the future 

significant accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our financial position andor results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 

  description  

revenue recognition and sales returns 

we recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services if we receive payment before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise as per our layaway program the revenue is deferred until the sale is complete revenues from the sale of gift cards are deferred and recognized upon redemption 

  judgments and uncertainties  

we estimate a liability for sales returns based on a oneyear rolling average of historical return trends and we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns associated with past sales our estimation methodologies have been consistently applied from year to year however as with any estimates refunds activity may vary from estimated amounts 

we recognize a benefit for gift cards when i the gift card or merchandise return card is redeemed by the customer or ii the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote referred to as “breakage” or iii the unredeemed merchandise returns cards expire one year from issuance the gift card breakage rate is based upon historical redemption patterns and a benefit is recognized for unredeemed gift cards in proportion to those historical redemption patterns 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize sales returns in the financial periods presented 

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate sales returns or gift card breakage however if actual consumer return or gift card redemption patterns are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

a 10 change in our sales return reserve at december 29 2007 would have affected net earnings by approximately 190000 in fiscal 2007 

a 10 change in our assumptions regarding gift card breakage would have affected net earnings by approximately 225000 in fiscal 2007

quarterly financial data 

our unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2007 and 2006 are shown below dollars in thousands except per share amounts

results of operations 

our fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last saturday of the calendar year references to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ended the fiscal year ended december 31 2005 contains 53 weeks while the fiscal years ended december 29 2007 and december 30 2006 contain 52 weeks 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales 

 

fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

net sales increased 141 to 27032 million in fiscal 2007 from 23696 million in fiscal 2006 this increase resulted from the opening of new stores as well as a samestore sales improvement of 34 our average transaction value increased 11 to 4360 while samestore transaction value decreased 01 for fiscal 2007 average daily transaction count per store increased 06 to 239 and samestore transaction count increased 35 

samestore sales improvements of 34 compared to 16 in the prior year were strongest in the livestockpet and trucktowing categories but were partially offset by lower than expected performance in seasonal and hardwaretool products 

in fiscal 2007 we opened 89 new stores compared to 82 new stores in fiscal 2006 relocated 12 stores compared to 15 in fiscal 2006 and sold our only del’s store located in canada compared to one closed store in fiscal 2006 

as a percent of sales gross margin was unchanged at 315 compared with the prior year reductions in direct product costs were achieved through improved sourcing and mix of sales but were offset by slightly higher transportation costs and increased shrinkage 

as a percent of sales selling general and administrative “sga” expenses increased 20 basis points to 237 in fiscal 2007 from 235 in fiscal 2006 the increase is primarily attributable to increased occupancy and payroll costs from new stores which generally have higher costs in relation to sales volume than the chain average depreciation and amortization expense increased 207 in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 due mainly to costs associated with new stores 

net interest expense increased 10 basis points as a percent of sales to 50 million in fiscal 2007 from 27 million in fiscal 2006 this increase is due largely to borrowings related to the stock repurchase program 

our effective tax rate was 379 for fiscal 2007 compared to 374 in fiscal 2006 resulting primarily from state taxes relating to the composition of income among the states and the adoption of fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” “fin 48” relating to uncertainties in income tax positions this interpretation prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements tax positions that meet a “morelikelythannot” recognition threshold should be measured in order to determine the tax benefit to be recognized we are no longer subject to federal examination for years before 2005 and state and local income tax examinations for years before 2002 

we adopted the provisions of fin 48 in fiscal 2007 as required as a result we charged approximately 19 million to retained earnings for the cumulative effect of adoption including interest interest and penalties were immaterial at the date of adoption the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate is 23 million in addition we recognize current interest accrued related to these uncertain tax positions as interest expense

as a result of the foregoing factors net income for fiscal 2007 increased 58 to 962 million or 240 per diluted share compared to net income of 910 million or 222 per diluted share in fiscal 2006 during 2007 the company repurchased 32 million shares of its stock for 1500 million as part of our previously announced 200 million share repurchase program 

fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

net sales increased 146 to 23696 million in fiscal 2006 from 20680 million in fiscal 2005 fiscal 2005 included an additional week of sales which impacted the current year sales increase by 15 this increase resulted from the opening of new stores as well as a samestore sales improvement of 16 our average transaction value increased 26 to 4312 and samestore transaction value increased 08 for fiscal 2006 average daily transaction count per store decreased 29 to 238 while samestore transaction count increased 07 

samestore sales improvements of 16 compared to 57 in the prior year were strongest in the clothingfootwear and equinepetanimal categories but were partially offset by lower than expected performance in seasonal power equipment generators and cold weatherrelated products including insulated outerwear snow removal and heating 

in fiscal 2006 we opened 82 new stores compared to 65 new stores and the acquisition of 16 del’s stores in fiscal 2005 relocated 15 stores compared to 18 in fiscal 2005 and closed one store compared to one closure in fiscal 2005 

as a percent of sales gross margin increased 80 basis points to 317 for fiscal 2006 from 309 for fiscal 2005 gross margin was primarily impacted by a more favorable product mix increased importing and improved inventory shrinkage 

during the year we refined our method of estimating the freight cost component of inventory based on changes in our business and operating environment which included a change in mix of goods an increased level of importing and rapidly increasing fuel costs this refinement provides a more appropriate matching of freight cost incurred with inventory and cost of merchandise sold this change in estimate increased the inventory value and reduced the freight component of cost of merchandise sold by approximately 29 million for fiscal 2006 

as a percent of sales selling general and administrative expenses increased 90 basis points to 235 in fiscal 2006 from 226 in fiscal 2005 the increase is primarily attributable to increased occupancy costs and a charge of 97 million or 04 of sales related to stock compensation expense 

during the year we refined our method of estimating the amount of gift cards sold that will ultimately go unredeemed our estimate was based on an analysis of gift card sale and redemption patterns across an extended historical timeline we accordingly recognized a benefit of 24 million and 03 million in fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively of the 24 million recognized in fiscal 2006 21 million or 01 of sales was due to a modification of the redemption assumptions based on an analysis of historical redemption patterns this benefit has been included as a reduction in selling general and administrative expenses and is reflected as a reduction of other accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

effective january 1 2006 we adopted sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” using the modified prospective method and began recognizing compensation expense for sharebased payments based on the fair value of the awards sharebased payments include stock option grants and certain transactions under our other stock plans sfas 123r requires sharebased compensation expense recognized since the beginning of fiscal 2006 to be based on the following a grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas 123 for unvested options granted prior to the adoption date b grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas 123r for all sharebased payments granted subsequent to the adoption date and c the discount on shares sold to employees postadoption which represents the difference between the grant date fair value and the employee purchase price 

for fiscal 2006 the adoption of the sfas 123r fair value method resulted in additional compensation expense a component of selling general and administrative expenses related to our stock plans that we would not have recognized had we continued to account for sharebased compensation under accounting principles board opinion no 25 

  25 

“accounting for stock issued to employees” “apb 25” for fiscal 2006 this sharebased compensation expense lowered pretax income by 97 million and net income by 61 million 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 243 in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 due mainly to costs associated with new and relocated stores and remodeled existing stores 

net interest expense increased 647 in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005 this increase is primarily due to higher average interest rates in fiscal 2006 and interest incurred as the result of federal and sales tax audits partially offset by a reduction in average longterm borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 

our effective tax rate was 374 for fiscal 2006 compared to 365 in fiscal 2005 resulting primarily from a higher effective income tax rate due to the nondeductibility of certain stock compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas123r 

as a result of the foregoing factors net income for fiscal 2006 increased 62 to 910 million or 222 per diluted share which includes a 97 million charge or 015 per diluted share in stock compensation expense this compares to net income of 857 million or 209 per diluted share in fiscal 2005 

liquidity and capital resources 

in addition to normal operating expenses our primary ongoing cash requirements are for expansion remodeling and relocation programs including inventory purchases and capital expenditures our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are funds provided from operations commitments available under our revolving credit agreement capital and operating leases and normal trade credit our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the spring and winter selling seasons respectively 

working capital 

at december 29 2007 we had working capital of 3121 million a 40 million decrease from december 30 2006 this decrease was primarily attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities in millions 

 

the increase in inventories and related increase in accounts payable resulted primarily from the purchase of inventory for new stores trade credit arises from our vendors granting extended payment terms for inventory purchases payment terms generally vary from 30 days to 180 days depending on the inventory product we experienced an increase in our financed inventory from approximately 373 to 383 the calculated financed inventory assumes average inventory excludes intransit inventories and includes only unopened stores with significant inventory 

while we experienced a seven basis point decrease in inventory turns approximately 260 times per year we improved our perstore inventory levels through targeted inventory level improvement initiatives these initiatives included better exit strategies on onetime special buys a focused approach on new store inventory levels and less productive inventory and a more rigorous training program on our e3 inventory management software 

  26 

the decrease in the deferred tax assets is a result of changes in temporary differences associated with the accounting for income taxes certain items of income and expense such as gift card receipts inventory costing and depreciation expense may not be recognized in the same accounting period for income tax purposes as they are for financial reporting purposes 

borrowings and credit facilities 

in august 2002 we entered into a credit agreement with bank of america na as agent for a lender group the “credit agreement” whereby we were permitted to borrow up to 155 million the credit agreement was subsequently amended on january 28 2004 and september 30 2004 primarily with respect to financial covenants and replaced on february 22 2007 

on february 22 2007 we entered into a new senior credit facility with bank of america na as agent for a lender group the “credit agreement” allowing us to borrow up to 250 million with sublimits of 75 million and 10 million for letters of credit and swingline loans respectively this agreement is unsecured and has a five year term with proceeds expected to be used for working capital capital expenditures and share repurchases 

at december 29 2007 there were 55 million in borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement and there were no outstanding borrowings at december 30 2006 there were an additional 250 million and 249 million outstanding letters of credit as of december 29 2007 and december 30 2006 respectively borrowings bear interest at either the bank’s base rate 725 at december 29 2007 or the london interbank offer rate “libor” 486 at december 29 2007 plus an additional amount ranging from 035 to 090 per annum adjusted quarterly based on our performance 050 at december 29 2007 we are also required to pay quarterly in arrears a commitment fee ranging from 006 to 018 per annum and adjusted quarterly based on our performance for unused capacity 010 at december 29 2007 there are no compensating balance requirements associated with the credit agreement 

the credit agreement contains certain restrictions regarding additional indebtedness capital expenditures business operations guarantees investments mergers consolidations and sales of assets transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates and liens the new agreement eliminated the capital expenditures net worth and current ratio requirements from the previous agreement and requires quarterly compliance with respect to fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios we were in compliance with all covenants at december 29 2007 

in february 2008 we exercised the increase option on our senior credit facility increasing the overall capacity from 250 million to 350 million each of the nine lenders within our credit facility bank group participated in the increase simultaneously definitions within the existing credit facility were modified as follows 1 added an additional increase option for 150 million 2 modified the definition of swingline committed amount from 10 million to 20 million and 3 revised the definition of the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant to remove certain defined fixed charges all pricing terms and the term of the facility remained the same 

sources and uses of cash 

our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures and financing activities are payments on debt and repurchase of the company’s common stock the following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years in millions 

 

  27 

operating activities 

the 675 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities in millions 

 

we reclassified cash balances in our bank concentration account against the book overdraft included in accounts payable resulting in a change in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 net cash provided by operations 

the improvement in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 was primarily due to changes in inventory levels and the timing of payments inventory levels increased less in 2007 compared to 2006 due to the timing of imports and a focus on inventory management in 2007 additionally we achieved a slight increase in financed inventory resulting in a higher increase in accounts payable relative to inventory the change in cash used for income taxes relates to the timing of quarterly payments caused by annualized proration requirements 

the 170 million decrease in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities in millions 

 

the decrease in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 is primarily due to the net increase in inventory and accounts payable as discussed in the working capital section partially offset by an increase in net income adjusted for noncash items 

investing activities 

investing activities used 826 million 808 million and 907 million in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the majority of this cash requirement relates to our capital expenditures and in fiscal 2005 the acquisition of the assets of del’s 

our significant store expansion coupled with required investment in infrastructure required the following capital expenditures including capital leases in thousands 

 

  28 

our longterm growth strategy anticipates continued geographic market expansion and further concentration within existing markets this growth will also require continuing investment in information technology and people the costs reflected above are typically building improvements as we lease the majority of our facilities we currently estimate that capital expenditures will range between 100 million and 105 million in fiscal 2008 

financing activities 

financing activities used 851 million provided 101 million and used 162 million in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2007 is mainly the result of share repurchase activity partially offset by borrowings and share issuances 

in february 2007 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program which provides for repurchase of up to 200 million excluding commissions of our outstanding common stock over an approximate threeyear period the repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions the timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors including price corporate and regulatory requirements capital availability and other market conditions the program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice 

for fiscal 2007 we repurchased approximately 32 million shares at a total cost of 1500 million repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance 

we believe that our cash flow from operations borrowings available under the credit agreement and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs including store openings relocations and renovations over the next several years 

significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of december 29 2007 in thousands 

 

 

 the company had outstanding standby letters of credit of 250 million as of december 29 2007 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements consist of operating leases and outstanding letters of credit the balances for these arrangements are discussed above we typically lease buildings for retail stores and offices rather than acquiring these assets which allows us to utilize financial capital to operate the business rather than invest in fixed assets letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory primarily sourced overseas and support certain risk management programs in a timely manner 

  29 

known trends events demands commitments and uncertainties 

litigation 

we are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business after consultation with legal counsel we expect these matters will be resolved without material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations any estimated loss related to such matters has been adequately provided in accrued liabilities to the extent probable and reasonably estimable it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in circumstances relating to these proceedings 

recent accounting pronouncements 

how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement 

in march 2006 the emerging issues task force “eitf” reached a consensus on eitf issue no 063 “how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is gross versus net presentation” which allows companies to adopt a policy of presenting taxes in the income statement on either a gross or net basis taxes within the scope of this eitf would include taxes that are imposed on a revenue transaction between a seller and a customer for example sales taxes use taxes valueadded taxes and some types of excise taxes eitf 063 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning in fiscal 2007 the adoption of eitf 063 did not impact the method for recording and reporting these sales taxes in our consolidated financial statements as our policy is to exclude all such taxes from revenue 

accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 

in june 2006 the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes this interpretation prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements tax positions that meet a “morelikelythannot” recognition threshold should be measured in order to determine the tax benefit to be recognized we adopted fin 48 in fiscal 2007 as required see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

fair value measurements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas 157” sfas 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and expands disclosures about fair value measurements on december 14 2007 the fasb issued proposed fasb staff position no fas 157b “effective date of fasb statement no 157” the proposed fsp the proposed fsp would amend fasb statement no 157 “fair value measurements” statement 157 to delay the effective date of statement 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis that is at least annually the proposed fsp defers the effective date of statement 157 to fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of the proposed fsp the company is subject to the remaining provisions of sfas 157 beginning december 30 2007 the adoption of sfas 157 did not have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 

in february 2007 the fasb issued statement no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” “sfas 159” sfas 159 allows entities the option to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value as of specified dates such election which may be applied on an instrument by instrument basis is typically irrevocable once elected sfas 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 the adoption of sfas 159 did not result in a material impact to our financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

  30 




 i tem 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from the credit agreement the credit agreement bears interest at either the bank’s base rate 725 and 825 at december 29 2007 and december 30 2006 respectively or libor 486 and 532 at december 29 2007 and december 30 2006 respectively plus an additional amount ranging from 035 to 090 per annum adjusted quarterly based on our performance 050 at both december 29 2007 and december 30 2006 we are also required to pay quarterly in arrears a commitment fee ranging from 006 to 018 based on the daily average unused portion of the credit line 010 at december 29 2007 a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would result in approximately 900000 of additional annual interest expense and would not impact the fair market value of the longterm debt

fiscal quarters of each year due to the sale of seasonal products unseasonable weather excessive rain drought and early or late frosts may also affect our sales we believe however that the impact of

purchases of seasonal products in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during the third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the winter selling season business strategy we believe our

7 6 7    100 100 100    purchasing and distribution we offer a differentiated assortment of products for those seeking to enjoy the out here lifestyle our business is not dependent upon any one vendor or particular group of vendors we purchase our products from a core group of approximately 1000 vendors with no one vendor representing more than 10 of our purchases during fiscal 2006 approximately 170 vendors accounted for approximately 80 of our purchases during fiscal 2006 we have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative sources of supply for our products and we believe that adequate sources of supply exist at substantially similar costs for substantially all of our products we have no material longterm contractual commitments with any of our vendors we maintain a dedicated supply chain management team to focus exclusively on all replenishment and forecasting functions this centralized direction permits our buying teams to focus more strategic attention toward vendor line reviews assortment planning and testing of new products and programs through the combined efforts of these teams we expect to improve overall inventory productivity and instock position over 97 of our purchase orders are transmitted through an electronic data interchange edi system and approximately 88 of merchandise vendor invoices are transmitted through edi we are expanding the percentage of vendors who electronically transmit invoices and increasing the amount of sales history transmitted we own and operate a 775000 square foot distribution center in pendleton indiana a 362000 square foot distribution center in waco texas a 482000 square foot distribution center in hagerstown maryland and a 425000 square foot facility in waverly nebraska and lease a 410000 square foot distribution center in braselton georgia and a 71000 square foot dels facility in lakewood washington we believe our overall distribution capacity will support our growth up to an estimated 950 stores in fiscal 2006 we received approximately 82 of our merchandise through these distribution facilities with the balance delivered directly to our stores by our vendors we manage our inbound and outbound transportation activity inhouse through the use of a webbased transportation management system we outsource the management of our dedicated fleets to two thirdparty logistics providers and utilize several common carriers as required the thirdparty logistics providers are responsible for providing drivers and tractors dedicated to transporting merchandise for us we endeavor to control our transportation costs through the monitoring of transportation routes scheduling of deliveries backhauls and optimal utilization of the dedicated fleet of trucks and trailers 3 marketing we utilize an everyday low prices strategy to consistently offer our products at competitive prices complimented by promotions to enhance peak selling seasons we regularly monitor prices at competing stores and adjust our prices as we deem appropriate we believe that by avoiding a saleoriented marketing strategy we are attracting customers on a regular basis rather than only in response to promotional sales to generate store traffic and position ourselves as a destination store we promote broad selections of merchandise primarily advertised at our regular everyday low price with printed color circulars we also run periodic special events promoted through circulars and direct mail advertising we enhance our print marketing programs through the expanded use of national cable and local network television due to the geographic dispersion of our stores the use of national cable advertising is generally more costeffective and additionally serves to promote our stores prior to entering a new market due to the relatively small size of our stores increased traffic in the store ensures increased exposure to most of our products our vendors are committed to helping us promote our brand and position ourselves as a destination store our vendors provide assistance with product presentation and rack design brochures pointofpurchase materials for customers education and product education for our employees we also receive funding through contributions and incentives on purchases to promote new and relocated stores and earn rebates from many vendors on product purchases based on volume competition we operate in a very competitive market the principal competitive factors include location of stores price and quality of merchandise instock consistency merchandise assortment and presentation and customer service we compete with general merchandise home center retailers and other specialty and discount retailers as well as independently owned retail farm and ranch stores numerous privatelyheld regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives some of these competitors are units of national or regional chains and have substantially greater resources and financial capacities than we do however we believe we have successfully differentiated ourselves from these entities by focusing on our specialized market niche management and employees as of december 30 2006 we employed approximately 5500 fulltime and approximately 4300 parttime employees we also employ additional parttime employees during peak periods we are not party to any collective bargaining agreements our district managers store managers and other distribution and support personnel have contributed significantly to our performance we have an internal advisory board comprised of store managers this group brings a grassroots perspective to operational initiatives and generates chainwide endorsement of proposed bestpractice solutions we have implemented numerous best practice teams comprised of employees from all areas of our operations to evaluate our key operations and recommend process changes that will both improve efficiency and strengthen controls our management encourages the participation of all employees in decisionmaking regularly solicits input and suggestions from our employees and responds to the suggestions all of our employees participate in one of various incentive programs which provide the opportunity to receive additional compensation based upon team andor company performance we also provide our employees the opportunity to participate in an employee stock purchase plan and a 401k retirement plan we contribute to the 401k plan solely through a cash match additionally we share in the cost of health insurance provided to our employees and employees receive a discount on merchandise purchased at our stores 4 we encourage a promote from within environment when internal resources permit we also provide internal leadership development programs designed to mentor our high potential employees for continued progress and believe we have satisfactory relationships with our employees all of our executive officers have over 25 years of business experience our district managers and store managers have an average length of service of approximately five years management believes internal promotions coupled with the hiring of individuals with previous retail experience will provide the management structure necessary to support our planned store growth management information and control systems we have invested considerable resources in our management information and control systems to ensure superior customer service manage the purchase and distribution of our merchandise and improve our operating efficiencies our management information and control systems include a pointofsale system a supply chain management and replenishment system a radio frequency picking system in the distribution centers a vendor purchase order control system and a merchandise presentation system these systems are integrated and track merchandise from initial order through ultimate sale all data from these systems are integrated with our financial systems we continue to evaluate and improve the functionality of our systems to maximize their effectiveness such efforts include an ongoing evaluation of the optimal software configuration including system enhancements and upgrades as well as the adequacy of the underlying hardware components these efforts are directed toward constantly improving the overall business processes and achieving the most efficient and effective use of the systems to manage our operations growth strategy our current and longterm growth strategy is to 1 expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores 2 enhance financial performance through samestore sales increases achieved through aggressive merchandising programs with an everyday low prices philosophy and supported by strong customer service 3 enhance product margin through assortment management vendor management sourcing and optimization of transportation and distribution costs 4 leverage operating costs especially occupancy advertising and distribution and 5 expand through selective acquisition as such opportunities arise to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complimentary strategy to organic growth we have experienced considerable sales growth over the last five years with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 228 we plan to continue our growth strategy which anticipates an annual increase in our unit count of approximately 13 this growth has expanded our market presence to 676 retail farm and ranch stores in 37 states and one canadian province we believe this unit count increase along with strategic relocations of small older stores to fullsize formats in areas of greater retail opportunity will contribute substantially to our future growth through store relocations we are able to keep much of our existing loyal customer base but expand our overall reach to new customers thereby growing the business we have relocated 87 stores since 2001 the acquisition of dels enabled us to establish an initial presence in the pacific northwest primarily in washington hawaii and one store in british columbia we believe we have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 750 potential additional markets for new tractor supply stores excluding dels in the united states in addition we continue to identify opportunities to relocate existing stores we expect to open approximately 85 to 90 stores in fiscal 2007 along with approximately 12 store relocations the average estimated cash required to open a new leased store in fiscal 2006 was approximately 800000 to 1400000 the majority of which was for initial acquisition of inventory and capital expenditures principally leasehold improvements fixtures and equipment and approximately 85000 of which was for preopening costs the cash required to complete a store relocation averaged approximately 500000 in fiscal 2006 however relocation costs can vary depending on whether we are responsible for any renovation or remodeling costs additional information we file reports with the securities and exchange

item 1a risk factors  our business faces many risks these risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur our business financial condition or results of operations may suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this form 10k general economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance higher interest rates fuel and other energy costs higher labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the merchandise we offer additionally changes in the mix of products sold to a mix with a lower overall gross margin or other increased cost of sales along with slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory could adversely affect our financial performance high levels of unemployment inflation changes in tax and other laws and other adverse developments in the economy may also adversely affect consumer demand for our merchandise adversely affect gross margins cost of sales inventory turnover and markdowns or otherwise adversely affect our operations and operating results inflationary pressures including rising energy prices may adversely affect our financial performance although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations have been affected by inflation we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items steel grain petroleum corn soybean and other commodities as well as transportation services moreover in the last few years energy prices have risen dramatically which has resulted in increased fuel costs for our business and utility costs for our stores we have been successful in reducing or mitigating the effects of inflation principally through selective buying from the most competitive vendors and by increasing retail prices however there is no assurance that we will be successful in reducing or mitigating the effect of inflation in the future there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to increase sales at our existing stores we experience fluctuations in our samestore sales which are defined as stores which have completed twelve months of sales excluding relocated stores our success depends in part upon our ability to improve sales at our existing stores various factors affect samestore sales including the general retail sales environment our ability to efficiently source and distribute products changes in our merchandise mix competition current economic conditions the timing of release of new merchandise and promotional events the success of marketing programs and weather conditions these factors may cause our samestore sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations past samestore sales are not necessarily an indication of future results and there can be no assurance that our samestore sales will not decrease in the future any failure to meet the samestore sales expectations of investors and security analysts in one or more future periods could adversely affect our results of operations and result in a reduction in the market price of our common stock our failure to effectively manage growth could impair our business even if we are able to implement to a significant degree our key business strategy of expanding our store base we may experience managerial or operational problems which may prevent any significant increase in profitability or 6 negatively impact our cash flow to manage our planned expansion we must ensure the continuing adequacy of our existing systems controls and procedures including product distribution facilities store management financial controls and information systems there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our planned expansion that the new stores will be effectively integrated into our existing operations or that such stores will be profitable failure to open new stores in the manner currently contemplated could adversely affect our financial performance an integral part of our key business strategy includes the expansion of our base of stores by opening new stores if we are unable to implement this strategy our ability to increase our sales profitability and cash flow could be impaired significantly to the extent that we are unable to open new stores in the manner we anticipate due to unforeseen delays in construction or site approval our sales growth would be impaired any failure to meet the growth expectations of investors and security analysts in one or more future periods could reduce the market price of our stock competition in our industry may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations we operate in a very competitive market the principal competitive factors include location of stores price and quality of merchandise instock consistency merchandise assortment and presentation and customer service we believe we have successfully differentiated ourselves from general merchandise home center retailers and other specialty and discount retailers by focusing on our specialized market niche however we do face competition from these entities as well as competition from independentlyowned retail farm and ranch stores several privatelyheld regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives some of our competitors are units of national or regional chains that have substantially greater financial and other resources weather conditions may have a significant impact on our financial results historically weather conditions have had a significant impact on our operating results weather conditions affect the demand for and in some cases the supply of products which in turn has an impact on prices in recent years we have experienced unusually severe weather conditions including ice storms floods and wind damage hurricanes and a summer dearth of water and pasture in some states weather conditions also directly affect the demand for petroleum products particularly during the winter heating season accordingly the weather can have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations there are certain risks associated with the seasonal nature of our business our working capital needs and borrowings generally peak in our first fiscal quarter because lower sales are generated while expenses are incurred in preparation for the spring selling season if cash on hand and borrowings under existing credit facilities are ever insufficient to meet the seasonal needs or if cash flow generated during the spring and summer is insufficient to repay associated borrowings on a timely basis this seasonality could have a material adverse effect on our business we face risks associated with vendors from whom our products are sourced the products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors foreign sourcing of many of the products sold is an important factor in our financial performance all of our vendors must comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting required vendor standards of conduct our ability to find qualified vendors that meet our standards and access products in a timely and efficient manner are significant challenges especially with respect to goods sourced outside the united states these and other issues affecting our vendors including merchandise quality and financial instability of suppliers could adversely affect our financial performance we face risks relating to our reliance on foreign suppliers we rely on foreign manufacturers for various products that we sell in addition many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources we rely on longterm relationships with our suppliers but have no longterm contracts with such suppliers our future success will depend in large measure upon our ability to maintain our existing supplier relationships or to develop new ones this reliance increases the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various products due to local political economic social or environmental conditions transportation delays restrictive actions by foreign governments or changes in united states laws and regulations affecting imports or domestic distribution as an importer our business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business abroad such as foreign governmental regulations economic disruptions delays in shipments transportation capacity and costs currency exchange rates and changes in political or economic conditions in countries from which we purchase products if any such factors were to render the conduct of business in particular countries 7 undesirable or impractical or if additional united states quotas duties taxes or other charges or restrictions were imposed upon the importation of our products in the future our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected our failure to attract and retain qualified employees could adversely affect our financial performance our ability to continue expanding operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees our ability to meet labor needs generally while controlling wage and related labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force unemployment levels prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation if we are unable to locate attract or retain qualified personnel or if costs of labor or related costs increase significantly our financial performance could be adversely affected we may be subject to product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business we maintain general liability insurance with a 250000 deductible for each occurrence and a 6000000 aggregate retention we also maintain umbrella limits above the primary general and products liability cover in many cases we have indemnification rights against the manufacturers of the products and their products liability insurance our ability to recover under such insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject to the financial viability of the insurers and manufacturers and the specific allegations of a claim we cannot assure that our insurance coverage or the manufacturers indemnity will be available or sufficient in any claims brought against us if we experience difficulties with our management information systems our financial performance may be adversely affected we depend on management information systems for many aspects of our business we could be materially adversely affected if our management information systems are disrupted or if we are unable to improve upgrade maintain and expand systems particularly in light of the contemplated continued significant increases in the number of our stores there is no assurance that our product innovations and marketing successes will continue we believe our past performance has been based on and future success will depend upon in part the ability to continue to improve existing product offerings through product innovation and to market new products there is no assurance that we will be successful in the introduction and marketing of any new products or product innovations or that innovations to existing product offerings will be introduced in a timely manner to satisfy our customers needs or expectations failure to introduce new products successfully and in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow the business and could have a material adverse effect on results of our operations and financial condition additionally our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demand and preferences for products and supplies used in recreational farming and ranching if we misjudge the market we may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to take significant inventory markdowns shortages of key items could also have a materially adverse impact on operating results

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   overview tractor supply company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the united states and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and of those who enjoy the rural lifestyle as well as tradesmen and small businesses our stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities and offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise o equine pet and animal products including items necessary for their health care growth and containment o maintenance products for agricultural and rural use o hardware and tool products o seasonal products including lawn and garden power equipment o truck trailer and towing products and o workrecreational clothing and footwear for the entire family our stores currently range in size from approximately 7000 to 28000 square feet of inside selling space and also utilize outside selling space we are developing stores using one of five standard prototypes as well as existing building structures our stores typically range in size from 15500 square feet to 18500 square feet of inside selling space and additional outside selling space our whollyowned subsidiary dels farm supply llc dels operates 18 stores primarily in the pacific northwest that offer a wide selection of products primarily in the equine pet and animal category tailored to those who enjoy the rural lifestyle dels stores currently range in size from approximately 1500 to 7000 square feet of inside selling space with additional outside selling space our current and longterm growth strategy is to 1 expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores 2 enhance financial performance through samestore sales increases achieved through aggressive merchandising and marketing programs with an everyday low prices philosophy and supported by strong customer service 3 enhance product margin through selective assortment vendor price negotiation sourcing and optimization of transportation costs 4 leverage operating costs especially occupancy advertising and distribution and 5 expand through selective acquisition as such opportunities arise to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complimentary strategy to organic growth we have experienced considerable sales growth over the last five years with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 228 we plan to continue this growth strategy with an annual projected increase in our unit count of approximately 13 this growth has expanded our market presence into 37 states and one canadian province we believe the projected unit count increase along with strategic relocations of stores into areas of greater retail opportunity will contribute substantially to our future growth the acquisition of dels enabled us to establish an initial presence in the pacific northwest primarily in washington with one store in british columbia canada we operated 676 retail farm and ranch stores as of december 30 2006 and have plans to open 85 to 90 stores in fiscal 2007 and approximately 12 store relocations we have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 750 potential additional markets for new tractor supply stores excluding dels in the united states in addition we continue to identify opportunities to relocate existing stores we plan to relocate additional stores over the next several years our store relocations are typically undertaken to move small older stores to fullsize formats in improved retail areas we have relocated 87 stores since 2001 we have placed significant emphasis on our merchandising programs evaluating the sales and profitability of our products through detailed line reviews review of vendor performance measures and modification of the overall product offerings these efforts coupled with a strong marketing program and indepth product knowledge training of our store employees have enhanced our sales and financial performance seasonality and weather our business is highly seasonal historically our sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of each year due to the sale of seasonal products unseasonable weather excessive rain drought and early or late frosts may also affect our sales we believe however that the impact of adverse weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of our stores 14 we experience our highest inventory and accounts payable levels during our first fiscal quarter each year for purchases of seasonal product in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the winter selling season inflation although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by inflation we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items steel grain petroleum corn soybean and other commodities as well as transportation services moreover in the last few years energy prices have risen dramatically which has resulted in increased fuel costs for our business and utility costs for our stores we have been successful in reducing or mitigating the effects of inflation principally through selective buying from the most competitive vendors and by increasing retail prices however there is no assurance that we will be successful in reducing or mitigating the effect of inflation in the future significant accounting policies and estimates managements discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our financial position andor results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates revenue recognition and sales returns we recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services if we receive payment before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise as per our layaway program the revenue is deferred until the sale is complete revenues from the sale of gift cards are deferred and recognized upon redemption we estimate a liability for sales returns based on a oneyear rolling average of historical return trends and we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns associated with past sales our estimation techniques have been consistently applied from year to year however as with any estimates refunds activity may vary from estimated amounts inventory valuation impairment risk we identify potentially excess and slowmoving inventory by evaluating turn rates sales trends age of merchandise overall inventory levels and other benchmarks the estimated inventory valuation reserve to recognize any impairment in value ie an inability to realize the full carrying value is based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies we do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term however changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves shrinkage our stores perform physical inventories once a year and we have established reserves for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts this is done by assessing the chainwide average shrinkage experience rate applied to the related periods sales volumes such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences 15 vendor support we receive funding from our vendors for the promotion of our brand as well as the sale of their products vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold which is in compliance with emerging issues task force no 0216 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf 0216 the amount of expected funding is estimated based upon initial guaranteed commitments as well as anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors the estimated purchase volume and related vendor funding is based on our current knowledge of inventory levels sales trends and expected customer demand as well as planned new store openings and relocations although we believe we have the ability to reasonably estimate purchase volume and related vendor funding it is possible that actual results could significantly differ from the estimated amounts freight we incur various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories on an aggregate basis and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold sharebased payments we have sharebased compensation plans covering certain members of management and nonemployee directors prior to january 1 2006 we accounted for stockbased compensation utilizing the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 25 apb 25 accounting for stock issued to employees accordingly no compensation expense was recognized for fixed option plans because the exercise prices of employee stock options equaled or exceeded the market prices of the underlying stock on the dates of grant effective january 1 2006 we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123r sharebased payments using the modified prospective transition method among other items sfas 123r eliminates the use of apb 25 and the intrinsic value method of accounting and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards in the financial statements as we adopted sfas 123r under the modifiedprospectivetransition method results from prior periods have not been restated however prior to adoption of sfas 123r sharebased compensation had been included in pro forma disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to fiscal 2006 we estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant utilizing a modified blackscholes option pricing model the blackscholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of shortterm traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable however key assumptions used in the blackscholes model are adjusted to incorporate the unique characteristics of our stock option awards option valuation models require the input of somewhat subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and expected life we rely on historical volatility trends to estimate future volatility assumptions other assumptions required for estimating fair value with the blackscholes model are the expected riskfree interest rate and expected life of the option the riskfree interest rates used were actual us treasury zerocoupon rates for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant the expected life of the option on the date of grant was estimated based on our historical experience for similar options in addition to the key assumptions used in the blackscholes model the estimated forfeiture rate at the time of valuation which is based on historical experience for similar options is a critical assumption as it reduces expense ratably over the vesting period we adjust this estimate annually based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from the previous estimate we believe our estimates are reasonable in the context of actual historical experience the impact of adopting sfas 123r on future results will depend on among other matters levels of sharebased payments granted in the future actual forfeiture rates and the timing of option exercises 16 sales tax reserve a portion of our sales are to taxexempt customers we obtain exemption information as a necessary part of each taxexempt transaction many of the states in which we conduct business will perform audits to verify our compliance with applicable sales tax laws the business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex environment of compliance these circumstances also create some risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance while we believe we reasonably enforce sales tax compliance with our customers and endeavor to fully comply with all applicable sales tax regulations there can be no assurance that we upon final completion of such audits would not have a significant liability for disallowed exemptions we review our past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to determine if we have potential exposure for noncompliance any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk and our todate experience with each audit as each audit progresses we quantify the exposure based on preliminary assessments made by the state auditors adjusted for additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment the reserve for these tax audits can fluctuate depending on numerous factors including the complexity of agriculturalbased exemptions ambiguity in state tax regulations the number of ongoing audits and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities insurance reserves we selfinsure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance workers compensation and general liability insurance plans we have stoploss insurance policies to protect from individual losses over specified dollar values 200000 for employee health insurance claims 350000 for workers compensation and 250000 for general liability the full extent of certain claims especially workers compensation and general liability claims may not become fully determined for several years therefore we estimate potential obligations for liabilities that have been incurred but not yet reported based upon historical data experience and use of outside actuarial consultants although we believe the reserves established for these obligations are reasonably estimated any significant increase in the number of claims or costs associated with claims made under these plans could have a material adverse effect on our financial

fiscal 2005 included an additional week of sales which impacted the current year sales increase by 15 this increase resulted from the opening of new stores as well as a samestore sales improvement of 16 our average transaction value increased 26 to 4312 and samestore transaction value increased 08 for fiscal 2006 average daily transaction count per store decreased 29 to 238 while samestore transaction count increased 07 samestore sales improvements of 16 compared to 57 in the prior year were strongest in the clothingfootwear and equinepetanimal categories but were partially offset by lower than expected performance in seasonal power equipment generators and cold weatherrelated products including insulated outerwear snow removal and heating in fiscal 2006 we opened 82 new stores compared to 65 new stores and the acquisition of 16 dels stores in fiscal 2005 relocated 15 stores compared to 18 in fiscal 2005 and closed one store compared to one closure in fiscal 2005 as a percent of sales gross margin increased 80 basis points to 317 for fiscal 2006 from 309 for fiscal 2005 gross margin was primarily impacted by a more favorable product mix increased importing and improved inventory shrinkage during the year we refined our method of estimating the freight cost component of inventory based on changes in our business and operating environment which included a change in mix of goods an increased level of importing and rapidly increasing fuel costs this refinement provides a more appropriate matching of freight cost incurred with inventory and cost of merchandise sold this change in estimate increased the inventory value and reduced the freight component of cost of merchandise sold by approximately 29 million for fiscal 2006 as a percent of sales selling general and administrative sga expenses increased 100 basis points to 237 in fiscal 2006 from 227 in fiscal 2005 the increase is primarily attributable to increased occupancy costs and a charge of 97 million or 04 of sales related to stock compensation expense during the year we refined our method of estimating the amount of gift cards sold that will ultimately go unredeemed our estimate was based on an analysis of gift card sale and redemption patterns across an extended historical timeline we accordingly recognized a benefit of 24 million and 03 million in fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively of the 24 million recognized in fiscal 2006 21 million or 01 of sales was due to a modification of the redemption assumptions based on an analysis of historical redemption patterns this benefit has been included as a reduction in selling general and administrative expenses and is reflected as a reduction of other accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 18 effective january 1 2006 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 123r sharebased payment sfas 123r using the modified prospective method and began recognizing compensation expense for sharebased payments based on the fair value of the awards sharebased payments include stock option grants and certain transactions under our other stock plans sfas 123r requires sharebased compensation expense recognized since the beginning of fiscal 2006 to be based on the following a grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas 123 for unvested options granted prior to the adoption date b grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas 123r for all sharebased payments granted subsequent to the adoption date and c the discount on shares sold to employees postadoption which represents the difference between the grant date fair value and the employee purchase price for fiscal 2006 the adoption of the sfas 123r fair value method resulted in additional compensation expense a component of selling general and administrative expenses related to our stock plans that we would not have recognized had we continued to account for sharebased compensation under apb 25 for fiscal 2006 this sharebased compensation expense lowered pretax income by 97 million and net income by 61 million depreciation and amortization expense increased 243 in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 due mainly to costs associated with new and relocated stores and remodeled existing stores net interest expense increased 647 in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005 this increase is primarily due to higher average interest rates in fiscal 2006 and interest incurred as the result of federal and sales tax audits partially offset by a reduction in average longterm borrowings under our revolving credit agreement our effective tax rate was 374 for fiscal 2006 compared to 365 in fiscal 2005 resulting primarily from a higher effective income tax rate due to the nondeductibility of certain stock compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas123r as a result of the foregoing factors net income for fiscal 2006 increased 62 to 910 million or 222 per diluted share which includes a 97 million charge or 015 per diluted share in stock compensation expense this compares to net income of 857 million or 209 per diluted share in fiscal 2005 fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 net sales increased 189 to 20680 million in fiscal 2005 from 17388 million in fiscal 2004 this increase resulted from the opening of new stores including 16 additional stores from the acquisition of dels as well as a samestore sales improvement of 57 fiscal 2005 included an additional week compared to fiscal 2004 which accounted for approximately 18 of the sales increase our average transaction value increased 55 to 4203 and samestore average transaction value increased 43 for fiscal 2005 average daily transactions per store decreased 12 to 245 while samestore transaction count increased 14 the samestore sales increase includes an approximate 12 gain for fiscal 2005 which is attributed to increases in selling prices resulting from rising steel and petroleumrelated product costs samestore transaction count increases were generally experienced across all product lines with seasonal products representing the strongest category in fiscal 2005 we opened 65 new stores compared to 53 in fiscal 2004 acquired an additional 16 dels stores relocated 18 stores compared to 20 in fiscal 2004 and closed one store compared to one in fiscal 2004 as a percent of sales gross margin increased 76 basis points to 309 for fiscal 2005 from 302 for fiscal 2004 gross margin was primarily impacted by overall lower product costs partially offset by higher than anticipated transportation costs caused primarily by increased diesel fuel costs and overall capacity demands on the transportation industry as a percent of sales selling general and administrative sga expenses were comparable at 227 and 228 for fiscal 2005 and 2004 respectively depreciation and amortization expense increased 251 in fiscal 2005 over fiscal year 2004 due mainly to costs associated with new and relocated stores remodeled existing stores and new distribution facilities 19 net interest expense increased 133 in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004 this increase is primarily due to higher average interest rates in fiscal 2005 partially offset by a reduction in average longterm borrowings under the companys revolving credit agreement our effective tax rate was 365 for fiscal 2005 compared to 360 in fiscal 2004 resulting primarily from a higher effective state income tax rate due to the mix of business by state as a result of the foregoing factors net income for fiscal 2005 increased 337 to 857 million or 209 per diluted share compared to net income of 641 million or 157 per diluted share in fiscal 2004 liquidity and capital resources in addition to normal operating expenses our primary ongoing cash requirements are for expansion remodeling and relocation programs including inventory purchases and capital expenditures our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are funds provided from operations commitments available under our revolving credit agreement capital and operating leases and normal trade credit our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the spring and winter selling seasons respectively working capital at december 30 2006 we had working capital of 3161 million a 754 million increase from december 31 2005 this increase was primarily attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities in millions 2006 2005 variance    current assets cash and cash equivalents   376  212  164 inventories  5934 4608 1326 prepaid expenses and other current assets 370 384 14 other net  113 110 03    6793 5314 1479    current liabilities accounts payable   2389  1854  535 accrued expenses  1117 1028 89 income taxes payable  115 14 101 other net  11 11 00    3632 2907 725    working capital   3161  2407  754    the increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to increased cash generated from results of operations in fiscal 2006 the increase in inventories and related increase in accounts payable resulted primarily from the purchase of inventory for new stores new merchandising initiatives and the addition of inventory due to a new larger distribution center in waverly nebraska we also experienced increased inventory levels in many stores as the result of softer than anticipated sales for the fourth quarter and planned improvements in our overall instock position at the store level we experienced a 15 basis point decrease in inventory turns approximately 267 times per year which contributed to a decrease in our financed inventory from approximately 390 to 371 the calculated financed inventory assumes average inventory excludes intransit inventories and includes unopened stores trade credit arises from our vendors granting extended payment terms for inventory purchases payment terms generally vary from 30 days to 180 days depending on the inventory product the increase in accrued expenses was primarily due to increases in the scale of our business volume the timing of the accruals and the related payment of those accruals the increase in income taxes payable resulted from increased income and the timing of estimated tax payments 20 borrowings and credit facilities in august 2002 we entered into a credit agreement with bank of america na as agent for a lender group the credit agreement allowing us to borrow up to 155 million the credit agreement was subsequently amended on january 28 2004 and september 30 2004 and replaced on february 22 2007 see below both amendments included changes to certain financial covenants primarily to provide flexibility for capital expenditures and extended the maturity to february 27 2008 there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement at december 30 2006 and 82 million was outstanding at december 31 2005 the balance of funds available under the credit agreement may be utilized for borrowings and up to 50 million for letters of credit of which 249 million and 121 million were outstanding at december 30 2006 and december 31 2005 respectively these letters of credit were issued primarily for the purchase of inventory the credit agreement bears interest at either the banks base rate 825 at december 30 2006 or the london interbank offer rate libor 532 at december 30 2006 plus an additional amount ranging from 075 to 15 per annum adjusted quarterly based on our performance 075 at december 30 2006 we are also required to pay quarterly in arrears a commitment fee ranging from 020 to 035 per annum 020 at december 30 2006 and adjusted quarterly based on our performance on the average daily unused portion of the credit line there are no compensating balance requirements associated with the credit agreement the credit agreement contains certain restrictions regarding additional indebtedness capital expenditures business operations guarantees investments mergers consolidations and sales of assets transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates and liens in addition we must comply with certain quarterly restrictions based on a rolling fourquarters basis regarding net worth leverage ratio fixed charge coverage current ratio requirements and spending limits on capital expenditures we were in compliance with all covenants at december 30 2006 in february 2007 we entered into a new senior credit facility with largely the same lender group as under the credit agreement the new senior credit facility provides for borrowings up to 250 million with sublimits of 75 million and 10 million for letters of credit and swingline loans respectively this agreement is unsecured and has a fiveyear term with proceeds expected to be used for working capital capital expenditures and share repurchases borrowings will bear interest at either the banks base rate or libor plus an additional amount ranging from 035 to 090 per annum adjusted quarterly based on our performance 050 at february 2007 we will also be required to pay a commitment fee ranging from 006 to 018 per annum for unused capacity this new agreement eliminates the capital expenditures net worth and current ratio requirements from the previous credit agreement and requires quarterly compliance with respect to fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios sources and uses of cash our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations principal uses of cash for investing and financing activities are capital expenditures and payments on debt respectively the following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years in millions 2006 2005 2004    net cash provided by operating activities   871  992  771 net cash used in investing activities  808 907 873 net cash provided by used in financing activities  101 162 192    net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents  164  77  90    21 operating activities the 121 million decrease in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities in millions 2006 2005 variance    net income   910  857  53 tax benefit of stock options exercised  125 125 depreciation and amortization  423 340 83 stock compensation expense  97  97 deferred income taxes  35 127 92 inventories and accounts payable  791 349 442 accrued expenses  88 128 40 income taxes currently payable  101 14 87 other net  78 04 74    net cash provided by operations   871  992  121    the decrease in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 is primarily due to the net increase in inventory and accounts payable as discussed in the working capital section partially offset by an increase in net income adjusted for noncash items the 221 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004 was primarily due to changes in the following operating activities in millions 2006 2005 variance    net income   857  641  216 depreciation and amortization  340 272 68 deferred income taxes  127 46 81 inventories and accounts payable  349 442 93 prepaid expenses and other current assets 71 22 49 accrued expenses  128 202 74 other net  214 166 48    net cash provided by operations   992  771  221    the increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 was primarily due to the increase in net income exclusive of depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes and a net decrease in inventory and accounts payable increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a relative decrease in accrued expenses was primarily due to the growth in cash provided by operations these increases were primarily due to the growth in our business during fiscal 2005 and the timing of payments investing activities investing activities used 808 million 907 million and 873 million in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the majority of this cash requirement relates to our capital expenditures and in fiscal 2005 the acquisition of the assets of dels our significant store expansion coupled with required investment in infrastructure required the following capital expenditures including capital leases in thousands 2006 2005 2004    new and relocated stores and stores not yet opened 54111 40525 30758 existing stores  30547 13936 10033 distribution center

geographic market expansion and further concentration within existing markets this growth will also require continuing investment in information technology and people the costs reflected below are typically building improvements as we lease the majority of our facilities we currently estimate that capital expenditures will approximate 100 million in fiscal 2007 financing activities financing activities provided 101 million used 162 million and provided 192 million in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively excluding the tax benefit recognized in 2006 as a result of the adoption of sfas 123r financing activities in fiscal 2006 would have been 06 million the cash provided by financing activities is largely net cash provided as a result of borrowings required by operations partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of stock under stock incentive programs we believe that our cash flow from operations borrowings available under the new senior credit facility and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs including store openings relocations and renovations over the next several years significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of december 30 2006 in thousands payment due by period  total contractual less than more

2007 the company had outstanding standby letters of credit of 249 million as of december 30 2006 offbalance sheet arrangements the extent of our offbalance sheet arrangements is operating leases and outstanding letters of credit the balances for these arrangements are discussed above we typically lease buildings for retail stores and offices rather than acquiring these assets which allow us to utilize financial capital to operate the business rather than invest in fixed assets letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory primarily sourced overseas and support certain risk management programs in a timely manner known trends events demands commitments and uncertainties litigation we are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business after consultation with legal counsel we expect these matters will be resolved without material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations any estimated loss related to such matters has been adequately provided in accrued liabilities to the extent probable and reasonably estimable it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in circumstances relating to these proceedings in july 2004 a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the chancery court for davidson county tennessee by the hawaii laborers pension plan against each of our directors certain of our officers and one former 23 director we were named as a nominal defendant on december 3 2004 the court granted our motion to dismiss and ordered that all claims in the amended complaint be dismissed without prejudice although the plaintiff filed subsequent appellate motions all were dismissed all applicable statutes of limitations have run concluding the matter in our favor recent accounting pronouncements sharebased payments in december 2004 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123r sharebased payment sfas 123r sfas 123r is a revision of sfas 123 and supersedes apb 25 among other items sfas 123r eliminates the use of the intrinsic value method of accounting and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under the new standard we adopted sfas 123r in fiscal 2006 as required see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement in march 2006 the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 063 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is gross versus net presentation which allows companies to adopt a policy of presenting taxes in the income statement on either a gross or net basis taxes within the scope of this eitf would include taxes that are imposed on a revenue transaction between a seller and a customer for example sales taxes use taxes valueadded taxes and some types of excise taxes eitf 063 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning in fiscal 2007 eitf 063 will not impact the method for recording and reporting these sales taxes in our consolidated financial statements as our policy is to exclude all such taxes from revenue accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in june 2006 the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 fin 48 to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes this interpretation prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements tax positions that meet a morelikelythannot recognition threshold should be measured in order to determine the tax benefit to be recognized we will adopt fin 48 in fiscal 2007 as required we currently estimate a charge to retained earnings of approximately 2 million to be recognized as the cumulative effect of adoption additionally we anticipate the adoption of this pronouncement will increase our effective income tax rate in fiscal 2007 by approximately 60 basis points 


item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from the credit agreement the credit agreement bears interest at either the banks base rate 825 and 725 december 30 2006 and december 31 2005 respectively or libor 532 and 439 at december 30 2006 and december 31 2005 respectively plus an additional amount ranging from 075 to 150 per annum adjusted quarterly based on our performance 075 at both december 30 2006 and december 31 2005 we are also required to pay quarterly in arrears a commitment fee ranging from 020 to 035 based on the daily average unused portion of the credit line a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would result in approximately 378000 of additional annual interest expense and would not impact the fair market value of the longterm debt 24

profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of each
year due to the sale of seasonal products unseasonable weather excessive rain
drought and early or late frosts may also affect the companys sales the
company believes however that the impact of adverse weather conditions is
somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of its stores

its first fiscal quarter each year for purchases of seasonal product in
anticipation of the spring selling season and again during its third fiscal
quarter in anticipation of the winter selling season

or circumstances described in the following risk factors occurs the companys
business financial condition or results of operations may suffer and the
trading price of the companys common stock could decline these risk factors
should be read in conjunction with the other information in this form 10k

general economic conditions may adversely affect the companys financial
performance
the company has exposure to potentially higher interest rates higher fuel and
other energy costs higher labor and healthcare costs and other economic
factors that adversely affect consumer demand for the merchandise offered by the
company additionally changes in the mix of products sold to a mix with a lower
overall gross margin or other increased cost of sales along with slower
inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory could adversely affect
the companys financial performance high levels of unemployment inflation
changes in tax and other laws and other adverse developments in the economy may
also adversely affect consumer demand for the companys merchandise adversely
affect gross margins cost of sales inventory turnover and markdowns or
otherwise adversely affect the companys operations and operating results

inflationary pressures including rising energy prices may adversely affect the
companys financial performance
although the company cannot accurately determine the full effect of inflation on
its operations it believes its sales and results of operations have been
affected by inflation the company is subject to market risk with respect to the
pricing of certain products and services which include among other items
steel grain petroleum corn soybean and other commodities as well as
transportation services moreover in the last few years energy prices have
risen dramatically which has resulted in increased fuel costs for the companys
business and utility costs for the companys stores the company has been
successful in reducing or mitigating the effects of inflation principally

through selective buying from the most competitive vendors and by increasing
retail prices however there is no assurance that the company will be
successful in reducing or mitigating the effect of inflation on the company in
the future

there is no assurance that the company will be able to continue to increase
sales at its existing stores
the company experiences fluctuations in its samestore sales which are defined
as stores which have completed twelve months of sales the companys success
depends in part upon its ability to improve sales at its existing stores
various factors affect samestore sales including the general retail sales
environment the companys ability to efficiently source and distribute
products changes in the companys merchandise mix competition current
economic conditions the timing of release of new merchandise and promotional
events the success of marketing programs and weather conditions these factors
may cause the companys samestore sales results to differ materially from prior
periods and from expectations past samestore sales are not necessarily an
indication of future results and there can be no assurance that the companys
samestore sales will not decrease in the future any failure to meet the
samestore sales expectations of investors and security analysts in one or more
future periods could reduce the market price of the companys common stock

the companys failure to effectively manage growth could impair its business
even if the company is able to implement to a significant degree its key
business strategy of expanding its store base it may experience managerial or
operational problems which may prevent any significant increase in
profitability or negatively impact its cash flow to manage its planned
expansion the company must ensure the continuing adequacy of its existing
systems controls and procedures including product distribution facilities
store management financial controls and information systems there can be no
assurance that the company will be able to achieve its planned expansion that
the new stores will be effectively integrated into the companys existing
operations or that such stores will be profitable

if the company fails to open new stores in the manner currently contemplated
the companys financial performance could be adversely affected
a key part of the companys key business strategy includes the expansion of its
base of stores by opening new stores if the company is unable to implement this
strategy the companys ability to increase its sales profitability and cash
flow could be impaired significantly to the extent that the company is unable
to open new stores in the manner the company anticipates due to unforeseen
delays in construction or site approval the companys sales growth would be
dependent on increases in samestore sales any failure to meet the growth
expectations of investors and security analysts in one or more future periods
could reduce the market price of the companys stock

competition in the companys industry may hinder the companys ability to
execute its business strategy and adversely affect its operations
the company operates in a highly competitive market the principal competitive
factors include location of stores price and quality of merchandise instock
consistency merchandise assortment and presentation and customer service the
company believes it has successfully differentiated itself from general
merchandise home center retailers and other specialty and discount retailers by
focusing on its specialized market niche ie supplying the lifestyle needs of
recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle as
well as tradesmen and small businesses however the company does face select
competition from these entities as well as competition from independentlyowned
retail farm and ranch stores several privatelyheld regional farm store chains
and farm cooperatives some of these competitors are units of large national or
regional chains that have substantially greater financial and other resources
than the company

weather conditions may have a significant impact on the companys financial
results
historically weather conditions have had a significant impact on the companys
operating results weather conditions affect the demand for and in some cases
the supply of products which in turn has an impact on prices in recent years
the company has experienced unusually severe weather conditions including ice
storms floods and wind damage hurricanes and a summer dearth of water and
pasture in some states weather conditions also directly affect the demand for
petroleum products particularly during the winter heating season accordingly
the weather can have a material effect on the companys financial condition and
results of operations

there are certain risks associated with the seasonal nature of the companys
business
the companys working capital needs and borrowings generally peak in the first
fiscal quarter because lower sales are generated while expenses are incurred in
preparation for the spring selling season if cash on hand and borrowings under
existing credit facilities are ever insufficient to meet the seasonal needs or
if cash flow generated during the


                                       7
page

spring and summer is insufficient to repay associated borrowings on a timely
basis this seasonality could have a material adverse effect on our business

the company faces risks associated with vendors from whom the companys products
are sourced
the products sold by the company are sourced from a variety of domestic and
international vendors foreign sourcing of many of the products sold is an
important factor in the companys financial performance all of the companys
vendors must comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental
laws and otherwise be certified as meeting required vendor standards of
conduct the ability to find qualified vendors that meet company standards and
access products in a timely and efficient manners is a significant challenge
especially with respect to goods sourced outside the united states these and
other issues affecting the companys vendors including merchandise quality and
financial instability of suppliers could adversely affect the companys
financial performance additionally one vendor accounted for approximately 13
of the companys purchases in fiscal 2005 if this vendor were unable to meet
the growing supply needs of the company sales could be adversely affected

the company faces risks relating to its reliance on foreign suppliers
the company relies on foreign manufacturers for various products that are sold
in addition many of the companys domestic suppliers purchase a portion of
their products from foreign sources the company relies on its longterm
relationships with its suppliers but has no longterm contracts with such
suppliers the companys future success will depend in large measure upon its
ability to maintain its existing supplier relationships or to develop new ones
this reliance increases the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various
products due to local political economic social or environmental conditions
transportation delays restrictive actions by foreign governments or changes in
united states laws and regulations affecting imports or domestic distribution
as an importer the companys business is subject to the risks generally
associated with doing business abroad such as foreign governmental regulations
economic disruptions delays in shipments transportation capacity and costs
currency exchange rates and changes in political or economic conditions in
countries from which the company purchases products if any such factors were to
render the conduct of business in particular countries undesirable or
impractical or if additional united states quotas duties taxes or other
charges or restrictions were imposed upon the importation of the companys
products in the future the companys financial condition and results of
operations could be materially adversely affected

the companys failure to attract and retain qualified employees could adversely
affect the companys financial performance
the ability to continue to expand operations depends on the companys ability to
attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees the
ability to meet labor needs generally while controlling wage and related labor
costs is subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a
sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force unemployment levels
prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs
and changes in employment legislation if the company is unable to locate to
attract or to retain qualified personnel or if costs of labor or related costs
increase significantly the companys financial performance could be adversely
affected

the company may be subject to product liability and other claims in the ordinary
course of business
the companys business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in
the ordinary course of business the company maintains general liability
insurance with a 250000 deductible for each occurrence and a 5000000
aggregate retention the company also maintains umbrella limits above the
primary general and products liability cover in many cases the company has
indemnification rights against the manufacturers of the products and their
products liability insurance the companys ability to recover under such
insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject to the financial viability
of the insurers and manufacturers and the specific allegations of a claim the
company cannot assure that its insurance coverage or the manufacturers
indemnity will be available or sufficient in any future cases brought against
the company

if the company experiences difficulties with its management information systems
its financial performance may be adversely affected
the company depends on management information systems for many aspects of its
business the company will be materially adversely affected if its management
information systems are disrupted or it is unable to improve upgrade maintain
and expand systems particularly in light of the contemplated continued
significant increases in the number of the companys stores


                                       8

there is no assurance that the companys product innovations and marketing
successes will continue
the company believes that its past performance has been based on and future
success will depend upon in part the ability to continue to improve existing
product offerings through product innovation and to market new products there
is no assurance that the company will be successful in the introduction and
marketing of any new products or product innovations or that innovations to
existing product offerings will be introduced in a timely manner to satisfy
customer needs or expectations failure to introduce new products successfully
and in a timely manner could harm the companys ability to grow the business and
could have a material adverse effect on results of the companys operations and
financial condition

the companys success depends on its ability to anticipate and respond in a
timely manner to changing customer demand and preferences for products and
supplies used in recreational farming and ranching if the company misjudges the
market the company may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced
to take significant inventory markdowns shortages of key items could also have
a materially adverse impact on operating results

seasonality and weather

the companys business is highly seasonal historically the companys sales and
profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of each
year due to the sale of seasonal products the company typically operates at
approximately break even in the first fiscal quarter of each year unseasonable
weather excessive rain drought and early or late frosts may also affect the
companys sales the company believes however that the impact of adverse
weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of its
stores

the company experiences its highest inventory and accounts payable levels during
its first fiscal quarter each year for purchases of seasonal product in
anticipation of the spring selling season and again during its third fiscal
quarter in anticipation of the winter selling season

inflation

although the company cannot accurately determine the full effect of inflation on
its operations it believes its sales and results of operations have been
affected by inflation the company is subject to market risk with respect to the
pricing of certain products and services which include among other items
steel grain petroleum corn soybean and other commodities as well as
transportation services moreover in the last few years energy prices have
risen dramatically which has resulted in increased fuel costs for the companys
business and utility costs for the companys stores the company has been
successful in reducing or mitigating the effects of inflation principally
through selective buying from the most competitive vendors and by increasing
retail prices however there is no assurance that the company will be
successful in reducing or mitigating the effect of inflation on the company in
the future

results of operations are based upon the companys consolidated financial

fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004

net sales increased 189 to 20680 million in fiscal 2005 from 17388
million in fiscal 2004 this increase resulted from the opening of new stores
including 16 additional stores from the acquisition of dels farm supply as
well as a samestore sales improvement of 57 fiscal 2005 included an
additional week compared to last year which accounted for approximately 18 of
the sales increase the companys total average transaction value increased 55
to 4203 for the twelve months ended fiscal 2005 while average daily
transactions decreased to 245 compared to 248 in the prior year while
samestore sales transactions increased 14 the samestore sales increase
includes an approximate 12 gain for fiscal year 2005 which is attributed to
increases in selling prices resulting from rising steel and petroleumrelated
product costs samestore sales increases were generally experienced across all
product lines with seasonal products representing the strongest category

in fiscal 2005 the company opened 65 new stores compared to 53 in the prior
year acquired an additional 16 stores from the acquisition of dels relocated
18 stores compared to 20 in the prior year and closed one store compared to
one in the prior year

as a percent of sales gross margin increased 76 basis points to 309 for
fiscal 2005 from 302 for fiscal 2004 gross margin was primarily impacted by
overall lower product costs partially offset by higher than anticipated
transportation costs caused primarily by increased diesel fuel costs and
overall capacity demands on the transportation industry

as a percent of sales selling general and administrative sga expenses
were comparable at 227 and 228 for fiscal 2005 and 2004 respectively

depreciation and amortization expense increased 251 in fiscal 2005 over the
prior year due mainly to costs associated with new and relocated stores
remodeled existing stores and new distribution facilities

net interest expense increased 133 in fiscal 2005 from the prior year this
increase is primarily due to higher average interest rates in the current year
partially offset by a reduction in average longterm borrowings under the
companys revolving credit agreement

the companys effective tax rate was 365 for fiscal 2005 compared to 360 in
the prior year resulting primarily from a higher effective state income tax
rate due to the mix of business by state

as a result of the foregoing factors net income for fiscal 2005 increased 337
to 857 million or 209 per diluted share compared to net income of 641
million or 157 per diluted share in the prior year

fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003

net sales increased 181 to 17388 million in fiscal 2004 from 14729
million in fiscal 2003 this increase resulted from the opening of new stores as
well as a samestore sales improvement of 99 the companys favorable
performance versus prior year was driven primarily by the opening of 53 new
stores market share gains in certain markets continued improvement in
merchandising programs and successful implementation of new initiatives in
presentation purchasing and product selection samestore sales increases were
generally experienced across all product lines with equine pet and animal
products representing the strongest category the companys average transaction
value increased 47 to 3983 for the twelve months ended fiscal 2004
increased average transaction counts also contributed to the increase in
samestore sales the samestore sales increase included an approximate 26
gain for fiscal year 2004 which was attributable to increases in selling prices
resulting from rising steel grain and petroleumrelated product costs

in fiscal 2004 the company opened 53 new stores compared to 31 in the prior
year relocated 20 stores compared to 18 in the prior year and closed one
store compared to one in the prior year

as a percent of sales gross margin decreased 30 basis points to 302 for
fiscal 2004 from 305 for fiscal 2003 gross margin was negatively impacted
primarily by higher than anticipated freight costs caused primarily by


                                       18
page

increased diesel fuel costs and demand in the transportation industry and
absorption of some of the impact of higher steel and other commodity costs the
impact of cost increases was partially recovered through higher selling prices

as a percent of sales selling general and administrative sga expenses
were 228 and 225 for fiscal 2004 and 2003 respectively the loss in sga
leverage was due primarily to approximately 32 million in expenses incurred
for the consolidation and relocation of the companys store support center
additionally new store openings fell behind schedule during the middle of the
year negatively impacting expense leverage

depreciation and amortization expense increased 259 in fiscal 2004 over the
prior year due mainly to costs associated with new and relocated stores
remodeled existing stores and new distribution facilities

net interest expense decreased 582 in fiscal 2004 from the prior year this
decrease reflected stronger cash flow and less cash requirements for store
openings which resulted in reduced average longterm borrowings under the
companys revolving credit agreement

the companys effective tax rate was 360 for fiscal 2004 compared to 376 in
the prior year resulting primarily from a lower effective state income tax rate
due to the mix of business by state

as a result of the foregoing factors net income for fiscal 2004 increased 151
to 641 million or 157 per diluted share compared to net income of 557
million or 138 per diluted share in the prior year exclusive of the
cumulative effect of the change in 2003 in the companys method of accounting
for consideration received from vendors net income for fiscal 2003 was 576
million or 143 per diluted share the increase in net income for fiscal 2004
is primarily a result of the factors discussed above and leveraging operating
costs with increased sales

change in accounting principle

emerging issue task force issue no 0216 eitf 0216 accounting by a
customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a
vendor provides guidance for the accounting treatment and income statement
classification for consideration given by a vendor to a retailer in connection
with the sale of the vendors products or for the promotion of sales of the
vendors products the eitf concluded that such consideration received from
vendors should be reflected as a decrease in prices paid for inventory and
recognized in cost of sales as the related inventory is sold prior to adopting
this pronouncement the company classified all vendorprovided marketing support
funds as a reduction in selling general and administrative expenses

the effect of applying eitf 0216 on priorperiod financial statements would
have resulted in a change to previously reported net income thus the company
has reported the adoption of eitf 0216 as a cumulative effect adjustment
accordingly in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 the company recorded a
cumulative effect of accounting change of 31 million 19 million net of
income taxes for the impact of this adoption on prior fiscal years

liquidity and capital resources

in addition to normal operating expenses the companys primary ongoing cash
requirements are for expansion remodeling and relocation programs including
inventory purchases and capital expenditures the companys primary ongoing
sources of liquidity are funds provided from operations commitments available
under its revolving credit agreement capital and operating leases and normal
trade credit the companys inventory and accounts payable levels typically
build in the first and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the spring and
winter selling seasons respectively

the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to payments on
outstanding borrowings

the increase in inventories and related increase in accounts payable resulted
primarily from additional inventory for new stores including preparation of
stores to open in the subsequent year and an increase in average inventory per
store due to an expected increase in sales trade credit arises from the
companys vendors granting extended payment terms for inventory purchases
payment terms vary from 30 days to 180 days depending on the product and vendor

the increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued expenses
was generally due to the increase in the number of stores in operation and
resulting increases in sales growth in operations and timing of payments

america na as agent for a lender group the credit agreement whereby the

operating activities

the 221 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2005
over fiscal 2004 is primarily due to changes in the following operating
activities in millions



                                                                             2005           2004         variance

the increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2005 compared with
fiscal 2004 is primarily due to the improvement in net earnings exclusive of
depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes and a net decrease in
inventory and accounts payable increases in the cash used for prepaid expenses
and other current assets and a relative decrease in accrued expenses was
primarily due to the growth in the companys business during the year and the
timing of payments

the 132 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2004
from fiscal 2003 was primarily due to changes in the following operating
activities in millions

the increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2004 compared with
fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the improvement in net earnings exclusive of
depreciation and amortization offset by a net increase in inventory and
accounts payable increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets and
accrued expenses also contributed to the growth in cash provided by operations
these increases were primarily due to the growth in the companys business
during fiscal 2004 and the timing of payments

investing activities

investing activities used 907 million 873 million and 434 million in
fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the majority of this cash requirement
relates to the companys capital expenditures and in fiscal 2005 to the
acquisition of the assets of dels farm supply in 2005

the companys longterm growth strategy anticipates continued geographic market
expansion and further concentration within existing markets this growth will
also require continuing investment in information technology and people the
costs reflected are typically building improvements as the company leases the
majority of its facilities the company currently estimates that capital
expenditures will be approximately 800 million in fiscal 2006 as follows in
thousands



                                                                             2006

financing activities

financing activities used 162 million provided 192 million and used 143
million in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively largely as a result of
borrowing requirements created by operations partially offset by proceeds
received from the issuance of stock under stock incentive programs

the company believes that its cash flow from operations borrowings available
under the credit agreement and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund
the companys operations and its capital expenditure needs including store
openings relocations and renovations over the next several years

rather than acquiring these significant assets allows the company to utilize
financial capital to operate the business rather than invest in fixed assets
letters of credit allow the company to purchase inventory in a timely manner

known trends events demands commitments and uncertainties

litigation

the company is involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary
course of business after consultation with legal counsel management expects
these matters will be resolved without material adverse effect on the companys
consolidated financial position or results of operations any estimated loss
related to such matters has been adequately provided in accrued liabilities to
the extent probable and reasonably estimable it is possible however that
future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could
be materially affected by changes in circumstances relating to these
proceedings

as previously disclosed in the companys annual report on form 10k for fiscal
2004 filed on march 10 2005 which annual report was amended by the filing of
amendment no 1 to the companys annual report on form 10ka on april 21
2005 in july 2004 a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the
chancery court for davidson county tennessee by the hawaii laborers pension
plan against each of the companys directors certain of its officers and one
former director the company was named as a nominal defendant on september 17
2004 the plaintiff filed an amended complaint on october 8 2004 the company
moved to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to make a presuit demand on
the board of directors on december 3 2004 the court granted the companys
motion to dismiss and ordered that all claims in the amended complaint be
dismissed without prejudice on february 17 2005 the court entered an order
denying a motion by the plaintiff to alter or amend the december 3 2004 order
and judgment dismissing the amended complaint on march 18 2005 the plaintiff
appealed the order to the tennessee court of appeals on october 3 2005
plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the appeal and on october 19 2005 the
tennessee court of appeals dismissed the appeal

sales tax compliance

a portion of the companys sales are with taxexempt customers the company
obtains exemption information as a necessary part of each tax exempt
transaction many of the states in which the company conducts business will
audit the company to verify its compliance with applicable sales tax laws the
business activities of the companys customers and the intended use of the
unique products sold by the company create a challenging and complex environment
of compliance these circumstances also create some risk that the company could
be challenged as to the propriety of its sales tax compliance while the company
believes it reasonably enforces sales tax compliance with its customers and
endeavors to fully comply with all applicable sales tax regulations there can
be no assurance that the company upon final completion of such audits would
not have a significant liability for disallowed exemptions management believes
it has adequately provided for such liability based on known assessments and
expected settlements

recent accounting pronouncements

stock options
in december 2004 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards
sfas no 123r sharebased payment sfas 123r sfas 123r is a revision
of sfas 123 and supersedes apb 25 among other items sfas 123r eliminates the
use of the intrinsic value method of accounting and requires companies to
recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of
equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards pro
forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under the new standard the company
has adopted sfas 123r in fiscal 2006 as required

sfas 123r permits the use of either a modified prospective method or a
modified retrospective method under the modified prospective method
compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the
effective date based on the requirements of sfas 123r for all sharebased
payments granted after that date and based on the requirements of sfas 123 for
all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas 123r under the
modified retrospective method the requirements are the same as under the
modified prospective method but also permit the restatement of prior period
financial statements based on proforma disclosures made in accordance with sfas
123


                                       23
page

the company currently utilizes a standard option pricing model ie
blackscholes to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees
while sfas 123r permits entities to continue to use such a model the standard
also permits the use of a more complex binomial or lattice model based upon
research done by the company on the alternative models available to value option
grants and in conjunction with the type and number of stock options expected to
be issued in the future the company has determined that it will continue to use
a modified blackscholes model for option valuation

sfas 123r includes several modifications to the presentation of income taxes in
the financial statements the expense for certain types of option grants is only
deductible for tax purposes at the time that the taxable event takes place
which could cause variability in the companys effective tax rates recorded
throughout the year sfas 123r does not allow companies to predict when these
taxable events will take place furthermore it requires that the benefits
associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be
reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as
required under current rules this requirement will reduce net operating cash
flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date
the income tax impact is uncertain and cannot be estimated because it will
depend on among other things when employees exercise stock options the amount
of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax
deductions as shown in the companys consolidated statement of cash flows were
125 million 87 million and 43 million respectively for 2005 2004 and
2003

the company will utilize the modified prospective method the company expects
that the adoption of sfas 123r on january 1 2006 will reduce fiscal 2006 net
earnings by approximately 70 million 44 million after tax see note 14 to
the consolidated financial statements for further information on the companys
stockbased compensation plans

inventory costs
in november of 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 inventory costs an
amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4 sfas 151 the purpose of this statement
is to clarify the accounting of abnormal amounts of idle facility expense
freight handling costs and waste material arb no 43 stated that under some
circumstances these costs may be so abnormal that they are required to be
treated as current period costs sfas 151 requires that these costs be treated
as current period costs regardless if they meet the criteria of so abnormal
the provisions of sfas 151 shall be effective for inventory costs incurred
during fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 adoption of sfas 151 on
january 1 2006 did not have a material impact on the companys results of
operations or financial position

exchange of nonmonetary assets
in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 153 exchanges of nonmonetary
assets an amendment of apb opinion no 29 sfas 153 sfas 153 is based on
the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on
the fair value of the assets exchanged sfas 153 was effective for nonmonetary
asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning with the third quarter of
2005 with earlier application permitted adoption of sfas 153 did not have a
material impact on the companys results of operations or financial position



item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

the company complies with sfas nos 133 137 and 138 collectively sfas 133
pertaining to the accounting for derivatives and hedging activities sfas 133
requires the company to recognize all derivative instruments in the balance
sheet at fair value sfas 133 impacted the accounting for the companys interest
rate swap agreement which was designated as a cash flow hedge

the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from its credit
agreement the credit agreement bears interest at either the banks base rate
725 and 525 december 31 2005 and december 25 2004 respectively or libor
439 and 242 at december 31 2005 and december 25 2004 respectively plus
an additional amount ranging from 075 to 150 per annum adjusted quarterly
based on company performance 075 at both december 31 2005 and december 25
2004 the company is also required to pay quarterly in arrears a commitment
fee ranging from 020 to 035 based on the daily average unused portion of the
credit line a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move increase in interest
rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would result in approximately
180000 of additional annual interest expense and would not impact the fair
market value of the longterm debt

        offer its products at competitive prices the company regularly monitors
        prices at competing stores and adjusts its prices as necessary the
        company believes that by avoiding a sale oriented marketing strategy
        it is attracting customers on a regular basis rather than only in
        response to sales

        to generate store traffic and position itself as a destination store
        the company promotes broad selections of merchandise primarily
        advertised at the regular everyday low price with color circulars the
        company also runs periodic special events promoted through circulars and
        direct mail advertising the company enhances its print marketing and
        advertising programs through the expanded use of national cable and
        local network television due to the geographic dispersion of the
        companys stores the use of national cable advertising is generally
        more costeffective and additionally serves to promote the company in
        advance of entering a new market

        the companys vendors realize the value of the company being a
        destination store due to the relatively small size of its stores

        purchases based on volume

        competitive factors include location of stores price and quality of
        merchandise instock consistency merchandise assortment and
        presentation and customer service the company believes it has

        retailers and other specialty and discount retailers by focusing on its
        specialized market niche ie supplying the lifestyle needs of
        recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural
        lifestyle as well as tradesmen and small businesses however the

        cooperatives some of these competitors are units of large national or

restatement of financial statements

on february 7 2005 the office of the chief accountant of the securities and
exchange commission sec issued a letter to the american institute of
certified public accountants expressing its views regarding certain operating
lease accounting issues and their application under generally accepted
accounting principles gaap in light of this letter the companys
management initiated a review of its leaserelated accounting methods and
determined that the companys methods of accounting for 1 amortization of
leasehold improvements 2 leasehold improvements funded by landlord incentives
and 3 rent expense prior to commencement of operations and rent payments
while in line with common industry practice were not in accordance with gaap
as a result the company restated its consolidated financial statements for each
of the fiscal years ended december 27 2003 and december 28 2002 and the first
three quarters of fiscal 2004 included in this report


                                       13
page

previously the company had amortized its leasehold improvements over the shorter
of 1 the estimated life of the asset or 2 the lease term including the
first fiveyear renewal option for initial term leases of 10 years or less
management determined that the appropriate interpretation of the lease term
under statement of financial accounting standards no 13 accounting for
leases sfas 13 is the sum of the fixed noncancellable term and any options
where at the inception of the lease renewal is reasonably assured management
determined that renewal of the majority of lease terms associated with leasehold
improvements whose useful lives included the option period while expected were
not reasonably assured under sfas 13 accordingly the company accelerated the
amortization of those leasehold improvements to coincide with the end of the
fixed noncancellable term of the lease

additionally the company had historically accounted for leasehold improvements
funded by landlord incentives as reductions in the cost of the related leasehold
improvements reflected in the consolidated balance sheets and the capital
expenditures reflected in investing activities in the consolidated statements of
cash flows management determined that the appropriate interpretation of
financial accounting standards board technical bulletin no 881 issues
relating to accounting for leases requires these incentives to be recorded as
deferred rent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and as a component
of operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows
additionally this adjustment resulted in a reclassification of the deferred
rent amortization from depreciation and amortization expense to selling general
and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income and
included as an additional cost component of capital expenditures in investing
activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows

finally the company had historically recognized rent holiday periods on a
straightline basis over the lease term commencing on the related retail store
opening date the store opening date coincides with the commencement of business
operations which is the intended use of the property management reevaluated
financial accounting standards board technical bulletin no 853 accounting
for operating leases with scheduled rent increases and determined that
consistent with the letter issued by the office of the chief accountant the
lease term should include the preopening period of construction renovation
fixturing and merchandise placement typically two to six months prior to store
opening the correction of this error requires the company to record additional
deferred rent in other accrued expenses and other longterm liabilities and to
adjust retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheets as well as to
restate rent expense in selling general and administrative expenses in the
consolidated statements of income

the cumulative effect of these corrections is a reduction to retained earnings
of 30 million net of taxes of 17 million as of the beginning of fiscal
2002 and reductions to retained earnings of 13 million net of taxes of 08
million 08 million net of taxes of 04 million and 06 million net of
taxes of 04 million for the fiscal years ended 2004 2003 and 2002
respectively these adjustments did not have any impact on the overall cash
flows of the company

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the effects
of this restatement on the companys consolidated balance sheet as of december
27 2003 as well as the companys consolidated statements of income and cash
flows for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 the accompanying discussion in
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations gives effect to these corrections

seasonality and weather

the companys business is highly seasonal historically the companys sales and
profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of each
year due to the sale of seasonal products the company typically operates at
approximately break even in the first fiscal quarter of each year unseasonable
weather excessive rain drought and early or late frosts may also affect the
companys sales the company believes however that the impact of adverse
weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of its
stores

the company experiences a buildup of inventory and accounts payable during its
first fiscal quarter each year for purchases of seasonal product in anticipation
of the april through june spring selling season and again during its third
fiscal quarter in anticipation of the october through december winter selling
season

significant accounting policies and estimates

managements discussion and analysis of the companys financial position and
results of operations are based upon the companys consolidated financial
statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial
statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and
related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the companys
significant accounting policies including areas of critical management
judgments and estimates have primary impact on the following financial
statement areas

            inventory valuation                    self insurance
            sales returns

the companys critical accounting policies are subject to judgments and
uncertainties which affect the application of such policies see note 1 to the
notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for a
discussion of the companys critical accounting policies the companys
financial position andor results of operations may be materially different when
reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the
application of such policies in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be
different from actual amounts adjustments are made in subsequent periods to
reflect more current information

company changed its accounting methods for the amortization of leasehold
improvements leasehold improvements funded by landlord incentives and rent

fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003

net sales increased 181 to 17388 million in fiscal 2004 from 14729
million in fiscal 2003 this increase resulted from the opening of new stores as
well as a samestore sales improvement of 99 the companys favorable
performance versus prior year was driven primarily by the opening of 53 new
stores market share gains in certain markets continued improvement in
merchandising programs and successful implementation of new initiatives in
presentation purchasing and product selection samestore sales increases were
generally experienced across all product lines with equine pet and animal
products representing the strongest category the companys average ticket
increased 47 to 3983 for the twelve months ended fiscal 2004 increased
average transaction counts also contributed to the increase in samestore sales
the samestore sales increase includes an approximate 26 gain for fiscal year
2004 which is attributed to increases in selling prices resulting from rising
steel grain and petroleumrelated product costs

in fiscal 2004 the company opened 53 new stores compared to 31 in the prior
year relocated 20 stores compared to 18 in the prior year and closed one
store compared to one in the prior year

as a percent of sales gross margin decreased 30 basis points to 302 for
fiscal 2004 from 305 for fiscal 2003 gross margin was negatively impacted
primarily by higher than anticipated freight costs caused primarily by
increased fuel costs and demand in the freight industry and absorption of some
of the impact of higher steel and other commodity costs the impact of cost
increases was partially recovered through higher selling prices

as a percent of sales selling general and administrative sga expenses
were 228 and 225 for fiscal 2004 and 2003 respectively the loss in sga
leverage was due primarily to approximately 32 million in expenses incurred
for the consolidation and relocation of the companys store support center
additionally new store openings trailed behind schedule during the middle of
the year resulting in a reduction of sales leverage for related expenses

depreciation and amortization expense increased 259 in fiscal 2004 over the
prior year due mainly to costs associated with new and relocated stores
remodeled existing stores and new distribution facilities

net interest expense decreased 582 in fiscal 2004 from the prior year this
decrease reflects stronger cash flow and less cash requirements for store
openings which resulted in reduced average longterm borrowings under the
companys revolving credit agreement


                                       17
page

the companys effective tax rate was 360 for fiscal 2004 compared to 376 in
the prior year resulting primarily from a lower effective state income tax rate
due to the allocation of income by state

as a result of the foregoing factors net income for fiscal 2004 increased to
641 million or 157 per diluted share compared to net income of 557
million or 138 per diluted share in the prior year exclusive of the
cumulative effect of the change in 2003 in the companys method of accounting
for consideration received from vendors net income for fiscal 2003 was 576
million or 143 per diluted share the increase in net income for fiscal 2004
is primarily a result of the factors discussed above and leveraging operating
costs with the opening of new stores

fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002

net sales increased 217 to 14729 million in fiscal 2003 from 12100
million in fiscal 2002 this increase resulted from the opening of new stores as
well as a samestore sales improvement of 70 the companys favorable
performance versus prior year was driven primarily by the opening of 31 new
stores market share gains in certain markets continued improvement in
merchandising programs improved instore execution and the first full year of
operations for the 113 stores opened in fiscal 2002 in fiscal 2003 the company
opened 31 new stores compared to 113 in the prior year closed one store
compared to three in the prior year and relocated 18 stores compared to 16 in
the prior year the company substantially expanded its store base during 2002
due to its purchase of property and lease rights from quality stores inc

as a percent of sales gross margin increased 220 basis points to 305 for
fiscal 2003 from 283 for fiscal 2002 assuming the provisions of eitf 0216
had been applied prior to fiscal 2002 fiscal 2003 gross margin would have
decreased 40 basis points from 309 in fiscal 2002 the majority of this
decline is attributable to a return to a more normal level of vendor funding in
fiscal 2003 specifically vendors provided additional funds in fiscal 2002 in
connection with the opening of 87 new stores as a result of the purchase of
certain properties and lease rights from quality stores inc

as a percent of sales sga expenses were 225 and 215 for fiscal 2003 and
2002 respectively assuming the provisions of eitf 0216 had been applied prior
to fiscal 2002 and exclusive of nonrecurring expansion costs of 107 million
experienced in fiscal 2002 these costs include preopening transition and
training costs related to the 87 new stores costs for store relocations and
three store closings as a result of the purchase of the aforementioned
properties and lease rights from quality stores inc fiscal 2003 sga
expenses as a percent of sales decreased 80 basis points from 233 for fiscal
2002 this decrease is primarily a result of controlled spending and greater
leverage from increased sales

depreciation and amortization expense increased 202 in fiscal 2003 over the
prior year due mainly to costs associated with new and relocated stores as well
as remodeled existing stores

net interest expense decreased 268 in fiscal 2003 over the prior year this
decrease reflects stronger cash flow and less cash requirements for store
openings which resulted in reduced average longterm borrowings under the
companys revolving credit agreement

the companys effective tax rate increased to 376 for fiscal 2003 compared
with 362 for fiscal 2002 this increase is due to increased income in states
with higher tax rates

as a result of the foregoing factors net income for fiscal 2003 increased to
557 million or 138 per diluted share compared to net income of 382
million or 097 per diluted share in the prior year exclusive of the
cumulative effect of the accounting change net income for fiscal 2003 was 576
million or 143 per diluted share this increase is primarily a result of
increased leverage from increased sales at both new and existing stores
additionally certain store expansion costs incurred in the companys
significant expansion in 2002 which was primarily the result of the purchase of
property and lease rights from quality stores inc in the first quarter of
2002 were nonrecurring the expansion increased the size of the company by
over 25 and was completed in a very compressed timeframe as such the company
incurred significant incremental costs to achieve the state of readiness
required to enable all stores to open within the desired time frame and such
costs are not considered by management to be indicative of normal preopening or
recurring expenses management believes that disclosing the effect of the
significant 2002 store expansion improves the investors ability to reasonably
evaluate the companys longerterm business trends

change in accounting principle

emerging issue task force issue no 0216 eitf 0216 accounting by a
customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a
vendor provides guidance for the accounting treatment and income statement
classification for consideration given by a vendor to a retailer in connection
with the sale of the vendors products or for the promotion of sales of the
vendors products the eitf concluded that such consideration received from
vendors should be reflected as a decrease in prices paid for inventory and
recognized in cost of sales as the related inventory is sold prior to adopting
this pronouncement the company classified all vendorprovided marketing support
funds as a reduction in selling general and administrative expenses

the effect of applying eitf 0216 on priorperiod financial statements would
have resulted in a change to previously reported net income thus the company
has reported the adoption of eitf 0216 as a cumulative effect adjustment
accordingly in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 the company recorded a
cumulative effect of accounting change of 31 million 19 million net of
income taxes for the impact of this adoption on prior fiscal years

28 2002 reflects the impact of eitf 0216 as if it had been adopted prior to

the increases in cash and cash equivalents prepaid expenses and other current
assets and accrued expenses is generally due to the increase in the number of
stores in operation and resulting increases in sales growth in operations and
timing of payments

the increase in inventories and related increase in accounts payable resulted
primarily from additional inventory for new stores and an increase in average
inventory per store due to increased sales expectations and increased cost of
certain products containing steel grain or petroleum trade credit arises from
the companys vendors granting extended payment terms for inventory purchases
payment terms generally vary from 30 days to 180 days depending on the inventory
product

during the year and the timing of payments

from fiscal 2002 is primarily due to changes in the following operating
activities in millions

the increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2003 compared with
fiscal 2002 is primarily due to the increase in the number of stores in
operation in addition to the 31 stores opened in 2003 it was also the first
full year of operations for the 113 stores opened in 2002 as a result of this
aggressive expansion the company experienced a dramatic increase in all working
capital components strong sales performance generated increased cash flows and
inventory requirements thereby driving proportionate increases in operating
expenses

financing activities

financing activities provided 192 million used 143 million and provided
208 million in fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively largely as a result
of borrowing requirements created by operations partially offset by proceeds
received from the issuance of stock under stock incentive programs

the company believes that its cash flow from operations borrowings available
under the credit agreement and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund
the companys operations and its capital expenditure needs including store
openings relocations and renovations over the next several years

offbalance sheet arrangements

the extent of the companys offbalance sheet arrangements is operating leases
and outstanding letters of credit the balances for these arrangements are
discussed above leasing buildings and equipment for retail stores and offices
rather than acquiring these significant assets allows the company to utilize
financial capital to operate the business rather than maintain assets letters
of credit allow the company to purchase inventory in a timely manner

known trends events demands commitments and uncertainties

litigation and internal investigation

in july 2004 a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the
chancery court for davidson county tennessee by the hawaii laborers pension
plan against each of the companys directors certain of its officers and one
former director the company was named as a nominal defendant on september 17
2004 the plaintiff filed an amended complaint which alleged breaches of
fiduciary duty acts of bad faith abuse of control mismanagement waste of
corporate assets unjust enrichment and other violations of tennessee law
relating to the preparation of the companys financial statements the amended
complaint sought on behalf of the company unspecified damages a constructive
trust on certain of the defendants proceeds from selling company stock
injunctive relief restitution the plaintiffs costs and disbursements and such
other relief as the court deemed proper

on october 8 2004 the company moved to dismiss the amended complaint for
failure to make a presuit demand on the board of directors on december 3
2004 the court granted the companys motion to dismiss and ordered that all
claims in the amended complaint be dismissed without prejudice on february 17
2005 the court entered an order denying a motion by the plaintiff to alter or
amend the december 3 2004 order and judgment dismissing the amended complaint
the plaintiff has until march 21 2005 to file a notice of appeal of the order

the audit committee of the board of directors has completed its previously
disclosed investigation of the claims set forth in the derivative lawsuit in
july 2004 shortly after the company learned of the derivative lawsuit the
board of directors directed the audit committee to conduct an investigation of
the allegations these allegations concerned the companys accounting accruals
and reserves for inventory employee bonuses payrollrelated liabilities and
vendor credits the audit committee promptly retained independent legal counsel
with no prior connection to the company to assist the audit committee in
evaluating these issues the audit committee and its advisors were provided with
full access to company employees and documents during the course of the audit
committees investigation independent counsel with the assistance of
accountants that they retained interviewed company employees met with the
companys external auditors and reviewed a substantial amount of documentation
related to the issues described above the audit committee later expanded the
review to encompass the companys other reserves or accruals that involved
management judgment

based on the investigation of the allegations described above the audit
committee determined that there were no material errors requiring restatement of
the companys previously reported financial statements as they relate to such
matters and found no evidence of fraud or misconduct by any of the companys
employees in reaching its conclusion that restatement of the companys
previously reported financial statements was not required the audit committee
considered 1 the impact of the documentation insufficiencies andor errors on
each of the periods affected 2 the lack of any material changes in prior
period trends or earnings 3 the nature of the documentation insufficiencies
and errors and 4 the age of financial statements impacted the audit
committee has reported its findings to the companys board of directors and
management both of whom concurred with the audit committees determination the
companys external auditors have also concurred with the determination


                                       23

while the audit committee determined that restatement of the companys prior
reported financial statements was not required for such matters the audit
committee found the following documentation insufficiencies andor errors

        o       in fiscal 2000 management calculated a total accrual of 43
                million for the companys excess and slow moving inventory
                valuation reserve a 10 million portion of this reserve
                representing approximately 05 of the total year end inventory
                balance relating to costs anticipated to be incurred to move
                inventory from one store location to another was not
                sufficiently supported in fiscal 2001 the rationale and
                calculation of this portion of the reserve was changed to a
                mechanical formula but a 08 million portion of the reserve
                representing 04 of the total year end inventory was still
                not sufficiently supported by the third quarter of fiscal 2002
                the entire inventory valuation reserve was properly supported

        o       due to larger than typical performance based bonuses in fiscal
                2002 the maximum limits on certain fringe benefits were met
                resulting in a lower than estimated fringe benefit expense being
                incurred this circumstance resulted in the yearend estimate
                being overstated by 790000 also due to forfeitures resulting
                from employee terminations after the end of year the companys
                ultimate incentive payments for fiscal 2002 were reduced by
                137000 the combination of these two circumstances resulted in
                the companys incentive expense for the first quarter of fiscal
                2003 being reduced by 927000

        o       in estimating certain payrollrelated liabilities for fiscal
                1999 through the second quarter of fiscal 2004 management did
                not sufficiently document its rationale and support for certain
                judgments concerning estimated claims incurred but not reported
                for medical costs workers compensation and general liability
                since the second quarter of fiscal 2004 the rationale and
                support for these liabilities have been fully documented

the audit committee concluded that the items addressed above have been fully
corrected also noting that management has dedicated additional accounting and
other resources to these areas to further enhance controls

following the december 2004 dismissal of the derivative suit attorneys
representing the plaintiff in the shareholder derivative suit wrote the
companys board of directors demanding that the company commence legal
proceedings against the directors and officers whom the plaintiff had
unsuccessfully sued for essentially the same matters alleged in the derivative
suit the companys board of directors engaged the independent legal counsel and
legal counsel retained the accountants which assisted the audit committee in its
investigation of the allegations in the derivative suit to advise the board with
respect to the demand following a review of the investigation of the
allegations set forth in the demand letter and the derivative suit the
nonemployee members of the companys board of directors determined that the
claims proposed in the demand letter and derivative suit have no merit and that
pursuing such claims would not be in the best interests of the company based on
this determination the companys board of directors refused the shareholders
demand to pursue legal action

self insurance

during the third fiscal quarter of 2004 the company determined through
assistance with insurance industry analysts that one of its former insurance
carriers appears insolvent the carrier insures the company for both workers
compensation and general liability claims for policy years 1999 through 2001
the companys exposure to related claims are at risk of not being limited to
previously established stoploss aggregates a charge of 05 million was
recognized in the current year for the estimated additional cost to the company
due to the expected loss of stoploss coverage this additional estimated
liability was determined using a third party actuary service there can be no
assurance that the company will not incur additional claims in excess of the
estimated amounts

sales tax compliance

a portion of the companys sales are with taxexempt customers the company
obtains exemption information as a necessary part of each tax exempt
transaction many of the states in which the company conducts business will
audit the company to verify its compliance with applicable sales tax laws the
business activities of the companys customers and the intended use of the
unique products sold by the company create a challenging and complex environment
of compliance these circumstances also create some risk that the company could
be challenged as to the propriety of its sales tax compliance while the company
believes it reasonably enforces sales tax compliance with its customers and
endeavors to fully comply with all applicable sales tax regulations there can
be no assurance that the company upon final completion of such audits would
not have a significant liability for disallowed exemptions management believes
it has adequately provided for such liability based on known assessments and
expected settlements

recent accounting pronouncements

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb published
fasb statement no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment sfas 123r or
the statement sfas 123r requires that the compensation cost relating to
sharebased payment transactions including grants of employee stock options be
recognized in financial statements that cost will be measured based on the fair
value of the equity or liability instruments issued sfas 123r covers a wide
range of sharebased compensation arrangements including stock options
restricted share plans performancebased awards share appreciation rights and
employee share purchase plans

sfas 123r specifies that the fair value of an employee stock option must be
based on an observable market price or if an observable market price is not
available the fair value must be estimated using a valuation technique meeting
specific criteria established in the standard

the statement is effective for public companies at the beginning of the first
interim or annual period beginning after june 15 2005 the third quarter of
fiscal 2005 for the company the statement will have no impact on the companys
overall financial position the impact of this statement on the companys
results of operations in fiscal 2005 and beyond is expected to be significant
and will depend upon various factors among them being future compensation
strategies the impact of adoption of this statement cannot be predicted at this
time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the
future the proforma compensation costs presented in note 1 to the notes to
consolidated financial statements and in prior filings for the company have been
calculated using a blackscholes option pricing model and may not be indicative
of amounts which should be expected in future years as of the date of this
filing the company has not determined which option pricing model is most
appropriate for future option grants or which method of adoption the company
will apply

in november 2004 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards
no 151 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4 sfas 151
the purpose of this statement is to clarify the accounting of abnormal amounts
of idle facility expense freight handling costs and waste material arb no 43
stated that under some circumstances these costs may be so abnormal that they
are required to be treated as current period costs sfas 151 requires that these
costs be treated as current period costs regardless if they meet the criteria of
so abnormal the provisions of sfas 151 shall be effective for inventory costs
incurred during fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 although the company
will continue to evaluate the application of sfas 151 management does not
believe adoption will have a material impact on its results of operations or
financial position

in december 2004 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards
no 153 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 29
sfas 153 sfas 153 is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary
assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged sfas
153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods
beginning after june 15 2005 with earlier application permitted although the
company will continue to evaluate the application of sfas 153 management does
not believe adoption will have a material impact on its results of operations or
financial position

risk factors

effect of inflation on operations
although the company cannot accurately determine the full effect of inflation on
its operations it believes its sales and results of operations have been
affected by inflation during fiscal 2004 the company recognized a lifo charge
of approximately 96 million relating to inflation in certain product
categories such as steel grain and petroleum based products the company has
also experienced inflation in transportation and other costs the company
increased its retail prices to recoup a portion of this inflation resulting in
a positive impact on samestore sales of an estimated 26 the company is
subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and
services which include among other items steel grain petroleum corn
soybean and other commodities as well as transportation services if prices of
these materials and services continue to increase in a significant manner
consumer demand may fall andor the company may not be able to pass such
increases on to its customers and as a result sales andor gross margins could
decline the company has been successful in reducing or mitigating the effects
of inflation principally through selective buying from the most competitive
vendors and by increasing retail prices due to the competitive environment
such conditions have and may continue to adversely impact the companys gross
margins

growth through opening new stores
the companys key business strategy is to expand its base of tractor supply
company stores if the company is unable to implement this strategy the
companys ability to increase its sales profitability and cash flow could be
impaired significantly to the extent that the company is unable to open new
stores as the company anticipates due to unforeseen delays in construction or
site approval the companys sales growth would be dependent on increases in
samestore sales

management of growth
even if the company is able to implement to a significant degree its key
business strategy of expanding its store base it may experience managerial or
operational problems which may prevent any significant increase in
profitability or negatively impact its cash flow

competition
the company operates in a highly competitive market the principal competitive
factors include location of stores price and quality of merchandise instock
consistency merchandise assortment and presentation and customer service the
company believes it has successfully differentiated itself from general
merchandise home center retailers and other specialty and discount retailers by
focusing on its specialized market niche ie supplying the lifestyle needs of
recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle as
well as tradesmen and small businesses however the company does face select
competition from these entities as well as competition from independently owned
retail farm and ranch stores several privatelyheld regional farm store chains
and farm cooperatives some of these competitors are units of large national or
regional chains that have substantially greater financial and other resources
than the company

improvements to the companys supply chain may not be fully successful
an important part of the companys efforts to achieve efficiencies cost
reductions and sales and cash flow growth is the identification and
implementation of improvements to the companys supply chain including
inventory replenishment systems merchandise ordering transportation and
receipt processing significant changes to the companys supply chain could have
a materially adverse impact on operating results

changes in customer demands could materially adversely affect the companys
sales operating results and cash flow
the companys success depends on its ability to anticipate and respond in a
timely manner to changing customer demand and preferences for products and
supplies used in recreational farming and ranching if the company misjudges the
market the company may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced
to take significant inventory markdowns however shortages of key items could
also have a materially adverse impact on operating results

risks relating to foreign suppliers
the company relies on foreign manufacturers for various products that we sell
in addition many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products
from foreign sources this reliance increases the risk of inadequate and
untimely supplies of various products due to local political economic social
or environmental conditions transportation delays restrictive actions by
foreign governments or changes in united states laws and regulations affecting
imports or domestic distribution

seasonality and weather
the companys business is highly seasonal historically the companys sales and
profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of each
year due to the sale of seasonal products the company typically operates at
approximately break even in the first quarter of each year unseasonable
weather excessive rain drought and early or late frosts during the second or
fourth quarters of each year could have a significant affect the companys sales
and results of operations the company believes however that the impact of
adverse weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of
its stores

our information systems may prove inadequate
the company depends on management information systems for many aspects of its
business the company will be materially adversely affected if management
information systems are disrupted or it is unable to improve upgrade maintain
and expand systems particularly in light of the continued significant increases
in the number of stores



item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement as a means of managing
its interest rate exposure this agreement which matured in november 2003 had
the effect of converting certain of the companys variable rate obligations to
fixed rate obligations net amounts paid or received are reflected as an
adjustment to interest expense

the company complies with sfas nos 133 137 and 138 collectively sfas 133
pertaining to the accounting for derivatives and hedging activities sfas 133
requires the company to recognize all derivative instruments in the balance
sheet at fair value sfas 133 impacted the accounting for the companys interest
rate swap agreement which was designated as a cash flow hedge

the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from its credit
agreement the credit agreement bears interest at either the banks base rate
525 and 400 at december 25 2004 and december 27 2003 respectively or
libor 242 and 114 at december 25 2004 and december 27 2003 respectively
plus an additional amount ranging from 075 to 150 per annum adjusted
quarterly based on company performance 075 at both december 25 2004 and
december 27 2003 the company is also required to pay quarterly in arrears a
commitment fee ranging from 020 to 035 based on the daily average unused
portion of the credit line a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move
increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would
result in approximately 98000 of additional annual interest expense and would
not impact the fair market value of the longterm debt

     supply for its products and believes that adequate sources of supply exist
     at substantially similar costs for substantially all of its products

     exclusively on all replenishment and forecasting functions this
     centralized direction permits the buying team to focus more strategic
     attention toward vendor line reviews assortment planning and testing of
     more new products and programs through the combined efforts of these
     teams the company expects to continually improve overall inventory
     productivity and instock position

     company promotes broad selections of merchandise primarily advertised at
     the regular everyday low price with color circulars the company also runs
     periodic special events promoted through local flyers circulars and radio
     advertising the company enhances its print marketing and advertising
     programs through the expanded use of national and local cable network
     television due to the geographic dispersion of the companys stores the
     use of national cable network advertising is generally more costeffective
     and additionally serves to promote the company in advance of entering a new
     market

     store due to the relatively small size of its stores increased traffic in
     the store ensures increased exposure to most products as such the
     companys vendors are committed to helping the company promote its brand
     and position itself as a destination store vendors provide assistance with
     product presentation and rack design brochures point of purchase
     materials for customers education and product education for employees

     its specialized market niche ie the rural lifestyle and maintenance
     needs of recreational farmers and ranchers as well as tradesmen and small
     businesses however the company does face select competition from these
     entities as well as competition from independently owned retail farm and
     ranch stores several privatelyheld regional farm store chains and farm
     cooperatives some of these competitors are units of large national or
     regional chains that have substantially greater financial and other
     resources than the company

growth strategy

the companys current and longterm growth strategy is built on a combination of
1 expanded geographic market presence achieved through the opening of new
retail stores and 2 enhanced financial performance through samestore sales
increases achieved through aggressive merchandising programs with an everyday
low prices philosophy supported by strong customer service

the company has experienced considerable growth in recent years including the
addition of 18 stores in fiscal 2001 113 in fiscal 2002 and 31 in fiscal 2003
this recent growth has increased the companys market presence in the southwest
primarily in texas the southeast primarily in florida in the central
northern part of the united states primarily in ohio michigan and indiana and
in the northeast primarily in new york and pennsylvania the company operated
463 stores in 30 states as of december 27 2003 and has plans to open 52 stores
in fiscal 2004 the company plans to open 60 to 65 new stores in fiscal 2005 and
additional stores thereafter the company believes it has developed a
sophisticated proven method for selecting store sites and has identified over
800 potential additional markets for new stores in the united states in
addition the company continues to identify opportunities to relocate existing
stores

the companys strategy is generally to lease its new stores at december 27
2003 393 of the companys 463 stores are leased assuming that new stores are
leased the estimated cash required to open a new store is approximately
900000 to 1100000 the majority of which is for initial acquisition of
inventory and capital expenditures principally leasehold improvements and
fixtures and equipment and the balance of which is for preopening expenses

the company plans to relocate a total of 18 to 20 stores in both fiscal 2004 and
2005 and an average of three or four additional stores each year over the next
several years store relocations are typically undertaken to move small older
stores to fullsize formats in prime retail areas the company has relocated 35
stores since 2001 we recognize certain properties have declined in physical
appearance and in certain markets the retail and traffic flows are shifting

                                       5
page

through relocations we are able to keep much of our existing loyal customer
base but expand the overall reach to new customers thereby growing the
business the cash required to complete a store relocation typically ranges from
300000 to 600000 depending on whether the company is responsible for any
renovation or remodeling costs

saturday of the calendar year references to fiscal year mean the year in which
that fiscal year began each of the fiscal years ended december 27 2003
december 28 2002 and december 29 2001 contain 52 weeks

the companys current and longterm growth strategy is to 1 expand geographic
market presence achieved by opening new retail stores and 2 enhance financial
performance through samestore sales increases achieved through aggressive
merchandising programs with an everyday low prices philosophy supported by
strong customer service

the company has experienced considerable growth in recent years including the
addition of 18 stores in fiscal 2001 113 in fiscal 2002 and 31 in fiscal 2003
the significant growth in 2002 is due primarily to the acquisition of real
property and lease rights from quality stores inc see note 16 of notes to the
consolidated financial statements contained in this report for further
discussion regarding this purchase this growth has increased the companys
market presence in the southeast primarily in florida in the central northern
part of the united states primarily in ohio and michigan and in the northeast
primarily in new york and pennsylvania the company operated 463 stores in 30
states as of december 27 2003 and plans to open 52 stores in fiscal 2004 the
company plans to open 60 to 65 new stores in fiscal 2005 and additional stores
thereafter the company has identified over 800 potential additional locations
for new stores in the united states in addition the company continues to
identify opportunities to relocate existing stores

additionally the company has placed significant emphasis on its merchandising
programs evaluating the sales and profitability of its products through
detailed line reviews review of vendor performance measures and modification of
the overall product offerings these efforts coupled with a strong marketing
program and indepth product knowledge training of store employees have
enhanced sales improved gross margins and generated improved overall financial
performance

seasonality and weather

the companys business is highly seasonal historically the companys sales and
profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of each
year due to the sale of seasonal products the company typically operates at a
net loss in the first fiscal quarter of each year unseasonable weather
excessive rain drought and early or late frosts may also affect the companys
sales the company believes however that the impact of adverse weather
conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of its stores

the company experiences a buildup of inventory and accounts payable during its
first fiscal quarter each year for purchases of seasonal product in anticipation
of the april through june spring selling season and again during its third
fiscal quarter in anticipation of the october through december winter selling
season

significant accounting policies and estimates

managements discussion and analysis of the companys financial position and
results of operations are based upon the companys consolidated financial
statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial
statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and
related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the companys
significant accounting policies including areas of critical management
judgments and estimates have primary impact on the following financial
statement areas

        inventory valuation                          self insurance
        sales returns

the companys critical accounting policies are subject to judgments and
uncertainties which affect the application of such policies see note 1 to the
notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for a
discussion of the companys critical accounting policies the companys
financial position andor results of operations may be materially different when
reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the
application of such policies in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be
different from actual amounts adjustments are made in subsequent periods to
reflect more current information

change in accounting principle

emerging issue task force issue no 0216 eitf 0216 accounting by a
customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a
vendor provides guidance for the accounting treatment and income statement
classification for consideration given by a vendor to a retailer in connection
with the sale of the vendors products or for the promotion of sales of the
vendors products the eitf concluded that such consideration received from
vendors should be reflected as a decrease in prices paid for inventory and
recognized in cost of sales as the related inventory is sold prior to adopting
this pronouncement the company classified all vendorprovided marketing support
funds as a reduction in selling general and administrative expenses

the effect of applying eitf 0216 on priorperiod financial statements would
have resulted in a change to previously reported net income thus the company
has reported the adoption of eitf 0216 as a cumulative effect adjustment
accordingly in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 the company recorded a
cumulative effect of accounting change of 31 million 19 million net of
income taxes for the impact of this adoption on prior fiscal years

28 2002 reflects the impact of eitf 0216 as if it had been adopted prior to

fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002

net sales increased 217 to 14729 million in fiscal 2003 from 12100
million in fiscal 2002 this increase resulted from the opening of new stores as
well as a samestore sales improvement of 70 the companys favorable
performance versus prior year was driven primarily by market share gains in
certain markets continued improvement in merchandising programs and improved
instore execution in fiscal 2003 the company opened 31 new stores compared
to 113 in the prior year closed one store compared to three in the prior
year and relocated 18 stores compared to 16 in the prior year the company
substantially expanded its store base during 2002 due to its purchase of
property and lease rights from quality stores inc see note 16 of notes to the
consolidated financial statements contained in this report for further
discussion regarding this purchase

as a percent of sales gross margin increased 220 basis points from 283 for
fiscal 2002 to 305 for fiscal 2003 assuming the provisions of eitf 0216 had
been applied prior to 2002 fiscal 2003 gross margin would have decreased 40
basis points from 309 in fiscal 2002 the majority of this decline is
attributable to a return to a more normal level of vendor funding in fiscal
2003 specifically vendors provided additional funds in fiscal 2002 in
connection with the opening of 87 new stores as a result of the purchase of
certain properties and lease rights from quality stores inc

as a percent of sales selling general and administrative sga expenses
were 226 and 215 for fiscal 2003 and 2002 respectively assuming the
provisions of eitf 0216 had been applied prior to fiscal 2002 and exclusive of
nonrecurring expansion costs of 107 million experienced in fiscal 2002 these
costs include preopening transition and training costs related to the 87 new
stores costs for store relocations and three store closings as a result of the
purchase of the aforementioned properties and lease rights from quality stores
inc fiscal 2003 sga expenses as a percent of sales decreased 80 basis points
from 234 for fiscal 2002 this decrease is primarily a result of controlled
spending and greater leverage from increased sales

depreciation and amortization expense increased 201 in fiscal 2003 over the
prior year due mainly to costs associated with new and relocated stores as well
as remodeled existing stores

net interest expense decreased 268 in fiscal 2003 over the prior year this
decrease reflects stronger cash flow and less cash requirements for store
openings which resulted in reduced average longterm borrowings under the
companys revolving credit agreement

                                       15
page

the companys effective tax rate increased to 375 for fiscal 2003 compared
with 362 for fiscal 2002 this increase is due to increased income in states
with higher tax rates

as a result of the foregoing factors net income for fiscal 2003 increased to
565 million or 140 per diluted share compared to net income of 377
million or 099 per diluted share in the prior year exclusive of the
cumulative effect of the accounting change net income for fiscal 2003 was 584
million or 145 per diluted share this increase is primarily a result of
increased leverage from increased sales at both new and existing stores
additionally certain store expansion costs incurred in the companys
significant expansion in 2002 which was primarily the result of the purchase of
property and lease rights from quality stores inc in the first quarter of
2002 were nonrecurring the expansion increased the size of the company by
over 25 and was completed in a very compressed timeframe as such the company
incurred significant incremental costs to achieve the state of readiness
required to enable all stores to open within the desired time frame and such
costs are not considered by management to be indicative of normal preopening or
recurring expenses management believes that disclosing the effect of the
significant 2002 store expansion improves the investors ability to reasonably
evaluate the companys longerterm business trends

0216 and the expansion costs related to the 2002 store expansion in thousands

in fiscal 2001 this increase resulted from the opening of new stores as well as
a samestore sales improvement of 96 the significant improvement in
samestore sales in fiscal 2002 is due primarily to new merchandising programs
special promotions market share gains in certain markets and improved instore

the prior year closed three stores compared to none in the prior year and
relocated 16 stores compared to one in the prior year

as a percent of sales gross margin increased to 283 in fiscal 2002 from 269

expansion costs sga expense as a percent of sales decreased 04 percentage
point to 206 for fiscal 2002 on an absolute basis sga expenses increased
460 to 2603 million these increases primarily reflect the incremental

accruals

liquidity and capital resources

in addition to normal operating expenses the companys primary ongoing cash
requirements are for expansion remodeling and relocation programs including
inventory purchases and capital expenditures the companys primary ongoing
sources of liquidity are funds provided from operations commitments available
under its revolving credit agreement and normal trade credit the companys
inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third
fiscal quarters in anticipation of the spring and winter selling seasons
respectively

at december 27 2003 the company had working capital of 1775 million a 370
million increase from december 28 2002 this increase is primarily attributable
to the changes in the following components of current assets and current
liabilities in millions

the increases in cash and cash equivalents prepaid expenses and accrued
expenses is generally due to the increase in the number of stores in operation
and resulting increases in sales growth in operations and timing of payments

the increase in inventories and related increase in trade credit resulted
primarily from additional inventory for new stores and a slight increase in
average inventory per store due to increased sales expectations trade credit
arises from the companys vendors granting extended payment terms for inventory
purchases payment terms vary from 30 days to 180 days depending on the
inventory product

the decrease in current maturities of long term debt is due to the maturity of
the companys loan agreement and term note in november 2003 see note 5 of
notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for
further discussion regarding this maturity

in august 2002 the company entered into a replacement unsecured senior
revolving credit facility the credit agreement with bank of america na
as agent for a lender group expanding the maximum available borrowings to 155
million and extending the maturity to february 2006 the balance of funds
available under the credit agreement may be utilized for borrowings including
up to 50 million for letters of credit the credit agreement bears interest at
either the banks base rate 40 at december 27 2003 or the london interbank

ranging from 075 to 15 per annum adjusted quarterly based on company
performance 075 at december 27 2003 the company is also required to pay
quarterly in arrears a commitment fee ranging from 020 to 035 020 at
december 27 2003 per annum adjusted quarterly based on company performance
on the average daily unused portion of the credit agreement there are no
compensating balance requirements associated with the credit agreement the
company expects to continue borrowing amounts under the credit agreement from
time to time to fund its growth and expansion programs and as a source of
seasonal working capital

the credit agreement contains certain restrictions regarding additional
indebtedness capital expenditures business operations guarantees
investments mergers consolidations and sales of assets transactions with
subsidiaries or affiliates and liens in addition the company must comply with
certain quarterly restrictions based on a rolling fourquarters basis
regarding net worth leverage ratio fixed charge coverage and current ratio
requirements the company was in compliance with all covenants at december 27
2003

on january 28 2004 the credit agreement was amended to extend the maturity
date to february 28 2007 additionally the amendment included changes to
certain financial covenants primarily to permit greater flexibility for capital
expenditures in accordance with the companys growth plans

operations provided net cash of 621 million in fiscal 2003 467 million in
fiscal 2002 and 471 million in fiscal 2001 the 154 million increase in
fiscal 2003 over fiscal 2002 is primarily due to changes in the following
operating activities in millions




                                                            2003        2002       variance

the increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2003 compared with
fiscal 2002 is primarily due to the increase in the number of stores in
operation in addition to the 31 stores opened in 2003 it was also the first
full year of operations for the 113 stores opened in 2002 as a result of this
aggressive expansion the company experienced a dramatic increase in all working
capital components strong sales performance generated increased cash flows and
inventory requirements thereby driving proportionate increases in operating
expenses

the 04 million decrease in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2002 from
fiscal 2001 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities
in millions




                                                            2002        2001       variance

the decrease in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2002 compared with
fiscal 2001 is primarily due to the addition of 113 new stores during fiscal
2002 compared with 18 new stores in fiscal 2001 the significant expansion
coupled with strong sales performance increased the need for inventories beyond
typical vendor leveraging and increased related operating expenses in support
of the growing operations

investing activities used 416 million 626 million and 107 million in
fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the majority of this cash requirement
relates to the companys capital expenditures

the companys significant store expansion coupled with required investment in
infrastructure costs required the following capital expenditures in
thousands

the companys longterm growth strategy anticipates continued geographic market
expansion and further concentration within existing markets these additional
stores will require continuing investment in distribution capacity information
technology and people the company currently estimates that capital expenditures
will be approximately 860 million in fiscal 2004 as follows in thousands

   new and relocated stores and stores not yet opened        25000

financing activities used 143 million provided 208 million and used 366
million in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively largely as a result of
borrowing requirements created by operations partially offset by proceeds
received from the exercise of stock options

the company believes that its cash flow from operations borrowings available
under the credit agreement and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund
the companys operations and its capital expenditure needs including store
openings and renovations over the next several years

environmental matters

in connection with a contaminated leased store property vacated by the company
upon relocation in 2002 the company has agreed to indemnify the property owner
with respect to an environmental liability associated with the use of the
property as defined in the related lease agreement during fiscal 2003 the
company has not paid or accrued material amounts related to this property the
company does not expect the expense of these activities to

                                       21

exceed 01 million however because of the uncertainties associated with
environmental assessment and remediation activities the companys future
expenses to remediate the currently identified site could be higher than amounts
accrued future expenditures for environmental remediation may be affected in
the nearterm by identification of additional contaminated sites the level and
type of contamination found and the extent and nature of cleanup activities
required

variablerate unsecured senior revolving credit agreement the agreement bears
interest at either the banks base rate 400 and 425 at december 27 2003
and december 28 2002 respectively or libor 114 and 142 at december 27
2003 and december 28 2002 respectively plus an additional amount ranging from

the longterm debt

although the company cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation
on its operations it does not believe its sales or results of operations have
been materially affected by inflation the company has been successful in many
cases in reducing or mitigating the effects of inflation principally by taking
advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale from increased volume
of purchases and selective buying from the most competitive vendors without
sacrificing quality
